    "patient_info": "The patient is a 31-week gestation fetus whose genetic testing indicated significant hearing or visual impairment potentially diagnosed by 18 years of age. Previous testing included chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). There is a family history of first- or second-degree relatives with laboratory abnormalities suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism (IEM). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was ordered by a neurologist, and genetic counseling has not been conducted. The patient is covered by UnitedHealthcare insurance."

    "patient_info": "The patient is a 16-year-old individual with a clinical indication of congenital anomaly. They have undergone Fragile X testing in the past and have a family history of at least one first- or second-degree relative with a history of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer. The patient's insurance provider is UHC, and the genetic tests ordered include Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). The ordering provider is a Developmental Pediatrician, and there is no mention of genetic counseling in the provided information."

    "patient_info": "The 3-year-old patient with Cigna insurance presents with a congenital anomaly affecting a single organ system and a family history indicating a possible genetic etiology. They have undergone prior FISH testing and are now scheduled for whole exome sequencing (WES) as part of their diagnostic workup initiated by their Primary Care Physician. The family history reveals a first- or second-degree relative with a significant immunologic or hematologic disorder. There is no mention of genetic counseling in the patient records."

    "patient_info": "The 19-year-old patient with insurance coverage through BCBS_FEP was referred for genetic testing of BRCA1/2 genes by a Neonatologist due to multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome. The patient had prior karyotype testing completed. The family history includes a first- or second-degree family member with significant hearing or visual impairment diagnosed by 18 years of age. There was no mention of genetic counseling in the patient's records."

    "patient_info": "The patient is a 7-week-old female infant being evaluated by a neonatologist for genetic testing of BRCA1/2 genes due to the clinical indication of having a female family member with a breast cancer diagnosis at 50 years of age or younger. There is no prior genetic testing done, and the family history includes the presence of first- or second-degree relatives with dystonia, ataxia, hemiplegia, neuromuscular disorder, movement disorder, or other neurologic abnormalities. The patient's insurance is through BCBS_FEP, and she has seen a genetic counselor both before testing and will have a follow-up visit after the results are received."

The patient, covered by UnitedHealthcare, has no prior genetic testing and is now undergoing BRCA1/2 testing due to a family history of triple negative breast cancer in a close blood relative. The patient had a pre-test counseling session with a genetic counselor and is scheduled for a post-test visit to discuss the results once they are received."
