There is a family history notable for a maternal uncle with a persistent, severe immunologic disorder, which raised concern for an inherited predisposition that might overlap with neurodevelopmental features. There has been no prior genetic testing, and pre-test genetic counseling was declined by the family; testing is being pursued with coverage through Cigna.",Cigna_MOL.TS_.306.C_Whole_Genome_Sequencing_Cigna_eff01.01.2025_pub09.10.2024.pdf,No,Yes,No
