Case14155,Q1,1,['top1_10retrieve'],"The child is a 7-year-old referred by neurology for evaluation of autism spectrum disorder and whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been requested to assess for genetic contributors to the neurodevelopmental presentation. There is a family history notable for a maternal uncle with a persistent, severe immunologic disorder, which raised concern for an inherited predisposition that might overlap with neurodevelopmental features. There has been no prior genetic testing, and pre-test genetic counseling was declined by the family; testing is being pursued with coverage through Cigna.",Cigna_MOL.TS_.306.C_Whole_Genome_Sequencing_Cigna_eff01.01.2025_pub09.10.2024.pdf,Yes,No,Yes
Case18868,Q1,1,['top1_10retrieve'],"The patient is a 41-year-old with a diagnosis of primary peritoneal carcinoma who was evaluated by a medical geneticist and for whom whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered to assess for an underlying hereditary cancer predisposition; prior karyotype testing was nondiagnostic. Her mother reportedly has a persistent and severe hematologic disorder, which raised concern for a heritable syndrome affecting cancer and hematologic risk. Coverage is through Cigna, and there was no documented record of pre-test genetic counseling in the materials provided.",Cigna_MOL.TS_.306.C_Whole_Genome_Sequencing_Cigna_eff01.01.2025_pub09.10.2024.pdf,No,Yes,No
Case7604,Q2,1,['top3_10retrieve'],The neonate was referred by a neurologist for evaluation of multiple congenital anomalies affecting several organ systems and whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered to evaluate for an underlying genetic etiology. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing was performed previously and was nondiagnostic. There is a family history notable for an older sibling with multiple congenital anomalies. The family has coverage through UHC and they declined genetic counseling at this time.,United Healthcare_whole-exome-and-whole-genome-sequencing.pdf,Yes,No,Yes
Case8288,Q1,1,['top1_10retrieve'],"Fetal imaging at 36 weeks' gestation is concerning for a major congenital cardiac anomaly and the pregnancy was referred by a developmental pediatrician for genetic evaluation. A chromosomal microarray (CMA) was previously performed and was nondiagnostic. There is a family history of an inborn error of metabolism affecting an older sibling, and the parents have had multiple sessions with a genetic counselor. Given the late-gestation identification of a significant cardiac malformation and the nondiagnostic CMA, whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued to evaluate for an underlying genetic etiology that could inform perinatal and postnatal management, with coverage through UHC noted.",United Healthcare_whole-exome-and-whole-genome-sequencing.pdf,Yes,No,Yes
Case8661,Q1,1,['top1_10retrieve'],The patient is a 7-year-old referred by the child's neurologist for evaluation of a significant hearing or visual impairment identified in childhood and whole genome sequencing (WGS) is requested to investigate a possible genetic cause. Fragile X testing was previously performed and was nondiagnostic. There is a family history of a sibling who developed an epileptic encephalopathy before three years of age. Genetic counseling was offered but the family declined pre-test counseling; testing is being pursued with coverage through UHC and plans are in place to provide post-test genetic counseling and genetics follow-up if results are informative.,United Healthcare_whole-exome-and-whole-genome-sequencing.pdf,Yes,Not Specified,Yes
