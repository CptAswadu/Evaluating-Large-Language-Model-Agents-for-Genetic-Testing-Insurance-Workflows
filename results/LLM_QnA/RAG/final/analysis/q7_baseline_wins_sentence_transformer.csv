Case11855,1,['top1_10retrieve'],"The patient is a 14-year-old being evaluated by a developmental pediatrician for a congenital anomaly affecting a single organ system with concern for an underlying genetic etiology, and chromosomal microarray (CMA) is being ordered to assess for copy number variants associated with developmental disorders; Fragile X testing was previously performed and was nondiagnostic. There is a family history notable for a maternal aunt with triple-negative breast cancer, which was discussed as part of the risk assessment during pre-test counseling. Pre-test counseling was completed with a genetic specialist and plans for post-test follow-up were made, and testing will be pursued with coverage through UHC.",United Healthcare_chromosome-microarray-testing.pdf,81228,Not Specified,81228
