Case18868,2,"['top1_30retrieve', 'top3_10retrieve']","The patient is a 41-year-old with a diagnosis of primary peritoneal carcinoma who was evaluated by a medical geneticist and for whom whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered to assess for an underlying hereditary cancer predisposition; prior karyotype testing was nondiagnostic. Her mother reportedly has a persistent and severe hematologic disorder, which raised concern for a heritable syndrome affecting cancer and hematologic risk. Coverage is through Cigna, and there was no documented record of pre-test genetic counseling in the materials provided.",Cigna_MOL.TS_.306.C_Whole_Genome_Sequencing_Cigna_eff01.01.2025_pub09.10.2024.pdf,No,Yes,Yes
Case3592,1,['top1_30retrieve'],"The patient is a neonate evaluated by a developmental pediatrician for unexplained epileptic encephalopathy with neonatal onset and no prior epilepsy multigene panel testing; chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing for developmental disorders is being requested. A prior chromosomal microarray was nondiagnostic. There is a family history of an older sibling with unexplained developmental regression unrelated to autism or epilepsy. Pre-test counseling was discussed with a genetic specialist and post-test follow-up is planned, and testing is being submitted with coverage through Cigna.",Cigna_MOL.TS_.150A_CMA_for_Developmental_Disorders_and_Prenatal_Diagnosis_eff01.01.2025_pub09.10.2024_1.pdf,Yes,No,No
