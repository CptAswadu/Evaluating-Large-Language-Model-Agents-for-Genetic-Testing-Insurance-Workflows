CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that \nencodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome.  (Chung, 2023)  \n \nMost known disease- causing variants are found in the exons, and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient \nanalysis can be completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016) . WES results in long lists \nof genetic variants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify \ndisease causing mutations . (Richards et al., 2015)  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome.  (MedlinePlus , 2020b) . This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions , and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023).  As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and  focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years . \n(Taber et al., 2015)  \n Another type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid (RNA). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transc ribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the \ncollective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA present in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology indications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM), uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at spec ific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications (Mantere et al., 2021). OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n Chung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases. The meta-analysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations over a period of 10 years (2011- 2021). Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility (defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes t o clinical management following a diagnosis by ES or GS), \nrates of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from ES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies and evaluated. The analysi s revealed comparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36- 0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall, and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35- 0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I\n2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%). Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES (2- 579 for GS vs 1- 75 for ES), but the rate of VUS was not significantly different ( p = .78). Of the \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n nine studies (2,269 probands) that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times greater than ES \n(95% CI 0.79- 1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With respect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results. Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% - 16%. A signific ant difference in the diagn ostic rate between ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2,361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40- 0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta-\nanalysis. Additionally, of ten QUADAS -2 assessed, high- quality studies (2,170 probands) reporting on clinical utility, GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30- 0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant published literature. Twenty studies, including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES  and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA, met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was potential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta- regression. Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of  the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%), and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals with short stature and provide a strong base of reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes, which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals.  \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS, for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies su pporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals with this disorder. Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of individuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023)  Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES  or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low - quality evidence was found for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified. Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis. Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately 37 art icles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affected famil y members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unexplained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by  Ewans  et al.  (2018) and Bowling  et al.  (2017), previously discussed  in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used in 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \nwere epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secon dary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS was performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year, and for those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undiagnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use of genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD. The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay (DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for this study, which took pl ace in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. They found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine experienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to \nhigh diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s participants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid- 2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative included COL2A1  (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies ( n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2- 22%). For WGS, outcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes; Hayes notes that additional studies evaluating both larger numbers and a broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n \nAn additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did does not address ID in individuals  with other disorders including NDD or global DD, which are discussed in separate Hayes reports. No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies and subtypes of NDD, Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing (NGS) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel sequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and \n28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was \nnot statically significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p =  .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found in this review compared to previous studies. The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; this systematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. In addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy, and this review included panel -based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were included. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, th is study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy, Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral palsy; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare- based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years and the health care- based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort (predominantly pediatric), molecular diagnostic yield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort (predominantly adult), it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participan ts and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts. Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for sequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care- based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized tria l incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days). The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 day s (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants \nwere racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that twice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group receive d a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed group at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study, however, showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical \nmanagement and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for criti cally ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretati on of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a lower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined in this study.  \n In a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who \nwere recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequ encing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, \nophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rhe umatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for cases with etiologic noncoding, structural and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for clinical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical outcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Malinowski et al. (2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS. \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy. Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was identified. Ultimately, 167 articles were i ncluded; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly al l included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision- making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by St ark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al. (2016), Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al.  \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Malinowski et al. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 participants that were extensively ph enotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare \ndiseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolomics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of ad ults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately \n6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to  aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020) examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASDs  (n = 4), DD/ID ( n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting. A total of  37 pathogenic /likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals  (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the \nSNVs identified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3%. For the individuals that had positive results, \n36.7% and 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals  \nwith DD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their cohort \ncompared to traditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that t hey also achieved their secondary objectives \nof decreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluations) addressed ES for use in individuals with (NDDs). \nThe study included a meta- analysis and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES \nwith that of CMA in affected individuals. The study defined NDD as global DD, ID and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles \naddressing diagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of \nES was 36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions), which is substantially greater \nthan previous studies focused on CMA (15- 20%). The researchers conclude that the study showed consistently better \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have been less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneous cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing.

(2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 \nyears of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnostic resul t in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionabl e findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score and standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and \nfor the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes. In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) w ere found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome analysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes, however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH -funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none of which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance \nrate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malformations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub- group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early \nintervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome,  type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset  disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and  were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT  and G6PD . Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could impact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines arise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by fact ors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond that currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.   \n In order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was 2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were \nfound, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n As part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield. In some cases, family testing was performed to \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 12 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n determine gene segregation and verify pathogenicity. The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent specialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary spastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n Bardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical \nindications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing for Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes \nwere selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in \n52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platforms or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the involvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.   \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August \n2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta‐ analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utilit y of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of WES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WGS and WES was not significantly different. In studies with in-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference lab interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statisticall y significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnosti c rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be considered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n \nThe diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One B RCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a \nchange in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/601, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non- sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling for variant discussion.  \n \nAnother study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a \ncohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioRe source Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality was poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate varied by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individua ls had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that \nthe WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection rate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 –5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from consan guineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A, PPOX, FRMPD4, and SCN1B, and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a fi rst-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics ’ laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n neurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening  \nA 2023 systematic review and meta- analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Seco ndary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 47%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9- 24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27- 51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time for CMA/WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended.  Publications by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies \nwhere CMA had been negative. Testing took place between the 12th and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded ( n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm). For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence variation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was \n40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS, related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply. The researchers assert that although this \nstudy  is limited by small sample size, the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use.  \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies w ere included in this review, representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled incremental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre- selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases ( 42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these \nresults, the researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a di agnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with \nstructural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending \non the body system impacted and can be increased by specific pre- selection of cases after a  multi- disciplinary review \nindicating likelihood of a monogenic cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies \nthat were evaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of analysis which likely impact diagnostic yield  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of \nprenatal ES to gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritize cases for testing and the challenges that exist for interpreting variants w ith incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding \nphenotype. Publications by  Chen et al.  (2020), Deden et al.  (2020), Lord et al.  (2019), Petrovski  et al.  (2019) , Aarabi  et al.  \n(2018),  Fu et al.  (2018) , and Normand et al.  (2018), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in this systematic \nreview.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 15 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were obtained prior to exome analysis. After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely path ogenic variants were \nidentified that were de termined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progressed. The authors \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogeni c variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta- analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies) with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yield of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these, 42% of variants were \nhomozygous. Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appe ar to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndromes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon.  \n \nA 2020 (updated 2023 ) Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS related to \nimprovement of diagnosis and assistance with pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are \ndetected by ultrasound or other testing is lacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for the use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologi c diseases. Specifically, relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions and deletions and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP). This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals, 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels. Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platform used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals, which, according to their referring clinicians, would ena ble \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to lead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to efficient re analysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n In an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children  \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \nundiagnosed c hildren who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re- evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of better bioinformatic pipelines, improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification of previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact  the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. The study showed that not all afflicted individuals will undergo routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey, \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting and considered all di sease- related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new di agnoses, however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The \nliterature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examined 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two years of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new \ndiagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs. The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n \nAlfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of WES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton \nsystem. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs may  not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the study and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclusive WES results. Most were male (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patien ts \nhad complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS results with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because the data that demonstrated their pathogenicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original \nraw data files were not available from this lab to determin e if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four \nvariants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re- analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n and the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of positives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n \nTo evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis, Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date soft ware and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnosti c exomes. This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 –3-year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of relat ionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround- times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinical utility of these rapid and ult ra-rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra -rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), \ndiscussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gu bbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nDimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed had cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in \nGenomic Medicine and  Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). \nThe goal of the NSIGHT study was to comp are two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two \ninterpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who \nreceived urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra-\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 \nhours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. O f the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, respectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n urWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0.0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \nwere randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, cr itically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to l ess seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of bot h tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with undiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30- 50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. Sanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings outside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n \nClark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a provisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the \nmean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four timed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling took \na median of 1 hour and is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant variants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and \noptimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and l ogical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was selected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospecti vely in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with t wo children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the \nprior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously il l infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 hours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger sequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Whole Transcriptome Sequencing  \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS. The results of RNAseq were combined with gen ome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional seven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels, and SVs were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 samples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7– 27%), bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29 –48%). The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of RNAseq. The study was limited by its small cohort size which underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center, \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional \nstudies on broader populations and focused on improv ement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication. Although it shows early promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, further development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential clinical \nutility.  \n Mantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities in a proof -of-principle study. In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra- high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM. The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not ( n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders ( n = 15), family history of chromosome abnormality ( n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound ( n = \n9). The result was compared to known anomalies obtained via current standard- of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities. They foresee continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- quality clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n \nAdditional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications . (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023)  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified \nthrough routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available. Evidence \nLevel C . (Kang et al., 2015, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 20 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nIn an AANEM 2016 consensus statement, the group stated that while they do not endorse or recommend a specific \ntesting methodology, genetic testing to establish a molecular diagnosis is a crucial step in providing optimal care to \nindividuals with neuromuscular disorders . (Kassardjian et al., 2016, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \nIn a 2021 practice guideline authored by Manickam et al., the ACMG asserts their position that evidenced- based literature \nsupports clinical utility of whole exome and whole genome sequencing on both active and long- term management of \nindividuals with congenital anomalies, developmental delay and intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). Based on their comprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first - or second - tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of standard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0 (Miller et al., 2021b), contained 73 genes and detailed the way that genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list (v3.1); a total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR  (hereditary TTR amyloidosis). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome), bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n Monaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health- care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be obtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n A 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test results. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re- evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory work collaboratively in the testing process.”  \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significance,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the i nterpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole-\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”   \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021) addressing the management of stillbirth indicates that whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023)  Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances (e.g., fetuses with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific  genes of  clinical interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances, WES or WGS  may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG, and Horizon 2020 project Solve- RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases using various analytical techniques. The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, \nefficiency and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed \nin accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal anomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple organ system anomalies ; and \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies ; and \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a fetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline . \n \nThe guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or neurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and \ncomprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)  \nIn a 2022 evidence- based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology. The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing, followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider \nin the context of appropriate pre-  and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n \nThis section is to be used for informational purposes only. FDA approval alone is not a basis for coverage.  \n Laboratories that perform genetic tests are regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Act of 1988.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility .

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered. In particular, a patient who had negative germline BRCA1 and 2\ntesting, who is from a family with no pathogenic variants, should be considered for \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results.

The USPSTF guideline recommended:10\nWhen a woman's personal or family history of cancer is consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family \nhistory of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry \nassociated with breast cancer susceptibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) gene mutations with\nan appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from \nfamilies with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations \nare more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for \nthese specific mutations.\"\nNote  This benefit/harm statement only applies to those jurisdictions that do not have \nMedicare guidance. Based upon the guidelines and evidence provided in the clinical \npolicy, following EviCore's criteria for BRCA analysis will ensure that testing will be \navailable to those members most likely to benefit from a genetic diagnosis. For those \nnot meeting criteria, it ensures alternate diagnostic strategies are considered. \nHowever, it is possible that some members who have the condition, but have non-\nstandard features, will not receive an immediate approval for testing.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nChromosomal microarray analysis may be considered medically necessary  as first-line testing in the initial evaluation (see Policy Guidelines) of\nindividuals with any of the following:\nApparent nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability ,\nAutism spectrum disorder , or\nMultiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\nChromosomal microarray is considered investigational  for the evaluation of all other conditions of delayed development, including, but not limited to,\nidiopathic growth or language delay .\nPanel testing using next-generation sequencing is considered investigational  in all cases of suspected genetic abnormality in children with\ndevelopmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , or congenital anomalies.\n \nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nUse of chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing as outlined in this policy is not intended for use in the prenatal period.\nA guideline update from the American College of Medical Genetics (Schaefer et al [2013]) stated that a stepwise (or tiered) approach to the clinical\ngenetic diagnostic evaluation of autism spectrum disorder is recommended, with the recommendation being for first tier to include fragile X syndrome\nand CMA  testing.\nRecommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics (Manning and Hudgins [2010]) on array-based technologies and their clinical\nutilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities include the following: \"Appropriate follow-up is recommended in cases of chromosome imbalance\nidentified by CMA, to include cytogenetic/FISH [fluorescent in situ hybridization] studies of the patient, parental evaluation, and clinical genetic\nevaluation and counseling.”\nIn some cases of CMA  analysis, the laboratory performing the test confirms all reported copy number variants with an alternative technology , such as\nfluorescent in situ hybridization analysis.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit). As of September 2024 CytoScan HD Array contains 2.67 million markers for copy number , 750,000 SNVs, and 1.9 million\nnon-polymorphic probes.

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

Scientific Background  \nGene  mutations  are referred  to as “germline”  if they  are within gametes  (ova  and sperm) . Therefore,  \nthese  mutations  may  be passed  on from  parent  to offspring.  There  are many  different  types  of germline  \nmutations,  such as single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs),  structural  variations  such  as deletions,  \ninversions,  or translocations,  as well as smaller  chromosomal  abnormalities  such as short  tandem  repeats,  \nor gene  fusions. M utations  may  not necessarily  result  in disease.  \nSNPs  are the most  common  type  of genetic  mutation,  such  as missense  mutations.  These mutations  are \nsingle  base -pair changes  where  one nucleotide  is replaced  with  a different  nucleotide . Millions  of \nindividual  SNPs  have  been  identified  through  genome -wide  association  studies,  with  approximately  4000  \nSNPs  with  potential  association  with  disease . Insertion/deletion  (indel)  polymorphisms  are often  a single  \nnucleotide  but may  be up to four nucleotides.  SNPs  often  lead  to frameshift  mutations,  which  can cause  \npremature  stop  codons  and the failure  of the allele . \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 4 of 10 \nStructural variations  are usually  classified  as larger than  1000 base  pairs. These  include  deletions,  \nduplications,  inversions,  translocations,  or ring chromosome  formation.  Due to the large  number  of bases  \naffected,  these  variations  may  lead  to severe  genetic  abnormalities.  For example,  a major cause  of \nDuchenne  muscular  dystrophy  is the deletion  of large  portions  of exons  (coding  portions  of genes) . The \nmost  common  structural  variation  is the copy  number  variant  (CNV),  which  refers  to differing  amounts  of \nDNA  segments  in different  individuals.  For example,  one person  may  have  three  copies  of a specific  \nsegment  whereas  another  may  only  have  two.  These variations  may  lead  to dysregulation,  gain-of-\nfunction,  or loss-of-function  of the affected  genes.  The sensitive  genes  that require  or produce  precise  \namounts  of a protein  product  tend  to suffer more  from  these  variations. \nGermline  mutations  are unique  in that the risk for certain  conditions , including  many  forms  of cancer , \nmay  be passed  from  parent  to offspring. Testing  for these conditions  will often  involve  testing  entire  \nfamilies  if one member  is found to have  a germline  mutation ; for example,  the National Comprehensive  \nCancer  Network  (NCCN ) guidelines  for hereditary  cancer  recommend  testing  for BRCA 1/2, CDH1,  PALB2,  \nPTEN  and TP53  mutations  if any blood  relative  has a known or likely  pathogenic  variant  in a cancer  \nsusceptibility  gene . Wilson  e t  al. (2020)  estimate  that 21,800 adult  survivors  of childhood  cancer in the \nUnited  States  carry  a pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variant  in one of 156 cancer  predisposition  genes.  \n \nOther  types  of mutations  are unique  to germline  mutations.  Errors  in chromosome  number  (aneuploidy)  \nare typically  caused  by non- disjunctions  in meiosis, causing  either  a monosomic  (one  chromosome)  or a \ntrisomic  (three  chromosomes)  set of chromosomes.  Some  aneuploidies , trisomy  21, or Down  Syndrome , \nbeing  most  notable , are compatible  with  life. Aneuploidies  may  also result  with  sex chromosomes,  \nresulting  in conditions  such as Turner’s  Syndrome  (one  X chromosome)  or Klinefelter’s  Syndrome  (XXY).  \nAny size mutation  may  be pathogenic  and must  be classified  as to how  likely  they  are to cause  disease. \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  (ACMG ) has classified  mutations  in five \ncategories,  which  are as follows:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  uncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and \nbenign.  The “likely  pathogenic”  and “likely  benign”  refer to weaker  evidence  than  their  respective  \npathogenic  and benign categories,  and “uncertain  significance”  refers  to evidence  that does  not meet  \ncriteri a for benignity  or pathogenicity  or has conflicting  evidence  from  both  sides.  Prediction  algorithms  \nhave  been used to interpret  variants  and to predict  whether  a variant  will affect  the gene  function or \nsplicing  of the gene.  These  algorithms  are publicly  available  but have  a tendency  of predicting  harmful \nimpact  of a variant.  The specificity  of these  databases  has been estimated  at 60-80%.  \nDue to t he  enormous  number  of variants,  as well as the rate that variants  are discovered,  comprehensive  \ndatabases  of genetic  variants  have  been published and are easily  available. For example,  the Haplotype  \nReference  Consortium  contains  over  40 million  identified  SNPs . Databases  focusing on cancer -specific  \nvariants,  reference  sequences , and the general  population  are all available  publicly.   \nFor many  years,  single -gene  testing  was the standard  approach  for germline  mutation  testing.  In recent  \nyears,  multigene  panel  testing  (MGPT)  has been introduced and widely  accepted  as the first-tier test.  \nMGPT  increases  the probability  of identifying  pathogenic  mutations  and represents  an affordable  \napplication  of next -generation sequencing  (NGS)  into clinical practice.  However,  the clinical utility  of \nMGPT  is not well established,  especially  in cases  where  more  than  one pathogenic  variant  is identified.  \nThe risk for a specific  malignancy  is complex  and if a gene  panel  discovers  a mutation  incidentally,  \nmanagement  can be difficult.  Many  guidelines  call for radical  procedures  for these  disease  states  and it \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 5 of 10 \nmay  cause  unnecessary  harm  for the patient  concerned  about  predisposition  to the disease.  Additionally,  \na combination  of mutations  may  interact  to alter the profile  of the disease. For instance,  certain  \ncombinations  of mutations  may  be detrimental and increase  the overall  risk of cancer  malignancy,  while  \nother  combinations  may  reduce  overall  risk of malignancy.  In this regard,  identifying  clinically  actionable  \nmutations  may  be unclear  with  MGPT.   \nClinical  Utility  and Validity  \nGenetic  testing  for germline  mutations  “can be conducted  on virtually  any tissue  type, ” although  many  \nlaboratories  prefer blood  samples,  check  swabs  or saliva  samples.  Advancements  in technology  and \navailability  of sequencing,  previously  constrained by limitations  of sequential  single -gene  testing  on \nlimited  patient  samples,  have  led to significant  strides  in the understanding  of the genetic  basis  of \ninherited  and somatic  conditions.   \nVariants  detected  by genetic  testing  include  inherited  germline  variants  and somatic  mutations ; next  \ngeneration  sequencing (NGS)  has allowed  for superior  detection  for these  mutations.  The accuracy  of \nNGS  varies  depending on how  many  genes  are sequenced;  fewer  genes  tend  to result  in higher  accuracy  \nsince  there  will be more  “probe -template  overlap .” Although Sanger  sequencing  remains  the most  \naccurate  at >99.99%  accuracy,  it cannot  sequence  a large  quantity  of genes  in a timely  fashion  and is best  \nused  for sequencing  of a specific  gene.  Pogoda  et al. (2019)  identified  rare variants  in the ATM  gene by \nusing single molecule Molecular Inversion Probes (smMIPSs) , an NGS -based screening method . A total \nof 373 patients with dystonia and six positive controls with previously identified ATM  variants \nparticipated in this study. Results generated by the smMIPs  “produced similar results as routinely used \nNGS -based approaches ” (Pogoda et al., 2019) . This suggests that ATM  screening should be routinely \nused when genetic testing dystonia patients.  Further, smMIPs may be an important technique for the \ngermline screening for all rare neurodegenerative disorders.  \nThe c linical  validity  of a genetic  test depends  primarily  on the expressivity  and penetrance  of a given  \nphenotype.  Penetrance  refers  to the likelihood  of developing  a disease  when the pathogenic  mutation  is \npresent,  and expressivity  refers  to the variations  in the way the disease  is expressed.  For example,  \nvirtually  any mutation  in the APC gene  will cause  symptoms  of familial  adenomatous  polyposis,  thereby  \nincreasing  the clinical  validity  of an APC assessment  while  other  conditions  may  not clinically  manifest  at \nall despite  a mutated  genotype.   \nThe clinical  utility  of a genetic  test generally  relies  on available  treatments  for a condition.  Conditions  \nsuch  as Huntington Disease  that do not have  many  options  for treatment  will have  limited  clinical utility  \ncompared to another  condition  even  though the actual test is highly  valid.  Factors , such  as severity of the \ndisease  and management  options , affect  the clinical  utility  of a genetic  test.   \nLincoln  et al. (2020)  performed  a retrospective study  to investigate the yield  and utility  of germline  \ntesting  on cancer  patients  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing.  The authors  calculated  the prevalence  of \npathogenic  germline  variants  (PVG)  and the potential  actionability  of the PVGs  in 2023  cancer  patients . \n30.5%  (n=617)  of participants  had PVGs . Participants  with  PVGs  spanned  all ages  and cancer  types.  \nTumor  DNA  sequencing missed 8.1%  of PGVs . 11.2%  of missed  PVGs  were  only  detected  after \ndeveloping a second  primary  cancer.  The results  suggest  that missed PVGs  could  have  been  detected  \nearlier and the second  cancer  could  have  been  treated  earlier or prevented.  The authors  concluded  \nthat germline  testing  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing can result  in important  findings  that can impact  \npatient  care.  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 6 of 10 \nVI. Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular \nPathology  (AMP)   \nThe ACMG and AMP released criteria on the types and severity of mutations, which are as follows:  \n• Very strong evidence of pathogenicity : Null variants (nonsense, frameshifts, canonical +/ - 1-2 splice \nsites, initiation codon, exon deletions) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease. The guidelines note to use caution in genes where LOF is not a mechanism, if L OF variants \nare at the 3’ end, if exon skipping occurs, and if multiple transcripts are present.  \n• Strong: Amino acid change to a pathogenic version, de novo mutations, established studies \nsupporting a damaging gene or gene product, or if the prevalence of the variant is increased in affected individuals compared to healthy controls. The guidelines note to be careful of changes \nimpacting splicing and if only the paternity has been confirmed.  \n• Moderate: Located in a mutational hot spot or well- established functional domain (e.g., active site \nof an enzyme) without a benign variation, absent from controls in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium, detected in trans  with pathogenic variants for \na recessive disorder, protein length changes, novel missense changes where a different missense \nchange has been pathogenic before, and a possible de novo mutation.  \n• Supporting: Co -segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively \nknown to cause the disease, missense variant in a gene with low rate of benign missense variation, \nif the mutation has evidence that it is deleterious, or if the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for \ndisease with a single genetic cause.  \nThe guidelines also list criteria for benign gene variants.  \n• Stand- alone evidence of benignity: Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 \nGenomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium  \n• Strong: Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder, observed in healthy adult with full \npenetrance at early age, lack of segregation in affected family members (although pathogenic variants may masquerade as nonsegregated), or well -established studies that show no damaging \neffect on protein production.  \n• Supporting: Missense variant of a gene for which truncating mutations are pathogenic, indels in \nrepetitive region of unknown function, silent variants, variants of unknown significance, or a trans  \nversion of a cis mutation.  \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN)   \nMultiple germline  mutations have been incorporated into the diagnostic workups recommended by the \nNCCN. Furthermore, the NCCN has several guidelines which recommend that gene expression profiling, or multiple gene testing, may be helpful, more efficient and/or cost -effecti ve for selected patients. \nPlease see the individual policies.  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology  (AMP) , American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) , and College \nof American Pathologists ( CAP)  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 7 of 10 \nThe Joint Commission noted that germline variants should focus on the pathogenicity of a given variant \nrather than their impact on clinical care. The guidelines recommend reporting germline variants with known clinical impact , such as BRCA1  or 2. A genetic counseling recommendation should also be \nprovided if a pathogenic germline mutation is found.  \nThe guidelines note that it is critical to identify a somatic vs a germline mutation as the type of mutation \nmay have significant clinical consequences . \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology  (ASCO)   \nThe ASCO published guidelines regarding genetic and genomic testing for cancer susceptibility. These guidelines state that  the “ASCO recognizes that concurrent multigene testing (ie, panel testing) may be \nefficient in circumstances that require evaluation of multiple high -penetrance genes of established \nclinical utility as possible explanations for a patient’s personal or family history of cancer. Depending on the specific genes included on the panel employed, panel testing may also identify mutations in genes associat ed with moderate or low cancer risks and mutations in high -penetrance genes that would not \nhave been evaluated on  the basis of the presenting personal or family history… ASCO affirms that it is \nsufficient for cancer risk assessment to evaluate genes of established clinical utility that are suggested by the patient’s personal and/or family history .” \nASCO released guidelines regarding germline testing for ovarian  cancer. ASCO recommends that “ all \nwomen diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer should be offered germline genetic testing for BRCA1, \nBRCA2 , and other ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, irrespective of their clinical features or family \ncancer history. In addition, “first - or second -degree blood relatives of a patient with ovarian cancer with \na known germline pathogenic cancer susceptibility  gene mutation or variant should be offered \nindividualized genetic risk evaluation, counseling, and genetic testing.” Lastly, “ clinical decisions should \nnot be based on a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).” In this case, the patient’s clinical features and family history should be taken into consideration and should inform clinical decision making.  \nVII.

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered.

Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant. In addition, there are potential harms related to stigmatization and discrimination. See policy 2.04.128 regarding testing of BRCA1 , BRCA2,\nand PALB2  for Fanconi anemia. See policies 2.04.148, 2.04.151, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156 regarding genetic testing to guide targeted therapy .\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine T umors\nCurrent NCCN guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( v .2.2024) refers to the NCCN guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk assessment of breast,\novarian, and pancreatic cancers detailed above, and state: \"The panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer\nand in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for inherited susceptibility .\" The panel recommends \"using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary\ncancer syndromes.\"89,\nThe NCCN guidelines for genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers ( v .3.2024) states that germline testing is\nclinically indicated for individuals with neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers per the NCCN guidelines on neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors.90, The\nNCCN guidelines for neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors ( v .1.2024) states, \"consider genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing: In a patient with\nduodenal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at any age\", noting, \"studies of unselected patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have identified\ngermline variants in 16%-17% of cases. However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result\non the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).

sequence (e.g., updated knowledge or unrelated condition/syndrome)  \nCPT® is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association  \n \nDescription of Services  \n \nGenetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) or Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in order to inform persons being tested about the advantages and limitations of the test as applied to their unique \nsituation.  \n WES refers to the sequence determination of the exome. The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that \nencodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome.  (Chung, 2023)  \n \nMost known disease- causing variants are found in the exons, and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient \nanalysis can be completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016) . WES results in long lists \nof genetic variants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify \ndisease causing mutations . (Richards et al., 2015)  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome.  (MedlinePlus , 2020b) . This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions , and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023).  As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and  focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years . \n(Taber et al., 2015)  \n Another type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid (RNA). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transc ribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the \ncollective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA present in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology indications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM), uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at spec ific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications (Mantere et al., 2021). OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n Chung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases. The meta-analysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations over a period of 10 years (2011- 2021). Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility (defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes t o clinical management following a diagnosis by ES or GS), \nrates of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from ES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies and evaluated. The analysi s revealed comparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36- 0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall, and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35- 0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I\n2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%). Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES (2- 579 for GS vs 1- 75 for ES), but the rate of VUS was not significantly different ( p = .78). Of the \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n nine studies (2,269 probands) that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times greater than ES \n(95% CI 0.79- 1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With respect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results. Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% - 16%. A signific ant difference in the diagn ostic rate between ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2,361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40- 0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta-\nanalysis. Additionally, of ten QUADAS -2 assessed, high- quality studies (2,170 probands) reporting on clinical utility, GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30- 0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant published literature. Twenty studies, including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES  and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA, met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was potential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta- regression. Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of  the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%), and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals with short stature and provide a strong base of reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes, which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals.  \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS, for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies su pporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals with this disorder. Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of individuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023)  Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES  or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low - quality evidence was found for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified. Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis. Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately 37 art icles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affected famil y members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unexplained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by  Ewans  et al.  (2018) and Bowling  et al.  (2017), previously discussed  in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used in 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \nwere epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secon dary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS was performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year, and for those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undiagnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use of genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD. The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay (DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for this study, which took pl ace in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. They found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine experienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to \nhigh diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s participants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid- 2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative included COL2A1  (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies ( n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2- 22%). For WGS, outcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes; Hayes notes that additional studies evaluating both larger numbers and a broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n \nAn additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did does not address ID in individuals  with other disorders including NDD or global DD, which are discussed in separate Hayes reports. No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies and subtypes of NDD, Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing (NGS) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel sequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and \n28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was \nnot statically significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p =  .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found in this review compared to previous studies. The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; this systematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. In addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy, and this review included panel -based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were included. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, th is study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy, Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral palsy; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare- based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years and the health care- based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort (predominantly pediatric), molecular diagnostic yield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort (predominantly adult), it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participan ts and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts. Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for sequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care- based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized tria l incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days). The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 day s (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants \nwere racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that twice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group receive d a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed group at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study, however, showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical \nmanagement and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for criti cally ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretati on of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a lower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined in this study.  \n In a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who \nwere recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequ encing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, \nophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rhe umatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for cases with etiologic noncoding, structural and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for clinical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical outcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Malinowski et al. (2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS. \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy. Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was identified. Ultimately, 167 articles were i ncluded; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly al l included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision- making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by St ark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al. (2016), Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al.  \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Malinowski et al. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 participants that were extensively ph enotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare \ndiseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolomics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of ad ults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately \n6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to  aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020) examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASDs  (n = 4), DD/ID ( n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting. A total of  37 pathogenic /likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals  (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the \nSNVs identified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3%. For the individuals that had positive results, \n36.7% and 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals  \nwith DD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their cohort \ncompared to traditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that t hey also achieved their secondary objectives \nof decreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluations) addressed ES for use in individuals with (NDDs). \nThe study included a meta- analysis and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES \nwith that of CMA in affected individuals. The study defined NDD as global DD, ID and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles \naddressing diagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of \nES was 36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions), which is substantially greater \nthan previous studies focused on CMA (15- 20%). The researchers conclude that the study showed consistently better \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have been less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneous cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing. Publications by  Vissers et al.  (2017), Tarailo- Graovac  et al.  (2016), Retterer  et al.  \n(2016) , and Lee  et al.  (2014), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in the Srivastava systematic review and \nmeta- analysis.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 11 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Groopman et al. (2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 \nyears of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnostic resul t in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionabl e findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score and standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and \nfor the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes. In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) w ere found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome analysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes, however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH -funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none of which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance \nrate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malformations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub- group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early \nintervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome,  type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset  disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and  were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT  and G6PD . Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could impact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines arise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by fact ors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond that currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.   \n In order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was 2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were \nfound, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n As part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield.

The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent specialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary spastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n Bardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical \nindications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing for Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes \nwere selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in \n52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platforms or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the involvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.   \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August \n2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta‐ analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utilit y of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of WES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WGS and WES was not significantly different. In studies with in-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference lab interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statisticall y significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnosti c rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be considered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n \nThe diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One B RCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a \nchange in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/601, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non- sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling for variant discussion.  \n \nAnother study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a \ncohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioRe source Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality was poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate varied by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individua ls had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that \nthe WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection rate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 –5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from consan guineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A, PPOX, FRMPD4, and SCN1B, and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a fi rst-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics ’ laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n neurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening  \nA 2023 systematic review and meta- analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Seco ndary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 47%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9- 24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27- 51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time for CMA/WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended.  Publications by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies \nwhere CMA had been negative. Testing took place between the 12th and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded ( n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm). For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence variation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was \n40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS, related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply. The researchers assert that although this \nstudy  is limited by small sample size, the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use.  \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies w ere included in this review, representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled incremental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre- selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases ( 42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these \nresults, the researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a di agnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with \nstructural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending \non the body system impacted and can be increased by specific pre- selection of cases after a  multi- disciplinary review \nindicating likelihood of a monogenic cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies \nthat were evaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of analysis which likely impact diagnostic yield  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of \nprenatal ES to gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritize cases for testing and the challenges that exist for interpreting variants w ith incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding \nphenotype. Publications by  Chen et al.  (2020), Deden et al.  (2020), Lord et al.  (2019), Petrovski  et al.  (2019) , Aarabi  et al.  \n(2018),  Fu et al.  (2018) , and Normand et al.  (2018), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in this systematic \nreview.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 15 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were obtained prior to exome analysis. After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely path ogenic variants were \nidentified that were de termined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progressed. The authors \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogeni c variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta- analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies) with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yield of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these, 42% of variants were \nhomozygous. Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appe ar to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndromes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon.  \n \nA 2020 (updated 2023 ) Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS related to \nimprovement of diagnosis and assistance with pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are \ndetected by ultrasound or other testing is lacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for the use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologi c diseases. Specifically, relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions and deletions and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP). This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals, 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels. Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platform used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals, which, according to their referring clinicians, would ena ble \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to lead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to efficient re analysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n In an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children  \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \nundiagnosed c hildren who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re- evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of better bioinformatic pipelines, improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification of previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact  the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. The study showed that not all afflicted individuals will undergo routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey, \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting and considered all di sease- related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new di agnoses, however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The \nliterature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examined 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two years of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new \ndiagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs. The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n \nAlfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of WES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton \nsystem. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs may  not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the study and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclusive WES results. Most were male (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patien ts \nhad complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS results with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because the data that demonstrated their pathogenicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original \nraw data files were not available from this lab to determin e if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four \nvariants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re- analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n and the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of positives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n \nTo evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis, Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date soft ware and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnosti c exomes. This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 –3-year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of relat ionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround- times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinical utility of these rapid and ult ra-rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra -rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), \ndiscussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gu bbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nDimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed had cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in \nGenomic Medicine and  Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). \nThe goal of the NSIGHT study was to comp are two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two \ninterpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who \nreceived urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra-\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 \nhours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. O f the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, respectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n urWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0.0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \nwere randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, cr itically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to l ess seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of bot h tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with undiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30- 50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. Sanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings outside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n \nClark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a provisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the \nmean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four timed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling took \na median of 1 hour and is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant variants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and \noptimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and l ogical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was selected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospecti vely in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with t wo children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the \nprior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously il l infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 hours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger sequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Whole Transcriptome Sequencing  \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS. The results of RNAseq were combined with gen ome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional seven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels, and SVs were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 samples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7– 27%), bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29 –48%). The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of RNAseq. The study was limited by its small cohort size which underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center, \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional \nstudies on broader populations and focused on improv ement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication. Although it shows early promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, further development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential clinical \nutility.  \n Mantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities in a proof -of-principle study. In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra- high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM. The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not ( n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders ( n = 15), family history of chromosome abnormality ( n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound ( n = \n9). The result was compared to known anomalies obtained via current standard- of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities. They foresee continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- quality clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n \nAdditional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications . (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023)  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified \nthrough routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available. Evidence \nLevel C . (Kang et al., 2015, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 20 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nIn an AANEM 2016 consensus statement, the group stated that while they do not endorse or recommend a specific \ntesting methodology, genetic testing to establish a molecular diagnosis is a crucial step in providing optimal care to \nindividuals with neuromuscular disorders . (Kassardjian et al., 2016, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \nIn a 2021 practice guideline authored by Manickam et al., the ACMG asserts their position that evidenced- based literature \nsupports clinical utility of whole exome and whole genome sequencing on both active and long- term management of \nindividuals with congenital anomalies, developmental delay and intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). Based on their comprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first - or second - tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of standard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0 (Miller et al., 2021b), contained 73 genes and detailed the way that genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list (v3.1); a total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR  (hereditary TTR amyloidosis). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome), bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n Monaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health- care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be obtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n A 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test results. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re- evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory work collaboratively in the testing process.”  \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significance,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the i nterpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole-\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”   \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021) addressing the management of stillbirth indicates that whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023)  Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances (e.g., fetuses with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific  genes of  clinical interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances, WES or WGS  may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG, and Horizon 2020 project Solve- RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases using various analytical techniques. The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, \nefficiency and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed \nin accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal anomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple organ system anomalies ; and \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies ; and \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a fetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline . \n \nThe guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or neurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and \ncomprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)  \nIn a 2022 evidence- based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology. The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing, followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider \nin the context of appropriate pre-  and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n \nThis section is to be used for informational purposes only.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Seizure \ntypes include generalized seizures (absence seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic \nseizures), focal seizures (simple focal seizures, complex focal seizures, secondary \ngeneralized seizures, among others), and seizures for which the type is unknown. \nEpilepsy syndromes can be associated with generalized, focal, or combined \ngeneralized and focal seizures, and can have onset in childhood or adulthood.2 \nEpilepsy syndromes may be associated with developmental and/or epileptic \nencephalopathy (childhood onset) or progressive neurological deterioration (later \nonset).2 \nCause \nEpilepsy has multiple causes, including central nervous system infection, autoimmune \ndisease, structural brain abnormalities, brain tumors, and head trauma.3 There are also\nnumerous genetic conditions associated with epilepsy. It is estimated that \napproximately 40% of individuals with seizures have an underlying genetic basis for \ntheir condition (see Table 1 for a list of common genetic causes).4 Factors that \ncontribute to the likelihood of a genetic basis includes type of seizures (focal or \ngeneralized) or epilepsy syndromes (such as epileptic encephalopathy), age of onset, \nfamily history, and presence of other clinical features.\nThrough Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based testing, including multi-gene \npanels, whole exome and genome sequencing as well as whole-genome screening for \nCNVs, pathogenic sequence variants have been identified in about 30-40% and \ndeletions or duplications in ~5-10% of patients with a range of epilepsy phenotypes, \nincluding focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsies, epileptic encephalopathies, fever-\nassociated epilepsy syndromes, other epilepsy syndromes, and patients with \nneurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.5,6 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 11 of 20\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Epilepsy                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nThere are many different epilepsy syndromes, including generalized epilepsy \nsyndromes, focal epilepsy syndromes, combined generalized and focal epilepsy \nsyndromes, epilepsy syndromes with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy \n(DEE). These syndromes can present at variable ages ranging from neonatal to \nadulthood.2,7 \nDEE is a group of disorders in which seizures are accompanied by developmental \ndelays, cognitive impairment, or a host of other neurological issues such as feeding \ndifficulties, sleep dysregulation, and behavioral problems.8 Knowledge regarding the \ngenetic basis of these disorders has increased significantly in the last decade due to \nthe advent of high throughput NGS methods, resulting in wider availability of multi-gene\npanel testing. The following are examples of epileptic encephalopathies:\nOhtahara Syndrome (Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy)\no“Characterized by early onset intractable tonic spasms, suppression-burst \npattern on interictal EEG, and poor prognosis.”  9 \no“To date various genes, which have essential roles in the brain’s neuronal and \ninterneuronal functions, have been reported to be associated with Ohtahara \nsyndrome. For instance, syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) regulates synaptic\nvesicle release; aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) acts as a regulator of \nproliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors; solute carrier family 25 \nmember 22 (SLC25A22) encodes a mitochondrial glutamate transporter13; and \npotassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 2 (KCNQ2) plays\na key role in a cell’s ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.”  10 \nDravet Syndrome (Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy)\no“Clinical cardinal features include febrile or afebrile generalized or \nhemiconvulsions starting in the first year of life, seizure evolution to a mixture of \nintractable generalized (myoclonic or atonic seizures, atypical absences) and \nfocal seizures, normal early development, subsequent psychomotor retardation, \nand normal brain imaging at onset.”  9 \no“In most of the cases with Dravet syndrome, one single gene has been involved,\nin contrast to other epileptic encephalopathy syndromes.

Seizure, cognitive, and \npsychiatric phenotypes show heterogeneity. Seizures start from the age of 6 to \n36 months and may be precipitated by fever. Seizure types include GTCS, \nmyoclonic and tonic seizures, absences, and focal.”  9 \no“Different mutations of PCDH19 (protocadherin 19), including missense, \nnonsense, and frameshift mutations, have been reported as the cause of \nEFMR.” 9 \nInheritance \nInheritance patterns differ between various epilepsy syndromes, and include \nmonogenic inheritance patterns such as dominant, X-linked, recessive, and \nmitochondrial, in addition to epilepsy caused by de novo (i.e. new) genetic mutations. \nClinical heterogeneity is also seen in these conditions.\nDiagnosis \nAn electroencephalograph (EEG) can be used to help diagnose epilepsy and possibly \ngive information as to the seizure type. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \nscan can further help define whether epilepsy is caused by a structural brain \nabnormality or help determine the origin of epilepsy. \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is complicated by many factors. Epilepsy syndromes \nfrequently have overlapping features, such as the types of seizures involved and/or \nadditional clinical findings. Many (if not most) epilepsy syndromes, including epileptic \nencephalopathy, are genetically heterogeneous, and can be caused by mutations in a \nnumber of different genes. Sometimes, the inheritance pattern or the presence of \npathognomonic features makes the underlying syndrome clear. However, in many \ncases, it can be difficult to reliably diagnose a genetic epilepsy syndrome based on \nclinical and family history alone.\nNGS-based testing has been shown to dramatically improve the diagnostic rate for \nchildren and adults with epilepsy, as well as significantly shorten the time from \nassessment to diagnosis.11-13 The diagnostic yield of NGS in patients with epilepsy is \nestimated to be 20-40%.6,14,15 \nClinical information (e.g. age of onset, seizure type, EEG results, etc.) or family history \nmay be used in some cases to help narrow down the suspected cause.

Not all \ntreatments will work for everyone and often, it takes multiple treatment trials to find a \nregimen that is successful. Refractory epilepsy is diagnosed after two or more AEDs \nhave failed to control seizures. Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined as \"failure of \nadequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules \n(whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom\".16\nIn a rapidly growing number of epilepsy disorders, knowing the genetic mutation that is \nresponsible for the epilepsy has been shown to help guide management and provide \nmore disease-specific treatment.17,18 \nSurvival \nLifespan is dependent upon seizure control and the underlying cause of the individual's\nepilepsy.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nGenetic testing for epilepsy may consist of next-generation sequencing or multigene \npanels.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nMulti-Gene Testing Panels \nThe efficiency of NGS has led to an increasing number of large, multi-gene testing \npanels. NGS panels that test several genes at once are particularly well-suited to \nconditions caused by more than one gene or where there is considerable clinical \noverlap between conditions making it difficult to reliably narrow down likely causes. \nAdditionally, tests should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of identifying mutations \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

In this age period, the diagnostic yield of \ngenetic testing may reach up to 60%. However, age at testing (as opposed to the \nage at onset of epilepsy) should not influence the decision to test or the type of test \nchosen. Individuals who are now adults who had early-onset epilepsy likely \npresented in the era before genetic testing was widely available, and should be \nconsidered candidates for testing.\" \n\"Clinical utility of genetic testing is highest in the more severe, drug-resistant \nepilepsies . Overall, the most obvious indication, in terms of clinical utility and \ndiagnostic yield, is for people with early-onset DEE or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders with epilepsy.

We conditionally recommend ES/GS over MGP as the first-tier test.\"\n\"The MGP panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and include copy number \nanalysis.\"\n\"MGPs are valuable clinical tools that can be employed in a number of clinical \nscenarios, for example, when an individual presents with a defined epilepsy \nsyndrome for which a subset of genes should be interrogated more robustly than \nthrough ES when GS is unavailable. Additionally, if urgent results are required and \nrapid ES/GS is unavailable, a targeted MGP may be considered. MGPs may also \nbe utilized as a first-tier test when access to ES/GS, or the additional genetic \ncounseling required to implement such testing, may be limited.\"\nSelected Relevant Publications \nPeer reviewed and expert authored articles are presented below. \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic testing for epileptic encephalopathy \nstated the following: \no“Second line investigations: Targeted next generation sequencing panels of \nepileptic encephalopathy genes for individuals with epileptic encephalopathy.”  8 \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic causes of early-onset epileptic \nencephalopathy stated the following:10 \no“Molecular-based studies on early-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be \nperformed, necessitating programmed genetical algorithms. If the phenotype \ncould be determined with clinical findings, specific gene testing would be helpful \nin diagnosis. However, if the phenotype could not be determined because of \noverlapping phenotypes of different syndromes and the spectrum of phenotypes\nseen in different mutations, the use of gene panels for epilepsy would increase \nthe probability of correct diagnosis. In a recent study, the rate of diagnosis with \ntargeted single gene sequencing has been reported as 15.4%, whereas the rate\nhas increased to 46.2% with the utility of epilepsy gene panels.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

It is a heterogeneous condition that encompasses many types of seizures and varies in\nage of onset and severity . Many genetic epilepsies are thought to have a complex, multifactorial genetic basis. There are also numerous rare epileptic\nsyndromes associated with global developmental delay and/or cognitive impairment that occur in infancy or early childhood, and that may be caused\nby a single-gene pathogenic variant . Genetic testing is commercially available for a large number of genes that may be related to epilepsy .\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether genetic testing improves the net health outcome in individuals with infantile- or early-\nchildhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy or with presumed genetic epilepsy .\n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nGenetic testing for genes associated with infantile- and early-childhood onset epilepsy syndromes in individuals with infantile- and early-childhood-\nonset epilepsy syndromes in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (see Policy Guidelines section) may be considered medically necessary  if\npositive test results may:\nLead to changes in medication management; AND/OR\nLead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests are avoided ; AND/OR\nLead to changes in reproductive decision making.\nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other situations.\nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nPolicy Scope\nIncluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that might have a genetic etiology . In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as\nhaving underlying genetic cause or etiology when, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic defect and\nseizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or metabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy . The updated 2017 ILAE\nclassification system does not discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause.\nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom ( eg,\nDravet syndrome, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy , generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and intellectual disability limited to\nfemales, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy). Other clinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes  but are generally  secondary to epilepsy\nitself.\nExcluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of symptomatology , of which seizures may be one, such as the\nneurocutaneous disorders ( eg, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral malformations or abnormal\ncortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. Genetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed  in other evidence\nreviews (see Related Policies links).\nTesting that is limited to genotyping of cytochrome P450 ( CYP450)  genes is addressed  separately (evidence review 2.04.38).\nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry prior to  considering drug treatment\nwith carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nlabeling for carbamazepine.\nThis policy also does not address the testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA  polymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically\nsuspected mitochondrial disorders prior to  initiation of therapy with valproate. V alproate\"s label contains a black box warning related to increased risk of\nacute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients with POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA  labeling states\nthat valproate \" is contraindicated  in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under 2 years of age who\nare clinically suspected  of having a POLG-related disorder”.\nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and T esting Strategy\nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, are severe, and are characterized by\nepilepsy as the primary manifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League Against\nEpilepsy , these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndromes associated with a high probability of encephalopathic features\nthat present or worsen after the onset of epilepsy . Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or  intellectual disability , may be\npresent secondary to the epilepsy  itself. Specific clinical syndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include:FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers.

There is a challenge in defining the population appropriate for testing given that specific epileptic\nsyndromes may be associated  with dif ferent EEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe seizures prior to\nthe onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However , for this policy , the medically necessary policy statement would apply for\npatients with :\nOnset of seizures in early childhood (ie, before the age of 5 years); AND\nClinically severe seizures that af fect daily functioning and/or  interictal EEG abnormalities; AND\nNo other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient\"s symptoms.\n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nTesting Strategy\nThere is clinical and genetic overlap for many of the electroclinical syndromes previously discussed. If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based\non history , EEG findings, and other test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most likely to be involved,\nfollowed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular , if an SCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+),\nmolecular genetic testing of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by deletion and duplication analysis if a pathogenic\nvariant is not identified , should be obtained.\nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses a multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In\nthese cases, panels should meet the criteria outlined in evidence review 2.04.92 (general approach to evaluating the utility of genetic panels). Criteria\nfor use of  whole exome sequencing are outlined  in evidence review 2.04.102 (whole exome and whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of genetic\ndisorders).\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (T able PG2). The Society\"s\nnomenclature is recommended  by the Human V ariome Project, the Human  Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology<97>\"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign”<97>to describe\nvariants identified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG2.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nGenetic Counseling\nGenetic counseling is primarily aimed at patients who are at risk for inherited disorders, and experts recommend formal genetic counseling in most\ncases when genetic testing for an inherited condition is considered. The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\nFDA REGULA TORY STATUS\nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the\ngeneral regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are\navailable under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity testing.\nTo date, the FDA  has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who receive testing for genes associated with epileptic\nencephalopathies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For Dravet syndrome, which\nappears to have the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-associated variants is high (up to 80%). For other\nearly-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true clinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However , studies reporting on the\noverall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy have reported detection rates for clinically significant\nvariants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The clinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known pathogenic variant.\nThe presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication management, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive\nplanning. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants associated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes\nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test validity , changes in reproductive decision making,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For most genetic epilepsies, which\nare thought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic variants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a\nlarge body of literature on associations between genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly understood. Published\nliterature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which have not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of\nstudies have also reported associations between genetic variants and antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment response, AED adverse ef fect risk, epilepsy\nphenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The largest number of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics,\nwhich has generally reported some association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , EPHX1 , CYP2C9 ,\nCYP2C19 ) and AED response. Similarly , genetic associations between a number of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported.\nHowever , no empirical evidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the changes in clinical management that\nmight occur as a result of testing are not well-defined. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

With regard to  whether genetic testing should be routinely ordered  for\nchildren with status epilepticus, the guidelines stated: \"There is insuf ficient evidence to support or refute whether such studies should be done\nroutinely .”\nIn 2000, the American Academy of Neurology , Child Neurology Society , and the American Epilepsy Society published joint guidelines for evaluating a\nfirst nonfebrile seizure in children.87, This guidance was reviewed and reaf firmed in 2023. Routine electroencephalography was recommended  as part\nof the diagnostic evaluation; genetic testing was not addressed .\nInternational League Against Epilepsy\nIn 2015, the International League Against Epilepsy issued a report with recommendations on the management of infantile seizures, which included the\nfollowing related to genetic testing in epilepsy41,:\n\"Genetic screening should not be undertaken at a primary or secondary level of care, as the screening to identify those in need of specific\ngenetic analysis is based  on tertiary settings.”\n\"Standard care should permit genetic counseling by trained personnel to be undertaken at all levels of care (primary to quaternary).”\n\"Genetic evaluation for Dravet syndrome and other infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be available at tertiary and quaternary\nlevels of care (optimal intervention would permit an extended genetic evaluation).”\n\"Early diagnosis of some mitochondrial conditions may alter long-term  outcome, but whether screening at quaternary level is beneficial is\nunknown.”\nNational Society of Genetic Counselors\nIn 2022, the National Society of Genetic Counselors published a practice guideline on genetic testing and counseling for unexplained epilepsies.88,The\nSociety made the following relevant recommendations:\n\"We strongly recommend that individ uals with unexplained epilepsy be of fered genetic testing,  without limitation of age.\nWe strongly recommend comprehensive, multi- gene  testing, such as exome/ge nome sequencing  or multi- gene panel  as a first- tier test.\nWe conditionally recommend exome/ge nome sequencing  over multi- gene panel  as the first- tier test.\nThe multi-gene panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and  include copy number analysis.\"\n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nEuropean Academy of Neurology\nIn 2010, the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now the European Academy of Neurology) issued guidelines on the molecular diagnosis\nof channelopathies, epilepsies, migraine, stroke, and dementias.89, The guidelines made the following recommendations on epilepsy:\n\"There is good evidence to suggest that a thorough clinical and electrophysiological investigation may lead to the choice of the gene to be tested in\npatients with periodic paralysis (Level B). In myotonic disorders, it is recommended to first search for myotonic dystrophy and use clinical and\nelectrophysiological phenotype characterization to guide for molecular genetic testing (Level B).\nMolecular investigations are possible and may help in some cases to diagnose the condition but cannot be considered  as a routine procedure with\nregard to  the large  number of dif ferent mutations [variants] in dif ferent genes. Furthermore, diagnosis can be made more easily by clinical and\nphysiological investigation (Good Practice Point). One exception of note is the diagnosis of SMEI , in which mutations [variants] are found  in SCN1A  in\n80% of the patients (Level B).”\nNorth American Consensus Panel\nIn 2017, recommendations were published from a consensus panel of 14 physicians and 5 family members/caregivers of patients with Dravet\nsyndrome.90, There was strong consensus among panel members that genetic testing should be completed in all patients with clinical suspicion for\nDravet syndrome since this can lead to earlier diagnosis. Options for testing include SCN1A  sequencing followed by testing for deletions and\nduplications if sequencing is negative, or epilepsy gene panel testing, with no consensus among panel members about which option is superior . There\nwas strong consensus that epilepsy gene panel testing is preferred to SCN1A  testing if the clinical presentation is less clear or if the patient has\natypical features, and that karyotyping is not needed. The panel did not reach consensus about the utility of chromosomal microarray in patients with\nsuspected Dravet syndrome (72.2% agreed, 22.2% disagreed, 5.6% did not know) and concluded that this test can be considered. Based on strong\nconsensus, the panel recommended genetic testing in the following circumstances among children with normal development, seizures of unknown\netiology , and no evidence of causal lesion in the brain: infants with at least 2 prolonged focal febrile seizures, or children aged 1 to 3 years with at least\none prolonged febrile seizure before 18 months of age or myoclonic or atypical absence seizures that are refractory to at least one antiepileptic\nmedication. Infants who experience a single prolonged focal or generalized convulsion do not require genetic testing (strong consensus), but this can\nbe considered in children aged 1 to 3 years who experience multiple brief episodes of febrile seizure activity before 18 months of age or myoclonic or\natypical absence seizures that do not respond to antiepileptic medication (moderate consensus). The panel had moderate consensus about the role of\ngenetic testing (epilepsy gene panel) in teens and adults without congenital dysmorphism who have seizure activity resistant to antiepileptic medication\nand lack an early life history .\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for determining hereditary breast and\novarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy . Testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all\nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years, may be indicated for\nguiding cancer therapies. Genetic testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in breast cancer-, pancreatic cancer-, prostate cancer-, or ovarian cancer-\naffected individuals who are considering systemic therapy is addressed separately in evidence reviews 2.04.151, 2.04.148, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156,\nrespectively . Genetic testing for PALB2  variants in pancreatic cancer-af fected individuals is also addressed in 2.04.148. Additionally , conflicting criteria\nreflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited or no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of\ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.\nCurrent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation. W omen with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should\nreceive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant. In addition, there are potential harms related to stigmatization and discrimination. See policy 2.04.128 regarding testing of BRCA1 , BRCA2,\nand PALB2  for Fanconi anemia. See policies 2.04.148, 2.04.151, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156 regarding genetic testing to guide targeted therapy .\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine T umors\nCurrent NCCN guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( v .2.2024) refers to the NCCN guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk assessment of breast,\novarian, and pancreatic cancers detailed above, and state: \"The panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer\nand in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for inherited susceptibility .\" The panel recommends \"using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary\ncancer syndromes.\"89,\nThe NCCN guidelines for genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers ( v .3.2024) states that germline testing is\nclinically indicated for individuals with neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers per the NCCN guidelines on neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors.90, The\nNCCN guidelines for neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors ( v .1.2024) states, \"consider genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing: In a patient with\nduodenal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at any age\", noting, \"studies of unselected patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have identified\ngermline variants in 16%-17% of cases. However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result\non the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

It is a heterogeneous condition that encompasses many types of seizures and varies in\nage of onset and severity . Many genetic epilepsies are thought to have a complex, multifactorial genetic basis. There are also numerous rare epileptic\nsyndromes associated with global developmental delay and/or cognitive impairment that occur in infancy or early childhood, and that may be caused\nby a single-gene pathogenic variant . Genetic testing is commercially available for a large number of genes that may be related to epilepsy .\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether genetic testing improves the net health outcome in individuals with infantile- or early-\nchildhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy or with presumed genetic epilepsy .\n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nGenetic testing for genes associated with infantile- and early-childhood onset epilepsy syndromes in individuals with infantile- and early-childhood-\nonset epilepsy syndromes in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (see Policy Guidelines section) may be considered medically necessary  if\npositive test results may:\nLead to changes in medication management; AND/OR\nLead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests are avoided ; AND/OR\nLead to changes in reproductive decision making.\nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other situations.\nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nPolicy Scope\nIncluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that might have a genetic etiology . In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as\nhaving underlying genetic cause or etiology when, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic defect and\nseizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or metabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy . The updated 2017 ILAE\nclassification system does not discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause.\nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom ( eg,\nDravet syndrome, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy , generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and intellectual disability limited to\nfemales, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy). Other clinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes  but are generally  secondary to epilepsy\nitself.\nExcluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of symptomatology , of which seizures may be one, such as the\nneurocutaneous disorders ( eg, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral malformations or abnormal\ncortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. Genetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed  in other evidence\nreviews (see Related Policies links).\nTesting that is limited to genotyping of cytochrome P450 ( CYP450)  genes is addressed  separately (evidence review 2.04.38).\nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry prior to  considering drug treatment\nwith carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nlabeling for carbamazepine.\nThis policy also does not address the testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA  polymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically\nsuspected mitochondrial disorders prior to  initiation of therapy with valproate. V alproate\"s label contains a black box warning related to increased risk of\nacute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients with POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA  labeling states\nthat valproate \" is contraindicated  in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under 2 years of age who\nare clinically suspected  of having a POLG-related disorder”.\nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and T esting Strategy\nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, are severe, and are characterized by\nepilepsy as the primary manifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League Against\nEpilepsy , these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndromes associated with a high probability of encephalopathic features\nthat present or worsen after the onset of epilepsy . Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or  intellectual disability , may be\npresent secondary to the epilepsy  itself. Specific clinical syndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include:FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers.

Some of them are summarized  in Table PG1.\nTable PG1.

There is a challenge in defining the population appropriate for testing given that specific epileptic\nsyndromes may be associated  with dif ferent EEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe seizures prior to\nthe onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However , for this policy , the medically necessary policy statement would apply for\npatients with :\nOnset of seizures in early childhood (ie, before the age of 5 years); AND\nClinically severe seizures that af fect daily functioning and/or  interictal EEG abnormalities; AND\nNo other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient\"s symptoms.\n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nTesting Strategy\nThere is clinical and genetic overlap for many of the electroclinical syndromes previously discussed. If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based\non history , EEG findings, and other test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most likely to be involved,\nfollowed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular , if an SCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+),\nmolecular genetic testing of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by deletion and duplication analysis if a pathogenic\nvariant is not identified , should be obtained.\nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses a multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In\nthese cases, panels should meet the criteria outlined in evidence review 2.04.92 (general approach to evaluating the utility of genetic panels). Criteria\nfor use of  whole exome sequencing are outlined  in evidence review 2.04.102 (whole exome and whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of genetic\ndisorders).\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (T able PG2). The Society\"s\nnomenclature is recommended  by the Human V ariome Project, the Human  Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\nFDA REGULA TORY STATUS\nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the\ngeneral regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are\navailable under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity testing.\nTo date, the FDA  has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who receive testing for genes associated with epileptic\nencephalopathies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For Dravet syndrome, which\nappears to have the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-associated variants is high (up to 80%). For other\nearly-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true clinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However , studies reporting on the\noverall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy have reported detection rates for clinically significant\nvariants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The clinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known pathogenic variant.\nThe presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication management, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive\nplanning. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants associated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes\nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test validity , changes in reproductive decision making,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For most genetic epilepsies, which\nare thought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic variants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a\nlarge body of literature on associations between genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly understood. Published\nliterature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which have not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of\nstudies have also reported associations between genetic variants and antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment response, AED adverse ef fect risk, epilepsy\nphenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The largest number of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics,\nwhich has generally reported some association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , EPHX1 , CYP2C9 ,\nCYP2C19 ) and AED response. Similarly , genetic associations between a number of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported.\nHowever , no empirical evidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the changes in clinical management that\nmight occur as a result of testing are not well-defined. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Neurology et al.\nIn 2006, the American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society published joint guidelines on the diagnostic assessment of children with\nstatus epilepticus.86, These guidelines were reviewed and reaf firmed in 2022. With regard to  whether genetic testing should be routinely ordered  for\nchildren with status epilepticus, the guidelines stated: \"There is insuf ficient evidence to support or refute whether such studies should be done\nroutinely .”\nIn 2000, the American Academy of Neurology , Child Neurology Society , and the American Epilepsy Society published joint guidelines for evaluating a\nfirst nonfebrile seizure in children.87, This guidance was reviewed and reaf firmed in 2023. Routine electroencephalography was recommended  as part\nof the diagnostic evaluation; genetic testing was not addressed .\nInternational League Against Epilepsy\nIn 2015, the International League Against Epilepsy issued a report with recommendations on the management of infantile seizures, which included the\nfollowing related to genetic testing in epilepsy41,:\n\"Genetic screening should not be undertaken at a primary or secondary level of care, as the screening to identify those in need of specific\ngenetic analysis is based  on tertiary settings.”\n\"Standard care should permit genetic counseling by trained personnel to be undertaken at all levels of care (primary to quaternary).”\n\"Genetic evaluation for Dravet syndrome and other infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be available at tertiary and quaternary\nlevels of care (optimal intervention would permit an extended genetic evaluation).”\n\"Early diagnosis of some mitochondrial conditions may alter long-term  outcome, but whether screening at quaternary level is beneficial is\nunknown.”\nNational Society of Genetic Counselors\nIn 2022, the National Society of Genetic Counselors published a practice guideline on genetic testing and counseling for unexplained epilepsies.88,The\nSociety made the following relevant recommendations:\n\"We strongly recommend that individ uals with unexplained epilepsy be of fered genetic testing,  without limitation of age.\nWe strongly recommend comprehensive, multi- gene  testing, such as exome/ge nome sequencing  or multi- gene panel  as a first- tier test.\nWe conditionally recommend exome/ge nome sequencing  over multi- gene panel  as the first- tier test.\nThe multi-gene panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and  include copy number analysis.\"\n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nEuropean Academy of Neurology\nIn 2010, the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now the European Academy of Neurology) issued guidelines on the molecular diagnosis\nof channelopathies, epilepsies, migraine, stroke, and dementias.89, The guidelines made the following recommendations on epilepsy:\n\"There is good evidence to suggest that a thorough clinical and electrophysiological investigation may lead to the choice of the gene to be tested in\npatients with periodic paralysis (Level B). In myotonic disorders, it is recommended to first search for myotonic dystrophy and use clinical and\nelectrophysiological phenotype characterization to guide for molecular genetic testing (Level B).\nMolecular investigations are possible and may help in some cases to diagnose the condition but cannot be considered  as a routine procedure with\nregard to  the large  number of dif ferent mutations [variants] in dif ferent genes. Furthermore, diagnosis can be made more easily by clinical and\nphysiological investigation (Good Practice Point). One exception of note is the diagnosis of SMEI , in which mutations [variants] are found  in SCN1A  in\n80% of the patients (Level B).”\nNorth American Consensus Panel\nIn 2017, recommendations were published from a consensus panel of 14 physicians and 5 family members/caregivers of patients with Dravet\nsyndrome.90, There was strong consensus among panel members that genetic testing should be completed in all patients with clinical suspicion for\nDravet syndrome since this can lead to earlier diagnosis. Options for testing include SCN1A  sequencing followed by testing for deletions and\nduplications if sequencing is negative, or epilepsy gene panel testing, with no consensus among panel members about which option is superior . There\nwas strong consensus that epilepsy gene panel testing is preferred to SCN1A  testing if the clinical presentation is less clear or if the patient has\natypical features, and that karyotyping is not needed. The panel did not reach consensus about the utility of chromosomal microarray in patients with\nsuspected Dravet syndrome (72.2% agreed, 22.2% disagreed, 5.6% did not know) and concluded that this test can be considered. Based on strong\nconsensus, the panel recommended genetic testing in the following circumstances among children with normal development, seizures of unknown\netiology , and no evidence of causal lesion in the brain: infants with at least 2 prolonged focal febrile seizures, or children aged 1 to 3 years with at least\none prolonged febrile seizure before 18 months of age or myoclonic or atypical absence seizures that are refractory to at least one antiepileptic\nmedication. Infants who experience a single prolonged focal or generalized convulsion do not require genetic testing (strong consensus), but this can\nbe considered in children aged 1 to 3 years who experience multiple brief episodes of febrile seizure activity before 18 months of age or myoclonic or\natypical absence seizures that do not respond to antiepileptic medication (moderate consensus). The panel had moderate consensus about the role of\ngenetic testing (epilepsy gene panel) in teens and adults without congenital dysmorphism who have seizure activity resistant to antiepileptic medication\nand lack an early life history .\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.
