Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability.

This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022). The NSGC \nrecommendations are as follows (p. 4):  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  14 \n \n- Individuals with unexplained epilepsy should be offered genetic testing, without \nlimitatio\nn of age.  \n- Multi -gene, comprehensive testing, such as exome sequencing, genome sequencing or a \nmultigene panel as a first -tier test is strongly recommended  \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS)  \nPLUGS developed an expert- written exome sequencing coverage policy as part of their insurance \nalignment focus. Their policy includes the following criteria for exome sequencing:  \n● The patient and family history have been evaluated by a Board - Certifi ed or Board -\nEligible Medical Geneticist, or an Advanced Practice Nurse in Genetics (APGN) credentialed by either the Genetic Nursing Credentialing Commission (GNCC) or the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC ) AND  \n● A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype, \nbased on EITHER of the following AND  \n○ Multiple congenital abnormalities affecting unrelated organ systems  \n○ TWO  of the following criteria are met:  \n■ abnormality affecting at minimum a single organ system  signifi cant \nneurodevelopmental disorder (e.g., global developmental delay, intellectual disability , and/or period of unexplained developmental regression )  \n■ symptoms of a complex neurological condition (e.g. , dystonia, hemiplegia, spasticity, epilepsy, myopathy, muscular dystrophy ) \n■ severe neuropsychiatric condition (e.g. , schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Tourette syndrome, self - injurious behavior, reverse sleep -\nwake cycles )  \n■ family history strongly suggestive of a genetic etiology, including consanguinity  \n■ laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism \n● Alternate etiologies have been considered and ruled out when possible (e.g., environmental exposure, injury, infection), AND  \n● Clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single - gene \nor targeted panel testing (e.g., comparative genomic hybridization [CGH]/chromosomal microarray analysis [CMA]) is available, AND  \n● WES is more efficient and economical than the separate single -gene tests or panels \nthat would be recomme nded based on the differential diagnosis (e.g., genetic \nconditions that demonstrate a high degree of genetic heterogeneity), AND \n● A diagnosis cannot be made by standard clinical work - up, excluding invasive \nprocedures such as muscle biopsy, AND  \n● Predicted i mpact on health outcomes, as above, AND  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  15 \n \n● Pre- and post-test counseling by an appropriate provider (as deemed by the Health \nPlan\n policy), such as an American Board of Medical Genetics or American Board of \nGenetic Counseling - certified Genetic Counselor\nRapid Exome Sequencing  \nKingsmore SF, Cakici JA, Clark MM et al. 2019  \nThis report is from the NSIGHT2 study, a prospective randomized, controlled, blinded trial (RCT) \nin acutely ill infants, primarily from the NICU, PICU, and CVICU at Rady Children’s Hospi tal, \nSan Diego (RCHSD) to compare the effectiveness and outcomes between rWGS and rWES, with analysis as singleton probands and familial trios. The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available. They suggest that there should be predicted impact on health outcomes, including immediate impact on medical manag ement based on the \nmolecular results.

It is a heterogeneous condition that encompasses many types of seizures and varies in\nage of onset and severity . Many genetic epilepsies are thought to have a complex, multifactorial genetic basis. There are also numerous rare epileptic\nsyndromes associated with global developmental delay and/or cognitive impairment that occur in infancy or early childhood, and that may be caused\nby a single-gene pathogenic variant . Genetic testing is commercially available for a large number of genes that may be related to epilepsy .\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether genetic testing improves the net health outcome in individuals with infantile- or early-\nchildhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy or with presumed genetic epilepsy .\n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nGenetic testing for genes associated with infantile- and early-childhood onset epilepsy syndromes in individuals with infantile- and early-childhood-\nonset epilepsy syndromes in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (see Policy Guidelines section) may be considered medically necessary  if\npositive test results may:\nLead to changes in medication management; AND/OR\nLead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests are avoided ; AND/OR\nLead to changes in reproductive decision making.\nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other situations.\nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nPolicy Scope\nIncluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that might have a genetic etiology . In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as\nhaving underlying genetic cause or etiology when, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic defect and\nseizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or metabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy . The updated 2017 ILAE\nclassification system does not discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause.\nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom ( eg,\nDravet syndrome, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy , generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and intellectual disability limited to\nfemales, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy). Other clinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes  but are generally  secondary to epilepsy\nitself.\nExcluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of symptomatology , of which seizures may be one, such as the\nneurocutaneous disorders ( eg, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral malformations or abnormal\ncortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. Genetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed  in other evidence\nreviews (see Related Policies links).\nTesting that is limited to genotyping of cytochrome P450 ( CYP450)  genes is addressed  separately (evidence review 2.04.38).\nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry prior to  considering drug treatment\nwith carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nlabeling for carbamazepine.\nThis policy also does not address the testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA  polymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically\nsuspected mitochondrial disorders prior to  initiation of therapy with valproate. V alproate\"s label contains a black box warning related to increased risk of\nacute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients with POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA  labeling states\nthat valproate \" is contraindicated  in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under 2 years of age who\nare clinically suspected  of having a POLG-related disorder”.\nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and T esting Strategy\nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, are severe, and are characterized by\nepilepsy as the primary manifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League Against\nEpilepsy , these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndromes associated with a high probability of encephalopathic features\nthat present or worsen after the onset of epilepsy . Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or  intellectual disability , may be\npresent secondary to the epilepsy  itself. Specific clinical syndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include:FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

There is a challenge in defining the population appropriate for testing given that specific epileptic\nsyndromes may be associated  with dif ferent EEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe seizures prior to\nthe onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However , for this policy , the medically necessary policy statement would apply for\npatients with :\nOnset of seizures in early childhood (ie, before the age of 5 years); AND\nClinically severe seizures that af fect daily functioning and/or  interictal EEG abnormalities; AND\nNo other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient\"s symptoms.\n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nTesting Strategy\nThere is clinical and genetic overlap for many of the electroclinical syndromes previously discussed. If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based\non history , EEG findings, and other test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most likely to be involved,\nfollowed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular , if an SCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+),\nmolecular genetic testing of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by deletion and duplication analysis if a pathogenic\nvariant is not identified , should be obtained.\nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses a multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In\nthese cases, panels should meet the criteria outlined in evidence review 2.04.92 (general approach to evaluating the utility of genetic panels). Criteria\nfor use of  whole exome sequencing are outlined  in evidence review 2.04.102 (whole exome and whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of genetic\ndisorders).\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (T able PG2). The Society\"s\nnomenclature is recommended  by the Human V ariome Project, the Human  Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology<97>\"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign”<97>to describe\nvariants identified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG2.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\nFDA REGULA TORY STATUS\nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the\ngeneral regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are\navailable under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity testing.\nTo date, the FDA  has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who receive testing for genes associated with epileptic\nencephalopathies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For Dravet syndrome, which\nappears to have the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-associated variants is high (up to 80%). For other\nearly-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true clinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However , studies reporting on the\noverall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy have reported detection rates for clinically significant\nvariants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The clinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known pathogenic variant.\nThe presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication management, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive\nplanning. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants associated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes\nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test validity , changes in reproductive decision making,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For most genetic epilepsies, which\nare thought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic variants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a\nlarge body of literature on associations between genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly understood. Published\nliterature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which have not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of\nstudies have also reported associations between genetic variants and antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment response, AED adverse ef fect risk, epilepsy\nphenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The largest number of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics,\nwhich has generally reported some association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , EPHX1 , CYP2C9 ,\nCYP2C19 ) and AED response. Similarly , genetic associations between a number of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported.\nHowever , no empirical evidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the changes in clinical management that\nmight occur as a result of testing are not well-defined. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Neurology et al.\nIn 2006, the American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society published joint guidelines on the diagnostic assessment of children with\nstatus epilepticus.86, These guidelines were reviewed and reaf firmed in 2022. With regard to  whether genetic testing should be routinely ordered  for\nchildren with status epilepticus, the guidelines stated: \"There is insuf ficient evidence to support or refute whether such studies should be done\nroutinely .”\nIn 2000, the American Academy of Neurology , Child Neurology Society , and the American Epilepsy Society published joint guidelines for evaluating a\nfirst nonfebrile seizure in children.87, This guidance was reviewed and reaf firmed in 2023. Routine electroencephalography was recommended  as part\nof the diagnostic evaluation; genetic testing was not addressed .\nInternational League Against Epilepsy\nIn 2015, the International League Against Epilepsy issued a report with recommendations on the management of infantile seizures, which included the\nfollowing related to genetic testing in epilepsy41,:\n\"Genetic screening should not be undertaken at a primary or secondary level of care, as the screening to identify those in need of specific\ngenetic analysis is based  on tertiary settings.”\n\"Standard care should permit genetic counseling by trained personnel to be undertaken at all levels of care (primary to quaternary).”\n\"Genetic evaluation for Dravet syndrome and other infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be available at tertiary and quaternary\nlevels of care (optimal intervention would permit an extended genetic evaluation).”\n\"Early diagnosis of some mitochondrial conditions may alter long-term  outcome, but whether screening at quaternary level is beneficial is\nunknown.”\nNational Society of Genetic Counselors\nIn 2022, the National Society of Genetic Counselors published a practice guideline on genetic testing and counseling for unexplained epilepsies.88,The\nSociety made the following relevant recommendations:\n\"We strongly recommend that individ uals with unexplained epilepsy be of fered genetic testing,  without limitation of age.\nWe strongly recommend comprehensive, multi- gene  testing, such as exome/ge nome sequencing  or multi- gene panel  as a first- tier test.\nWe conditionally recommend exome/ge nome sequencing  over multi- gene panel  as the first- tier test.\nThe multi-gene panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and  include copy number analysis.\"\n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nEuropean Academy of Neurology\nIn 2010, the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now the European Academy of Neurology) issued guidelines on the molecular diagnosis\nof channelopathies, epilepsies, migraine, stroke, and dementias.89, The guidelines made the following recommendations on epilepsy:\n\"There is good evidence to suggest that a thorough clinical and electrophysiological investigation may lead to the choice of the gene to be tested in\npatients with periodic paralysis (Level B). In myotonic disorders, it is recommended to first search for myotonic dystrophy and use clinical and\nelectrophysiological phenotype characterization to guide for molecular genetic testing (Level B).\nMolecular investigations are possible and may help in some cases to diagnose the condition but cannot be considered  as a routine procedure with\nregard to  the large  number of dif ferent mutations [variants] in dif ferent genes. Furthermore, diagnosis can be made more easily by clinical and\nphysiological investigation (Good Practice Point). One exception of note is the diagnosis of SMEI , in which mutations [variants] are found  in SCN1A  in\n80% of the patients (Level B).”\nNorth American Consensus Panel\nIn 2017, recommendations were published from a consensus panel of 14 physicians and 5 family members/caregivers of patients with Dravet\nsyndrome.90, There was strong consensus among panel members that genetic testing should be completed in all patients with clinical suspicion for\nDravet syndrome since this can lead to earlier diagnosis. Options for testing include SCN1A  sequencing followed by testing for deletions and\nduplications if sequencing is negative, or epilepsy gene panel testing, with no consensus among panel members about which option is superior . There\nwas strong consensus that epilepsy gene panel testing is preferred to SCN1A  testing if the clinical presentation is less clear or if the patient has\natypical features, and that karyotyping is not needed. The panel did not reach consensus about the utility of chromosomal microarray in patients with\nsuspected Dravet syndrome (72.2% agreed, 22.2% disagreed, 5.6% did not know) and concluded that this test can be considered. Based on strong\nconsensus, the panel recommended genetic testing in the following circumstances among children with normal development, seizures of unknown\netiology , and no evidence of causal lesion in the brain: infants with at least 2 prolonged focal febrile seizures, or children aged 1 to 3 years with at least\none prolonged febrile seizure before 18 months of age or myoclonic or atypical absence seizures that are refractory to at least one antiepileptic\nmedication. Infants who experience a single prolonged focal or generalized convulsion do not require genetic testing (strong consensus), but this can\nbe considered in children aged 1 to 3 years who experience multiple brief episodes of febrile seizure activity before 18 months of age or myoclonic or\natypical absence seizures that do not respond to antiepileptic medication (moderate consensus). The panel had moderate consensus about the role of\ngenetic testing (epilepsy gene panel) in teens and adults without congenital dysmorphism who have seizure activity resistant to antiepileptic medication\nand lack an early life history .\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

The WGS was performed in ‘rapid run’ mode with minimum depth of 90 Gb per \ngenome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold. \nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and, in the NICU or PICU, when the \ntest is ordered but may be discharged before results are delivered. \nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using \nchromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within rWGS if the test is validated for CNV \nanalysis. \nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, include but are not \nlimited to any of the following: \n Choanal atresia \n Coloboma \n Hirschsprung disease \n Meconium ileus \n \nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic \nphenotype include, but are not limited to, any of the following: \n Abnormal newborn screen \n Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis \n Hyperammonemia \n Lactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion \n Refractory or severe hypoglycemia \n \nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include, but not limited to, any of the \nfollowing: \n Significant hypotonia \n Persistent seizures \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 4  \n Infant with high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief resolved unexplained event \n(BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features: \no Recurrent events without respiratory infection \no Recurrent witnessed seizure like events \no Required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \no Significantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate \nor lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other tests that suggest an inborn error \nof metabolism \n Significantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible \nchannelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or structural heart disease \n Family history of: \no Arrhythmia \no BRUE in sibling \no Developmental delay \no Inborn error of metabolism or genetic disease \no Long QT syndrome (LQTS) \no Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- \nor second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant \n \nBRUE \nBrief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) was previously known as apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE).

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient's existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit). As of September 2024 CytoScan HD Array contains 2.67 million markers for copy number , 750,000 SNVs, and 1.9 million\nnon-polymorphic probes.

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is being requested to evaluate for an underlying genetic etiology after pre-test discussion with a genetic specialist, and the family reports coverage through UHC. Family history is notable for a maternal uncle with a persistent severe immunologic disorder, which has been considered in the differential and counseling.\n\nInsurance Policy Document (source: BCBS_FEP_204102 Whole Exome and.pdf)\nFEP Medical Policy Manual\nFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic\nDisorders\nAnnual Effective Policy Date: July 1, 2024\nOriginal Policy Date: December 2013\nRelated Policies:\n2.04.105 - Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy\n2.04.109 - Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\n2.04.132 - Genetic Testing for Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies\n2.04.59 - Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\n2.04.89 - Genetic Testing for the Diagnosis of Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies\nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nDescription\nDescription\nWhole exome sequencing (WES) sequences the portion of the genome that contains protein-coding DNA, while whole genome sequencing (WGS)\nsequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome.

A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family .

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

Intellectual disability (ID, formerly \nreferred to as mental retardation) is \"a disability characterized by significant limitations \nin both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, \nsocial and practical adaptive skills.\"1 Global developmental delay (GDD) categorizes \nyounger children (typically less than 5 years of age) who have significant delay \n(characterized as performance two standard deviations or more below the mean on \nage-appropriate, standardized, normal-referenced testing) in two or more \ndevelopmental domains, including gross or fine motor, speech and language, cognitive,\nsocial and personal, and activities of daily living.2 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

With current diagnostic criteria, these categories were\nsubsumed under the diagnosis of ASD.\nSymptom onset is in early childhood (typically before 3 years of age).6,7 ASD is often \naccompanied by intellectual disability, behavioral difficulties, and/or sensory \nabnormalities. \nID and GDD may present in infancy or early childhood. ID is assessed in three \ndomains: intelligence (IQ), adaptive behavior, and systems of supports the individual \nrequires.1 Children with GDD have significant delay in two or more developmental \ndomains. Young children with GDD may later be diagnosed with ID and/or ASD.2,4 \nThere are both syndromic and non-syndromic forms of inherited ASD, ID, and GDD. \nThe constellation of associated findings is highly dependent on the underlying etiology. \nClinical information (e.g. presence of specific congenital malformations, dysmorphic \nfeatures, and other symptoms) may be used in some cases to help narrow down the \nsuspected cause. In these cases, it may be possible to identify a narrow subset of \ngenes that may be responsible for an individual's neurodevelopmental concerns.\nCause \nASD, ID, and GDD can develop secondary to head injury, birth complication, endocrine\ndisorder (e.g., hypothyroidism), toxic exposure (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome), inborn \nerror of metabolism (e.g., phenylketonuria), and central nervous system infection.2,6,7 \nThere are also many known genetic conditions that are associated with an increased \nrisk for ASD, ID, and GDD. A thorough clinical genetics evaluation is estimated to result\nin an identified cause in 30–40% of affected individuals with ASD.6 Chromosome \nmicroarray analysis was previously thought to have the highest diagnostic yield of any \nsingle test for these disorders, with an estimated detection rate of at least 10-20% for \nASD, ID, and GDD (often grouped together as neurodevelopmental disorders, or \nNDDs).4,6,8,9 Whole exome and genome sequencing have more recently been \ndemonstrated to have diagnostic yields of up to 35% for those with NDDs and \npotentially higher for those with other comorbidities such as epilepsy or congenital \nanomalies.9 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 8 of 17\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Autism                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nInheritance \nInheritance patterns differ between the various syndromes associated with ASD, ID, \nGDD. Inherited forms of these disorders can show autosomal dominant, autosomal \nrecessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial patterns of inheritance. \nDiagnosis \nASD, ID, and GDD are diagnosed through the evaluation of an individual's \ndevelopment and behaviors by an appropriate specialist (such as neurodevelopmental \npediatrician or developmental-behavioral pediatrician). Medical tests such as hearing \nscreening, vision screening, and neurological evaluations may also be performed.2,5 A \ndiagnosis of ASD and/or ID is often difficult to establish in infants and very young \nchildren, as the standardized methods used for diagnosis are less reliable in children \nunder the age of 5 years; the term \"global developmental delay\" is thus used to \ncategorize these individuals.2 Identifying an underlying genetic etiology for an \nindividual's NDD cannot provide a diagnosis of ASD versus ID versus a specific \nlearning disability.\nManagement \nManagement for ASD includes behavioral interventions such as applied behavioral \nanalysis (ABA) therapy, structured educational interventions, and in some cases, \npharmacotherapy.6,7 NDDs are also managed with therapies and educational \nintervention plans tailored to the individual's needs. In a limited number of cases \n(mostly metabolic disorders), knowing the genetic mutation that is responsible for a \nneurodevelopmental disorder can help to guide management. Identifying a genetic \nsyndrome may also alert the healthcare team to potential comorbidities for which \nevaluation and surveillance may be needed.\nSurvival \nWhile life expectancy in autism may be reported as reduced, this is often secondary to \naccidents such as drowning.3 With the exception of individuals with multiple disabilities \n(such as Down syndrome), the life expectancy of individuals with intellectual disability \nis now similar to that of the general population.10 Comorbid conditions can also affect \nsurvival in these disorders.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nTesting for ASD, ID, and GDD may include known familial mutation analysis, single \ngene sequence analysis, single gene deletion/duplication analysis, or multi-gene \npanels of various sizes. \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 9 of 17\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Autism                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nKnown Familial Mutation (KFM) Testing \nKnown familial mutations analysis is performed when a causative mutation has been \nidentified in a close biological relative of the individual requesting testing. Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis. These assays detect gains and losses too large to be \nidentified through standard sequence analysis, often single or multiple exons or whole \ngenes.\nMulti-Gene Testing Panels \nThe efficiency of NGS has led to an increasing number of large, multi-gene testing \npanels. NGS panels that test several genes at once are particularly well-suited to \nconditions caused by more than one gene or where there is considerable clinical \noverlap between conditions making it difficult to reliably narrow down likely causes. \nAdditionally, tests should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of identifying mutations \nin the genes of interest, contribute to alterations in management for an individual, and/\nor minimize the chance of finding variants of uncertain clinical significance. \nASD, ID and GDD multi-gene panels include a wide variety of genes: from a few to \nhundreds or even thousands. These disorders may also be grouped together in broad \n\"neurodevelopmental\" panels. Multi-gene panels may also include genes believed to \nbe associated with disease (e.g. \"susceptibility\" genes), but with a lower impact on risk \nthan recognized syndromes. Results for such genes are of less clear value because \nthere often are not clear management recommendations for mutation-positive \nindividuals.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

Rapid genome sequencing (81425, 81426, 0094U) is considered investigational  for all \nother indications. \nback to top  \n \nNOTES AND DEFINITIONS  \nExome Sequencing (ES)  is a genomic technique for sequencing all of the protein-coding regions \nof genes in the genome (also known as the exome). \nGenom\ne Sequencing (GS)  is a genomic technique for sequencing the complete DNA sequence, \nwhich includes protein coding as well as non- codin g DNA elements.  \nTrio \nTesting  includes testing of the child and both biological/genetic parents and increases the \nchances of finding a definitive diagnosis, while reducing false- positi ve findings.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  10 \n \nComparator Exome Sequencing is used only for comparison with the proband (individual \nundergoing exome sequencing) and is used to inform the pathogenicity of variants. A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022).

The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available.

Whole exome sequencing and WGS have been proposed  for use in patients presenting\nwith disorders and anomalies not explained by a standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a\nbroad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether whole exome or whole genome sequencing improves the net health outcome in\nindividuals with suspected genetic disorders.\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning.

Syndromic hearing loss \nrefers to hearing loss associated with other medical or physical findings, including visible abnormalities of the external ear. Because syndromic hearing loss oc curs as part of a syndrome \nof multiple clinical manifestations, it is often recognized more readily as hereditary. Nonsyndromic hearing loss is defined as hearing loss not associated with other physical signs or symptoms. Nonsyndromic hearing loss accounts  for 70% to 80% of genetically determined \ndeafness, and it is more difficult to determine whether the etiology is hereditary or acquired.  \nThis policy primarily focuses on the use of genetic testing to identify a cause of suspected hereditary hearing loss.  The diagnosis of syndromic hearing loss can be made on the basis of \nassociated clinical findings. However, at the time of hearing loss presentation, associated clinical findings may not be apparent; furthermore, variants in certain genetic loci may cause both syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing loss. Given this overlap, the policy focuses on genetic testing for hereditary hearing loss more generally.\nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE\nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria section.

About 50% of individuals with autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss have pathogenic variants in the GJB2  gene, in the ot her 50% of patients with \napparent autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss, numerous other genes are implicated. There is no single identifiable gene responsible for most cases of autosomal dominant hereditary hearing loss.  \nIf there is suspicion for au tosomal recessive congenital hearing loss, it would be reasonable to \nbegin with testing of GJB2  and GJB6  and if testing is negative, screening for the other genes \nassociated with hearing loss with a multigene panel would be efficient. An alternative strate gy \nfor suspected autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant hearing loss would be to obtain a \nmultigene panel that includes GJB2 and GJB6 as a first step.  \nGiven the extreme heterogeneity in genetic causes of hearing loss, these 2 strategies may be consider ed reasonably equivalent.  \nback to top   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Hearing Loss             \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision 3/1/2023    \n \n \n   \n5 \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nKnown Familial Variant Analysis for Hereditary Hearing Loss  \nGenetic Support Foundation \nThe Genetic Support Foundation’s Genetics 101 information on inheritance patterns says the \nfollowing about testing for familial pathogenic variants:  \nGenetic testing for someone who may be at risk for an inherited disease is always easier if we know the specific genetic cause. Oftentimes, the best  way to find the genetic cause \nis to start by testing someone in the family who is known or strongly suspected to have the disease. If their testing is positive, then we can say that we have found the familial pathogenic (harmful) variant. We can use this as a marker to test other members of the \nfamily to see who is also at risk.\nGJB2 and GJB6  Sequencing and/or Deletion Duplication Analysis or Multigene Panel \nAnalysis \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published guidelines in 2022 \nto guide genetics evaluation for individuals with hearing loss: “For individuals lacking physical findings suggestive of a known syndrome, a tiered diagnostic approach should be implemented. Unless clinical and/or family history suggests a specific genetic etiology, comprehensive HL gene panel testing should be initiated.” (page 9) The guidelines state the following: “Although nonsyndromic HL [hearing loss] demonstrates high genetic heterogeneity, the DFNB1 locus, which includes the GJB2  gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26 and the GJB6  gene \nencoding the gap junction protein connexin 30, accounts for an estimated 50% of all autosomal recessive nonsyndromic HL and 15% to 40% of all deaf individuals in a variety of populations.” (page 3) \nGeneReviews: Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness Overview  \nGeneReviews is an expert -authored review of current literature on a genetic disease, and goes \nthrough a rigorous editing and peer review process before being published online.  In the section \nthat discusses possible differential diagnosis for hereditary hearing loss and deafness, it states:   \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Hearing Loss             \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision 3/1/2023    \n \n \n   \n6 \nIn developed countries approximately 80% of congenital hearing loss is due to genetic causes \nand the remainder to environmental (acquired) causes. Acquired causes should be differentiated from genetic causes to inform the evaluation and required ancillary testing. Acquired hearing loss in children commonly results from prenatal infections from ‘TORCH’ organisms\n…or \npostnatal infections (such as CMV). Acquired hearing loss in adults is most often attributed to environmental factors.  \nback to top  \nReviews, Revisions, and Appr ovals  Revision \nDate  Approval \nDate  \nPolicy developed  03/23  03/23  \n \nREFERENCES \n1.

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022).

The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available. They suggest that there should be predicted impact on health outcomes, including immediate impact on medical manag ement based on the \nmolecular results.

Whole exome sequencing and WGS have been proposed  for use in patients presenting\nwith disorders and anomalies not explained by a standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a\nbroad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether whole exome or whole genome sequencing improves the net health outcome in\nindividuals with suspected genetic disorders.\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility .

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered. In particular, a patient who had negative germline BRCA1 and 2\ntesting, who is from a family with no pathogenic variants, should be considered for \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results.

The USPSTF guideline recommended:10\nWhen a woman's personal or family history of cancer is consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family \nhistory of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry \nassociated with breast cancer susceptibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) gene mutations with\nan appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from \nfamilies with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations \nare more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for \nthese specific mutations.\"\nNote  This benefit/harm statement only applies to those jurisdictions that do not have \nMedicare guidance. Based upon the guidelines and evidence provided in the clinical \npolicy, following EviCore's criteria for BRCA analysis will ensure that testing will be \navailable to those members most likely to benefit from a genetic diagnosis. For those \nnot meeting criteria, it ensures alternate diagnostic strategies are considered. \nHowever, it is possible that some members who have the condition, but have non-\nstandard features, will not receive an immediate approval for testing.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The WGS  was performed  in \n‘rapid  run’ mode  with  a minimum  depth  of 90 Gb per genome  and average  depth  of coverage  of 40-fold.  \nFor rapid  WES  or WGS,  the individual  should  be critically  ill and in the neonatal  or pediatric  intensive  \ncare  units  (NICU,  PICU)  when  the test is ordered  but may  be discharged  before  results  are delivered.  \nCopy  number  variation  (CNV)  analysis  should  be performed  in parallel  with  rWGS  using  chromosomal  \nmicroarray  analysis  (CMA)  or directly  within  rWGS  if the test is validated  for CNV  analysis.  \nExamples  of specific  malformations  highly  suggestive  of a genetic  etiology,  include  but are not limited  to \nany of the following:  \n• Choanal  atresia  \n• Coloboma  \n• Hirschsprung  disease  \n• Meconium  ileus  \nExamples  of an abnormal  laboratory  test suggesting  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype,  \ninclude  but are not limited  to any of the following:  \n• Abnormal  newborn  screen  \n• Conjugated  hyperbilirubinemia  not due to total  parental  nutrition  (TPN)  cholestasis  \n• Hyperammonemia  \n• Lactic  acidosis  not due to poor  perfusion  \n• Refractory  or severe  hypoglycemia  \nExamples  of clinical  features  suggesting  a genetic  disease  include  but are not limited  to any of the \nfollowing:  \n• Significant  hypotonia.  \n• Persistent  seizures.  \n• Infant  with  high  risk stratification  on evaluation  for a Brief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  (BRUE)  \n(see  below)  with  any of the following  features:  \no Recurrent  events  without  respiratory  infection  \no Recurrent  witnessed  seizure  like events  \no Required  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  \no Significantly  abnormal  chemistry  including  but not limited  to electrolytes,  bicarbonate  \nor lactic  acid,  venous  blood  gas, glucose,  or other  tests  that suggest  an inborn  error  of \nmetabolism  \n• Significantly  abnormal  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  including  but not limited  to possible  \nchannelopathies,  arrhythmias,  cardiomyopathies,  myocarditis,  or structural  heart  disease  \n• Family  history  of: \no Arrhythmia  \no BRUE  in sibling  \no Developmental  delay  \no Inborn  error  of metabolism  or genetic  disease  \no Long  QT syndrome  (LQTS)  \no Sudden  unexplained  death  (including  unexplained  car accident  or drowning)  in first- or \nsecond -degree  family  members  before  age 35, and particularly  as an infant  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   4 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  was previously  known  as Apparent  Life Threatening  Event  (ALTE).  In a \npractice  guideline  from  the American  Academy  of Pediatrics  (AAP),  BRUE  is defined  as an event  \noccurring  in an infant  younger  than  1 year  of age when  the observer  reports  a sudden,  brief  (usually  less \nthan  one minute),  and now  resolved  episode  of one or more  of the following:  \n• Absent,  decreased,  or irregular  breathing  \n• Altered  level  of responsiveness  \n• Cyanosis  or pallor  \n• Marked  change  in tone  (hyper - or hypotonia)  \nA BRUE  is diagnosed  only  when  there  is no explanation  for a qualifying  event  after  conducting  an \nappropriate  history  and physical  examination.  \nNote:  More  information  is available  at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590   \nTrio Testing  \nThe recommended  option  for testing  when  possible  is testing  of the child  and both  parents  (trio  testing).  \nTrio testing  increases  the chance  of finding  a definitive  diagnosis  and reduces  false -positive  findings.  \nTrio testing  is preferred  whenever  possible  but should  not delay  testing  of a critically  ill individual  when  \nrapid  testing  is indicated.  Testing  of one available  parent  should  be done  if both  are not immediately  \navailable  and one or both  parents  can be done  later  if needed.  \nGenetics  Nomenclature  Update  \nThe Human  Genome  Variation  Society  nomenclature  is used  to report  information  on variants  found  in \nDNA  and serves  as an international  standard  in DNA  diagnostics.  It is being  implemented  for genetic  \ntesting  medical  evidence  review  updates  starting  in 2017  (see Table  PG1).  The Society's  nomenclature  is \nrecommended  by the Human  Variome  Project,  the Human  Genome  Organisation,  and by the Human  \nGenome  Variation  Society  itself.  \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  and the Association  for Molecular  Pathology  \nstandards  and guidelines  for interpretation  of sequence  variants  represent  expert  opinion  from  both  \norganizations,  in addition  to the College  of American  Pathologists.  These  recommendations  primarily  \napply  to genetic  tests  used  in clinical  laboratories,  including  genotyping,  single  genes,  panels,  exomes,  \nand genomes.  Table  PG2 shows  the recommended  standard  terminology -\"pathogenic,\"  \"likely  \npathogenic,\"  \"uncertain  significance,\"  \"likely  benign,\"  and \"benign\" -to describe  variants  identified  that \ncause  Mendelian  disorders.  \nTable  PG1.

The interpretation  of the results  of genetic  tests  and the understanding  of risk factors  can \nbe very  difficult  and complex.  Therefore,  genetic  counseling  will assist  individuals  in understanding  the \npossible  benefits  and harms  of genetic  testing,  including  the possible  impact  of the information  on the \nindividual's  family.  Genetic  counseling  may  alter  the utilization  of genetic  testing  substantially  and may  \nreduce  inappropriate  testing.  Genetic  counseling  should  be performed  by an individual  with  experience  \nand expertise  in genetic  medicine  and genetic  testing  methods.  \nCoding  \nSee the Codes  table  for details.  \nBENEFIT  APPLICATION  \nBlue  Card/National  Account  Issues  \nSome  Plans  may  have  contract  or benefit  exclusions  for genetic  testing.  \nBenefit  Exceptions  \nThis policy  may  not apply  to all lines  of business  such  as the Federal  Employee  Program,  Medicare  \nSupplement,  Medicare  Advantage,  Medicaid,  and certain  self-insured  groups.  \nBACKGROUND  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  (WES)  is targeted  next -generation  sequencing  (NGS)  of the subset  of the \nhuman  genome  that contains  functionally  important  sequences  of protein -coding  DNA,  while  whole  \ngenome  sequencing  (WGS)  uses  NGS  techniques  to sequence  both  coding  and noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  Whole  exome  sequencing  and WGS  have  been  proposed  for use in patients  presenting  with  \ndisorders  and anomalies  not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  Potential  candidates  for WES  and \nWGS  include  patients  who  present  with  a broad  spectrum  of suspected  genetic  conditions.  \nGiven  the variety  of disorders  and management  approaches,  there  are a variety  of potential  health  \noutcomes  from  a definitive  diagnosis.  In general,  the outcomes  of a molecular  genetic  diagnosis  include  \n(1) impacting  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) informing  follow -up that can benefit  a child  by reducing  \nmorbidity,  and (3) affecting  reproductive  planning  for parents  and potentially  the affected  patient.  \nThe standard  diagnostic  workup  for patients  with  suspected  Mendelian  disorders  may  include  \ncombinations  of radiographic,  electrophysiologic,  biochemical,  biopsy,  and targeted  genetic  \nevaluations.1, The search  for a diagnosis  may  thus  become  a time -consuming  and expensive  process.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  Technology  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  using  NGS  technology  can facilitate  obtaining  a genetic  diagnosis  in \npatients  efficiently.  Whole  exome  sequencing  is limited  to most  of the protein -coding  sequence  of an \nindividual  (»85%),  is composed  of about  20,000  genes  and 180,000  exons  (protein -coding  segments  of a \ngene),  and constitutes  approximately  1% of the genome.  It is believed  that the exome  contains  about  \n85%  of heritable  disease -causing  variants.  Whole  exome  sequencing  has the advantage  of speed  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   6 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nefficiency  relative  to Sanger  sequencing  of multiple  genes.  Whole  exome  sequencing  shares  some  \nlimitations  with  Sanger  sequencing.  For example,  it will not identify  the following:  intronic  sequences  or \ngene  regulatory  regions;  chromosomal  changes;  large  deletions;  duplications;  or rearrangements  within  \ngenes,  nucleotide  repeats,  or epigenetic  changes.  Whole  genome  sequencing  uses  techniques  similar  to \nWES  but includes  noncoding  regions.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has a greater  ability  to detect  large  \ndeletions  or duplications  in protein -coding  regions  compared  with  WES  but requires  greater  data  \nanalytics.  \nTechnical  aspects  of WES  and WGS  are evolving,  including  the development  of databases  such  as the \nNational  Institutes  of Health’s  ClinVar  database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to catalog  \nvariants,  uneven  sequencing  coverage,  gaps  in exon  capture  before  sequencing,  and difficulties  with  \nnarrowing  the large  initial  number  of variants  to manageable  numbers  without  losing  likely  candidate  \ndisease -associated  variants.  The variability  contributed  by the different  platforms  and procedures  used  \nby different  clinical  laboratories  offering  exome  sequencing  as a clinical  service  is unknown.  \nIn 2013,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics,  Association  for Molecular  Pathology,  \nand College  of American  Pathologists  convened  a workgroup  to standardize  terminology  for describing  \nsequence  variants.  In 2015,  guidelines  developed  by this workgroup  describe  criteria  for classifying  \npathogenic  and benign  sequence  variants  based  on 5 categories  of data:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  \nuncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and benign.2, \nRegulatory  Status  \nClinical  laboratories  may  develop  and validate  tests  in-house  and market  them  as a laboratory  service;  \nlaboratory -developed  tests  must  meet  the general  regulatory  standards  of the Clinical  Laboratory  \nImprovement  Amendments  (CLIA).  Whole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  tests  as a clinical  service  are \navailable  under  the auspices  of the CLIA.  Laboratories  that offer  laboratory -developed  tests  must  be \nlicensed  by the CLIA  for high -complexity  testing.  To date,  the U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  \nhas chosen  not to require  any regulatory  review  of this test.  \nRATIONALE  \nThis evidence  review  was created  in September  2013  with  searches  of the PubMed  database.  The most  \nrecent  literature  update  was performed  through  January 6, 2025 . \nEvidence  reviews  assess  whether  a medical  test is clinically  useful.  A useful  test provides  information  to \nmake  a clinical  management  decision  that improves  the net health  outcome.  That  is, the balance  of \nbenefits  and harms  is better  when  the test is used  to manage  the condition  than  when  another  test or \nno test is used  to manage  the condition.  \nThe first step  in assessing  a medical  test is to formulate  the clinical  context  and purpose  of the test.  The \ntest must  be technically  reliable,  clinically  valid,  and clinically  useful  for that purpose.  Evidence  reviews  \nassess  the evidence  on whether  a test is clinically  valid  and clinically  useful.  Technical  reliability  is \noutside  the scope  of these  reviews,  and credible  information  on technical  reliability  is available  from  \nother  sources.  \nThis review  was informed  in part by a TEC Special  Report  (2013)  on exome  sequencing  for patients  with  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders.3, \nIn 2018,  Smith  et al reported  a scoping  review  of genome  and exome  sequencing  as a diagnostic  tool for \npediatric  patients.  4, The authors  identified  171 publications,  although  131 were  case  reports.  They  \nconcluded  that diagnostic  yield  was the only  consistently  reported  outcome.  The median  diagnostic  \nyield  in publications  including  more  than  single  case  reports  was 33%  but varied  by broad  clinical  \ncategories  and test type.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   7 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe following  sections  review  evidence  by test type  (whole  exome  sequencing  [WES]  and whole  genome  \nsequencing  [WGS]),  broad  type  of disorder,  and care  setting  (intensive  care  vs. not intensive  care).  \nPromotion  of greater  diversity  and inclusion  in clinical  research  of historically  marginalized  groups  (e.g.,  \nPeople  of Color  [African -American,  Asian,  Black,  Latino  and Native  American];  LGBTQIA  (Lesbian,  Gay,  \nBisexual,  Transgender,  Queer,  Intersex,  Asexual);  Women;  and People  with  Disabilities  [Physical  and \nInvisible])  allows  policy  populations  to be more  reflective  of and findings  more  applicable  to our diverse  \nmembers.  While  we also strive  to use inclusive  language  related  to these  groups  in our policies,  use of \ngender -specific  nouns  (e.g.,  women,  men,  sisters,  etc.)  will continue  when  reflective  of language  used  in \npublications  describing  study  populations.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  \nDisorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WES  in children  who  have  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  workup  is to establish  a \nmolecular  diagnosis.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  \nbe considered  clinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that are suspected  to have  a genetic  basis,  but are not \nexplained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or \na neurodevelopmental  disorder:  standard  clinical  workup  without  WES.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   8 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nA number  of studies  have  reported  on the use of WES  in clinical  practice  (Table  1). Typically,  the \npopulations  included  in these  studies  have  had suspected  rare genetic  disorders,  although  the specific  \npopulations  vary.  \nSeries  have  been  reported  with  as many  as 2000  patients.  The most  common  reason  for referral  to a \ntertiary  care  center  was an unexplained  neurodevelopmental  disorder.  Many  patients  had been  through  \na standard  clinical  workup  and testing  without  identification  of a genetic  variant  to explain  their  \ncondition.  Diagnostic  yield  in these  studies,  defined  as the proportion  of tested  patients  with  clinically  \nrelevant  genomic  anomalies,  ranged  from  25%  to 48%.  Because  there  is no reference  standard  for the \ndiagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  strategies,  clinical  confirmation  may  be the \nonly  method  for determining  false -positive  and false -negative  rates.  No reports  were  identified  of \nincorrect  diagnoses,  and how  often  they  might  occur  is unclear.  \nWhen  used  as a first-line test in infants  with  multiple  congenital  anomalies  and dysmorphic  features,  \ndiagnostic  yield  may  be as high  as 58%.  Testing  parent -child  trios  has been  reported  to increase  \ndiagnostic  yield,  to identify  an inherited  variant  from  an unaffected  parent  and be considered  benign,  or \nto identify  a de novo  variant  not present  in an unaffected  parent.  First -line trio testing  for children  with  \ncomplex  neurologic  disorders  was shown  to increase  the diagnostic  yield  (29%,  plus a possible  diagnostic  \nfinding  in 27%)  compared  with  a standard  clinical  pathway  (7%)  performed  in parallel  in the same  \npatients.5, \nTable  1.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs).  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WES  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nCohort  studies  following  children  from  presentation  to outcomes  have  not been  reported.  There  are \nconsiderable  challenges  conducting  studies  of sufficient  size given  underlying  genetic  heterogeneity,  and \nincluding  follow -up adequate  to observe  final  health  outcomes.  Studies  addressing  clinical  utility  have  \nreported  mainly  diagnostic  yield  and management  changes.  Thus,  it is difficult  to quantify  lower  or \nupper  bounds  for any potential  improvement  in the net health  outcome  owing  in part to the \nheterogeneity  of disorders,  rarity,  and outcome  importance  that may  differ  according  to identified  \npathogenic  variants.  Actionable  items  following  testing  in the reviewed  studies  (Table  1) included  family  \nplanning,  change  in management,  change  or avoidance  of additional  testing,  surveillance  for associated  \nmorbidities,  prognosis,  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nThe evidence  reviewed  here  reflects  the accompanying  uncertainty,  but supports  a perspective  that \nidentifying  a pathogenic  variant  can (1) impact  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) inform  follow -up that can \nbenefit  a child  by reducing  morbidity  and rarely  potential  mortality,  and (3) affect  reproductive  planning  \nfor parents  and later,  potentially  the affected  child.  When  recurrence  risk can be estimated  for an \nidentified  variant  (e.g., by including  parent  testing),  future  reproductive  decisions  can be affected.

Comparative  studies  have  reported  an increase  in \ndiagnostic  yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Thus,  for individuals  who  have  a suspected  \ngenetic  etiology  but for whom  the specific  genetic  alteration  is unclear  or unidentified  by a standard  \nclinical  workup,  WES  may  return  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  A genetic  diagnosis  for these  patients  is \nreported  to change  management,  including  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  \nending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  for Children  with  a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  other  than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  \nWorkup;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nMost  of the literature  on WES  is on neurodevelopmental  disorders  in children;  however,  other  potential  \nindications  for WES  have  been  reported  (Table  2). These  include  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy,  \ninherited  retinal  disease,  and other  disorders  including  mitochondrial,  endocrine,  and immunologic  \ndisorders.  \nThe purpose  of WES  in patients  who  have  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or \nheritable  disorder  may  be considered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  a disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that is suspected  to have  a genetic  \nbasis  but is not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  \nmultiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder:  a standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  \nvaries  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  \ndysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and \nimaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  \nfor that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   13 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies,  therefore  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nStudies  have  assessed  WES  for a broad  spectrum  of disorders.  The diagnostic  yield  in patient  \npopulations  restricted  to specific  phenotypes  ranges  from  3% for colorectal  cancer  to 60%  for \nunexplained  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  (Table  2). Some  studies  used  a virtual  gene  panel  that is \nrestricted  to genes  associated  with  the phenotype,  while  others  have  examined  the whole  exome,  either  \ninitially  or sequentially.  An advantage  of WES  over  individual  gene  or gene  panel  testing  is that the \nstored  data  allows  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  Whole  exome  \nsequencing  has also been  reported  to be beneficial  in patients  with  atypical  presentations.  \nTable  2.

Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for \nany specific  disorder,  and study  of WES  in these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  \nchanges  in patient  management.  \nRepeat  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test,  in individuals  who  have  \npreviously  received  WES  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  \nThe criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be considered  \nclinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   18 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test.  \nRepeat  WES  is intended  to be used  after  a WES  test has been  performed  without  establishing  a \ndiagnosis.  Repeat  testing  could  lead  to a diagnosis  in a previously  undiagnosed  individual  as new  \npathogenic  genes  or variants  are identified  or new  diagnostic  technologies  are developed.  Additionally,  \ntesting  strategies  might  be revised  based  on the emergence  of new  clinical  features  as a child  develops  \nor the identification  of congenital  anomalies  or developmental  disorders  in additional  family  members.  \nComparators  \nThe comparators  of interest  for this indication  are no further  molecular  testing  following  an initial  WES  \ntest,  and WGS  following  an initial  WES  test.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of individuals  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  individual.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of repeat  WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  of repeat  WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nSystematic  Review  \nDai et al (2022)  conducted  a systematic  review  to determine  the diagnostic  yield  of sequencing  \nreanalysis  of data  from  cases  with  no diagnosis  following  an initial  WES  or WGS  test (Table  5).33,The \nprimary  measure  of efficacy  was the proportion  of undiagnosed  individuals  reaching  a positive  diagnosis  \non reanalysis  after  first round  sequencing  and analysis.  Results  are summarized  in Table  6. The overall  \ndiagnostic  yield  was 0.10  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI], 0.06  to 0.13).  Using  the GRADE  framework,  the \ncertainty  of the evidence  for this outcome  was rated  moderate  certainty.  Confidence  in the estimate  \nwas downgraded  due to significant  heterogeneity  across  studies  that could  not be explained  by \nsubgroup  analyses.  The researchers  performed  subgroup  analyses  on the basis  of time  interval  between  \nthe original  analysis  and reanalysis  (<24  months  compared  with  ≥24 months),  sequencing  methodology  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   19 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n(WES  vs. WGS),  study  sample  size (<50,  50 to 100,  >100  patients),  sequencing  of family  members  for \nsegregation  analysis,  whether  research  validation  of novel  variants/genes  were  conducted,  and whether  \nany artificial  intelligence -based  tools  were  used  in variant  curation.  These  subgroup  analyses  did not \nidentify  any statistically  significant  differences  in diagnostic  yield  estimates.  \nTable  5.

In 62%  of these  cases  the reason  was a new  gene  discovery,  in 15%  the reasons  were  \nunknown  or unspecified,  and in 11%  the reason  was validation  of candidate  variants  through  research  or \nexternal  collaboration.  Other  reasons  included  bioinformatic  pipeline  improvements  (3.3%),  laboratory  \nerrors/misinterpretations  (2.8%),  updated  clinical  phenotypes  (2.1%),  copy  number  variants  (1.9%),  and \nadditional  segregation  studies  in relatives  (1.2%).  \nOnly  7 of 29 studies  provided  individual  clinical  information  of sequenced  probands  (e.g.,  diagnosed  \nvariant,  or timing  of reanalysis)  but instead  reported  summary  data  of the overall  population.  There  \nwere  11 studies  that reported  the finding  of variants  of uncertain  significance  (VUS)  and/or  variants  in \nnovel  genes  but only  8 studies  provided  research  evidence  confirming  their  pathogenicity.  Only  3 studies  \ndiscussed  whether  a genetic  diagnosis  led to management  changes,  and the impact  on management  was \nonly  described  in a subgroup  of individuals.  To address  uncertainties  in the evidence,  the review  authors  \nrecommended  best  practices  for future  research  including  detailed  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria,  \ndetailed  clinical  information  on each  case,  clear  documentation  of methodology  used  for initial  and re-\nanalysis,  and reporting  of the rationale  for attribution  of pathogenicity.  \nNonrandomized  Studies  \nTable  7 summarizes  nonrandomized  studies  published  after  the Dai et al (2022)  systematic  review.

The net health  outcome  can be \nimproved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  more  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or \ntesting.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of repeat  WES  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  following  an initial  WES  test were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nDue to heterogeneity  and limitations  in individuals  studies,  the evidence  is insufficient  to establish  a \nchain  of evidence  for the clinical  utility  of repeat  WES  testing  in individuals  who  are undiagnosed  \nfollowing  an initial  WES  test.  \nSection  Summary:  Repeat  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  \nIn a systematic  review  of nonrandomized  studies,  re-analysis  of WES  data  resulted  in an 11%  increase  in \ndiagnostic  yield  (95%  CI 8% to 14%)  in individuals  who  were  previously  undiagnosed  via WES.  However,  \nthe evidence  is insufficient  to establish  the clinical  utility  of repeat  testing.  Individual  studies  lacked  \ndetail  on the reasons  for new  diagnoses,  changes  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the \nfrequency  of the identification  of VUS.  Additionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  \nestablished,  and there  are no clear  guidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  \ntesting.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup  or Whole  Exome  \nSequencing;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  is to establish  a \nmolecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the genome.  The criteria  under  \nwhich  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be considered  clinically  useful  are stated  \nabove.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   23 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup.  \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible.  Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  as a \nclinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practices  are currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  A standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS,  and WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  Compared  to Standard  Clinical  Workup  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   24 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  workup  \nin several  observational  studies,  both  prospective  and retrospective.

Ten studies (ES=9; GS=1), \ncomprising 1905 probands, compared diagnostic rate among pediatric vs adult patients within cohorts, \nfinding pediatric patients had 1.6 -times odds of a diagnosis compared to that of adult patients (95% CI \n1.22 -2.10, I 2 = 0%, P <.01).  \nAcross all age groups, diagnostic rates of whole exome sequencing (0.38; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.40) and \nwhole genome sequencing (0.34; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.38) were similar (p=.1). Within -cohort comparison \nfrom 9 studies (2269 probands) showed 1.2 -times odds of diagnosis by whole genome sequencing over \nwhole exome sequencing (95% CI: 0.79 to 1.83; p=.38).Whole genome sequencing studies identified a \nhigher range of novel genes (GS: 2 -579 novel genes based on 6 studies, 5538 probands vs. ES: 1 -75 novel \ngenes based on 22 studies, 5038 probands). Variants of unknown significance (VUS) had wide ranges for \nboth ES and GS (ES: <1 -59%; GS: 6 -50%; p=.78), with severe heterogeneity in methodology and \nreporting. Overall, VUS showed a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2021.  \nThe quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool was used to assess bias in the included \nstudies. Studies with a low bias ranking in all domains were deemed high -quality and were used in a \nseparate analysis. Among the 22 high -quality studies (4,580 probands), the clinical utility of whole \ngenome sequencing (0.77; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.90) was higher than that of whole exome sequencing (0.44; \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   28 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n95% CI: 0.30 to 0.58) (p<.01). It is unclear if any study compared whole exome sequencing with \nassessment of structural variants versus whole genome sequencing.  \nA 2020  Health  Technology  Assessment  conducted  by Ontario  Health,  with  literature  searches  conducted  \nin January  2019,  included  a comparative  review  of the diagnostic  yield  of WES  and WGS  in children  with  \nunexplained  developmental  disabilities  or multiple  congenital  anomalies.45, The diagnostic  yield  across  \nall studies  was 37%  (95%  CI, 34%  to 40%).  More  studies,  with  an overall  larger  sample  size,  were  \nincluded  in the examination  on WES  (34 studies,  N=9142)  than  on WGS  (9 studies,  N=648).  Confidence  \nintervals  for studies  using  WES  versus  WGS  overlapped  (37%;  95%  CI, 34%  to 40%,  vs. 40%;  95%  CI, 32%  \nto 49%).  Diagnostic  yield  ranged  between  16%  and 73%,  with  variation  attributed  largely  to technology  \nused  and participant  selection.  The overall  quality  of the evidence  was rated  as very  low,  downgraded  \nfor risk of bias,  inconsistency,  indirectness,  and imprecision.  \nIn some  studies  of WGS,  the genes  examined  were  those  previously  associated  with  the phenotype,  \nwhile  other  studies  were  research -based  and conducted  more  exploratory  analysis.  It has been  noted  \nthat genomes  sequenced  with  WGS  are available  for future  review  when  new  variants  associated  with  \nclinical  diseases  are discovered.37, \nStudies  have  shown  that WGS  can detect  more  pathogenic  variants  than  WES,  due to an improvement  in \ndetecting  copy  number  variants,  insertions  and deletions,  intronic  single -nucleotide  variants,  and exonic  \nsingle -nucleotide  variants  in regions  with  poor  coverage  on WES.  A majority  of studies  have  described  \nmethods  for interpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  \nincluded  in the diagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  not reported.  Five studies  included  in the Ontario  \nHealth  Technology  Assessment  review  provided  data  on the yield  of VUS,  with  an overall  yield  of 17%.  \nOnly  1 of the 5 studies  used  WGS,  however.  The review  authors  noted,  \"Whole  genome  sequencing  \nalways  results  in substantially  longer  lists of variants  of unknown  significance  than  whole  exome  \nsequencing  does.  Interpreting  and acting  upon  variants  of unknown  clinical  significance  is the single  \ngreatest  challenge  identified  by clinicians….”45, \nClinically  Useful  \nA test is clinically  useful  if the use of the results  informs  management  decisions  that improve  the net \nhealth  outcome  of care.  The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  or \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WGS  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  outside  of critical  care  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nClinical  validity  is established  based  on the meaningful  diagnostic  yield  associated  with  WGS  when  a \ngenetic  etiology  is uncertain  after  standard  workup.  Studies  on WGS  report  changes  in management  \nthat would  improve  health  outcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as \nthose  with  WES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   29 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup;  Individuals  who  are \nnot Critically  Ill \nWhole  genome  sequencing  has been  studied  in non-critically  ill children  with  congenital  anomalies  and \ndevelopmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup.  The diagnostic  yield  for WGS  \nhas been  reported  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for interpretation  of \nWGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the diagnostic  yield  \nand that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of WGS  is at least  as high  as \nWES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is unclear  if the additional  \nyield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  outcomes.  Further,  while  \nreporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  across  laboratories,  WGS  \nresults  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of this difference  are \nuncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS reclassification  allowing  a \ndiagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the occurrence  of medical  \nmismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well defined,  and provider  \nreluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS identification  by WGS.  As \nsuch,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  utility.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  Congenital  \nAnomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup.  \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible.  Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  The \nmedian  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  \ncondition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   30 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  in several  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective.  Studies  are described  in Table  13. The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has \nbeen  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  studies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  \npopulations  and include  little  information  about  associated  changes  in management  following  genetic  \ndiagnosis.  \nTable  13.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WGS  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nA genetic  diagnosis  for an unexplained  disorder  can alter  management  in several  ways:  such  a diagnosis  \nmay  lead  to genetic  counseling  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and may  affect  reproductive  decision  \nmaking.  \nBecause  the clinical  validity  of WGS  for this indication  has not been  established,  a chain  of evidence  \ncannot  be constructed.  \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nWhole  genome  sequencing  has also been  studied  in children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  \nthan  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  \nfollowing  standard  workup.  The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has been  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  \nstudies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  populations  and include  little  information  about  \nassociated  changes  in management  following  genetic  diagnosis.  \nRapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of rapid  WES  (rWES)  or rWGS  in critically  ill patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of \nunknown  etiology  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of \nthe genome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe most  common  cause  of death  in neonates  in the United  States  is genetic  disorders.  Currently,  \ncritically  ill neonates  with  suspected  genetic  diseases  are frequently  discharged  or deceased  without  a \ndiagnosis.  There  are thousands  of rare genetic  disorders.  The presentation  of many  of these  disorders  in \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   34 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nneonates  may  be nonspecific  or differ  from  the presentation  in older  patients  and the disorder  may  \nproduce  secondary  involvement  of other  systems  due to the fragility  of the neonate  that obscures  the \nprimary  pathology.  The neonatal  intensive  care  unit (NICU)  treatment  of suspected  genetic  diseases  is \noften  empirical.  Rapid  diagnosis  is critical  for delivery  of interventions  that reduce  morbidity  and \nmortality  in genetic  diseases  for which  treatments  exist.  For many  genetic  diseases  there  is no effective  \ntreatment  and timely  diagnosis  limits  futile  intensive  care.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is critically  ill infants  presenting  with  any of a variety  of disorders  and \nanomalies  suspected  to have  a genetic  basis  but not explained  by a standard  workup.  For example,  \npatients  may  have  a phenotype  that does  not correspond  with  a specific  disorder  for which  a genetic  \ntest targeting  a specific  gene  is available.  Specifically  for critically  ill infants,  the population  would  also \ninclude  patients  for whom  specific  diagnostic  tests  available  for that phenotype  are not accessible  within  \na reasonable  timeframe.  Petrikin  (2018)  identified  critically  ill infants  that are appropriate  for rapid  \ntesting  as meeting  the following  inclusion  criteria:  multiple  congenital  anomalies;  an abnormal  \nlaboratory  test suggests  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype;  an abnormal  response  to \nstandard  therapy  for a major  underlying  condition;  significant  hypotonia;  or persistent  seizures.  \nExclusion  criteria  included:  an infection  with  normal  response  to therapy;  isolated  prematurity;  isolated  \nunconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia;  Hypoxic  Ischemic  Encephalopathy;  confirmed  genetic  diagnosis  \nexplains  illness;  Isolated  Transient  Neonatal  Tachypnea;  or nonviable  neonates.53, \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  \n• rapid  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible  \n• rapid  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible  \nSeveral  laboratories  offer  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rWES  or \nrWGS  or standard  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nIn its 2021  guideline,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  defines  rapid  and \nultrarapid  testing  as 6 to 15 days  and 1 to 3 days,  respectively.54, \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WES  or WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  \ndiagnosis  or screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  a standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  \ngenetic  condition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nOutcomes  of interest  are as described  above  for use of WES  in patients  with  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder.  For critically  ill infants,  rapid  diagnosis  is important;  \ntherefore,  in addition  to the outcomes  described  in the previous  section,  time  to diagnosis  and time  to \ndischarge  are also outcomes  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   35 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOf course,  mortality  is a compelling  outcome.  However,  many  of the conditions  are untreatable  and \ndiagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care  but may  not \nprolong  survival.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of rWES  or rWGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rWES  or rWGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of rWES  and rWGS  has been  studied  in critically  ill children  in multiple  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective,  and in 3 RCTs.  Studies  are described  in Table  16. The RCTs  are \ndiscussed  in more  detail  in the following  ‘clinically  useful’  section.  One study  included  only  infants  with  \ncardiac  defects  and had a diagnostic  yield  of 6% with  WGS.  The remaining  studies  included  \nphenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill infants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%.  \nTable  16.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials.  \nRandomized  Controlled  Trials  \nThree  RCTs  have  evaluated  rWGS  or rWES  in critically  ill infants  or children.  \nKingsmore  et al (2019)  reported  early  results  of A Randomized,  Blinded,  Prospective  Study  of the Clinical  \nUtility  of Rapid  Genomic  Sequencing  for Infants  in the Acute -care  Setting  (NSIGHT2)  trial66,. NSIGHT2  was \na randomized,  controlled,  blinded  trial of the effectiveness  of rapid  whole -genome  or -exome  \nsequencing  (rWGS  or rWES,  respectively)  in seriously  ill infants  with  diseases  of unknown  etiology  \nprimarily  from  the NICU,  pediatric  intensive  care  unit (PICU),  and cardiovascular  intensive  care  unit \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   42 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n(CVICU)  at a single  hospital  in San Diego.  Details  of the study  are provided  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. Ninety -five infants  were  randomized  to rWES  and 94 to rWGS.  In addition,  24 infants  \nwho  were  gravely  ill received  ultrarapid  WGS  (urWGS).  The initial  Kingsmore  et al (2019)  publication  \nincluded  only  the diagnostic  outcomes.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. 20%,  \nrespectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  Although  the urWGS  was not part of the \nrandomized  portion  of the study,  the proportion  diagnosed  by urWGS  was 11 of 24 (46%)  and time  to \nresult  was a median  of 4.6 days.  The incremental  diagnostic  yield  of reflexing  to trio testing  after  \ninconclusive  proband  analysis  was 0.7%  (1 of 147).  In 2020,  Dimmock  et al reported  results  of the \nprimary  endpoint  of NSIGHT2:  clinician  perception  that rWGS  was useful  and clinician -reported  changes  \nin management.67, Clinicians  provided  perceptions  of the clinical  utility  of diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  \nfor 201 of 213 infants  randomized  (94%).  In 154 (77%)  infants,  diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  was \nperceived  to be useful  or very  useful;  perceptions  of usefulness  did not differ  between  infants  who  \nreceived  rWES  and rWGS,  nor between  urWGS  and rWES/rWGS.  Thirty -two (15%)  of 207 clinician  \nresponses  indicated  that diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  changed  infant  outcomes  (by targeted  \ntreatments  in 21 [10%]  infants,  avoidance  of complications  in 16 [8%],  and institution  of palliative  care  in \n2 [1%]  infants).  Changes  in outcome  did not differ  significantly  between  infants  randomized  to rWES  and \nrWGS,  although  urWGS  was associated  with  a significantly  higher  rate of change  in management  than  \nrWES/rWGS  (63%  vs. 23%;  p=.0001).  \nPetrikin  et al (2018)  reported  on the Prospective  Randomized  Trial  of the Clinical  Utility  of Rapid  Next  \nGeneration  Sequencing  in Acutely  Ill Neonates  (NSIGHT1;  NCT02225522)  RCT of rWGS  to diagnose  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants.53, In brief,  NSIGHT1  was an investigator -initiated  \n(funded  by the National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute  and Eunice  Kennedy  Shriver  National  \nInstitute  of Child  Health  and Human  Development),  blinded,  and pragmatic  trial comparing  trio rWGS  \nwith  standard  genetic  tests  to standard  genetic  tests  alone  with  a primary  outcome  of the proportion  of \nNICU/PICU  infants  receiving  a genetic  diagnosis  within  28 days.  Parents  of patients  and clinicians  were  \nunblinded  after  10 days  and compassionate  cross -over  to rWGS  occurred  in 5 control  patients.  The study  \nwas designed  to enroll  500 patients  in each  group  but was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on \nthe part of study  clinicians  who  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus \ntrio rWGS.  Intention -to-treat  analyses  were  reported,  i.e., crossovers  were  included  in the group  to \nwhich  they  were  randomized.  The trial required  confirmatory  testing  of WGS  results,  which  lengthened  \nthe time  to rWGS  diagnosis  by 7 to 10 days.  Study  characteristics  are shown  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. \nIn the NICUSeq  RCT,  Krantz  et al (2021)  compared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  \nreporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  \nunit (ICU)  with  a suspected  genetic  disease  at 5 sites  in the US.68, In 76%  of cases,  both  parents  were  \navailable  for trio testing.  Overall,  82 of 354 infants  received  a diagnosis  (23%),  with  a higher  yield  in the \n15-day group  (Table  19). The primary  outcome  was change  in management,  measured  at day 60. \nSignificantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  the delayed  \narm (21.1%  vs 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Changes  in management  included  \nsubspecialty  referral  (21 of 354,  6.0%),  changes  to medication  (5 of 354,  1.4%),  therapeutics  specific  to \nthe primary  genetic  etiology  (7 of 354;  2.0%)  and surgical  interventions  (12 of 354;  3.4%).  Survival  and \nlength  of stay did not differ  between  the groups.  \nTable  19.

Studies  on rWGS  report  changes  in management  that would  improve  health  \noutcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as those  with  WES,  including  \navoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  discontinuation  of or \nadditional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  A chain  of evidence  linking  \nmeaningful  improvements  in diagnostic  yield  and changes  in management  expected  to improve  health  \noutcomes  supports  the clinical  value  of WES  and WGS  for critically  ill infants.  \nSection  Summary:  Rapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nFor critically  ill infants,  disease  may  progress  rapidly  and genetic  diagnoses  must  be made  quickly.  \nSeveral  retrospective  and prospective  observational  studies  with  sample  sizes  ranging  from  about  20 to \nmore  than  275 (in total  including  more  than  450 critically  ill infants  or children)  reported  on diagnostic  \nyield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse,  but critically  ill, infants  and had \nyields  between  30%  and 60%  and reports  of changes  in management  such  as avoidance  of invasive  \nprocedures,  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  \ncare.  \nThree  RCTs  have  evaluated  rWGS  in critically  ill infants  or children.  An RCT comparing  trio rWGS  with  \nstandard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants  funded  by the \nNational  Institutes  of Health  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on the part of study  clinicians  \nwho  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus trio rWGS.  The rate of \ngenetic  diagnosis  within  28 days  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; \np=.003)  and the time  to diagnosis  was shorter  (13 days  vs. 107 days;  p=.002).  The age at hospital  \ndischarge  and mortality  rates  were  similar  in the 2 groups.  However,  many  of the conditions  are \nuntreatable  and diagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care,  \nbut may  not prolong  survival.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill infants  with  diseases  \nof unknown  etiology  from  the NICU,  PICU,  and CVICU.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was \nsimilar  (19%  vs. 20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT \ncompared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  \nreturned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an ICU with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  \nSummary  of Evidence  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  receive  whole  \nexome  sequencing  (WES)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  large  case  series  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   47 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nwithin -subject  comparisons.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in \nreproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  Patients  who  have  multiple  congenital  anomalies  \nor a developmental  disorder  with  a suspected  genetic  etiology,  but whose  specific  genetic  alteration  is \nunclear  or unidentified  by a standard  clinical  workup,  may  be left without  a clinical  diagnosis  of their  \ndisorder,  despite  a lengthy  diagnostic  workup.  For a substantial  proportion  of these  patients,  WES  may  \nreturn  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  Several  large  and smaller  series  have  reported  diagnostic  yields  of \nWES  ranging  from  25%  to 60%,  depending  on the individual’s  age,  phenotype,  and previous  workup.  \nOne comparative  study  found  a 44%  increase  in yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Many  \nof the studies  have  also reported  changes  in patient  management,  including  medication  changes,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  The \nevidence  is sufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  \nreceive  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  small  case  series  and prospective  \nresearch  studies.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  \ndecision  making,  and resource  utilization.  There  is an increasing  number  of reports  evaluating  the use of \nWES  to identify  a molecular  basis  for disorders  other  than  multiple  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders.  The diagnostic  yields  in these  studies  range  from  as low as 3% to 60%.  \nSome  studies  have  reported  on the use of a virtual  gene  panel  with  restricted  analysis  of disease -\nassociated  genes,  and WES  data  allow  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  \nOverall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  disorder,  and clinical  use of WES  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  changes  in patient  management.  The \nevidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES  who  receive  repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of \nprevious  test results,  the evidence  includes  nonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  There  is no direct  evidence  of clinical  utility.  In a meta -analysis  of nonrandomized  studies,  re-\nanalysis  of WES  data  resulted  in an 11%  increase  in diagnostic  yield  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI), 8% to \n14%)  in individuals  who  were  previously  undiagnosed  via WES.  Three  nonrandomized  studies  published  \nafter  the meta -analysis  had findings  consistent  with  the meta -analysis.  Conclusions  were  limited  by \nheterogeneity  across  individual  studies  and a lack of detailed  reporting  on reasons  for new  diagnoses,  \nchanges  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the frequency  of the identification  of variants  of \nuncertain  significance  (VUS).  Therefore,  a chain  of evidence  for clinical  utility  cannot  be established.  \nAdditionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  established,  and there  are no clear  \nguidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  testing.  The evidence  is insufficient  to \ndetermine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  or WES  who  \nreceive  whole  genome  sequencing  (WGS)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  \nnonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  \noutcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  In studies  of children  with  \ncongenital  anomalies  and developmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  clinical  workup,  \nthe yield  of WGS  has ranged  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for \ninterpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the \ndiagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  In a systematic  review,  the pooled  (9 \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   48 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nstudies,  N=648)  diagnostic  yield  of WGS  was 40%  (95%  CI, 32%  to 49%).  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of \nWGS  is at least  as high  as WES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is \nunclear  if the additional  yield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  \noutcomes.  Further,  while  reporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  \nacross  laboratories,  WGS  results  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of \nthis difference  are uncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS \nreclassification  allowing  a diagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the \noccurrence  of medical  mismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well \ndefined,  and provider  reluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS \nidentification  by WGS.  As such,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  \nutility.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the \nnet health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  who  receive  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  case  series.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has also been  studied  in other  genetic  conditions  with  yield  \nranging  from  9% to 55%.  Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  \ndisorder,  and clinical  use of WGS  as well as information  regarding  meaningful  changes  in management  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  \nresults  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are critically  ill infants  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  \nfollowing  a standard  workup  who  receive  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  or rapid  WES  (rWES)  with  trio testing  when  \npossible,  the evidence  includes  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and case  series.  Relevant  outcomes  \nare test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  \nOne RCT comparing  rWGS  with  standard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in \ncritically  ill infants  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise.  The rate of genetic  diagnosis  within  28 \ndays  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; p=.003).  Changes  in \nmanagement  due to test results  were  reported  in 41%  (p=.11)  of rWGS  versus  21%  of control  patients;  \nhowever,  73%  of control  subjects  received  broad  genetic  tests  (e.g., next -generation  sequencing  panel  \ntesting,  WES,  or WGS)  as part of standard  testing.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill \ninfants  with  diseases  of unknown  etiology  from  the neonatal  intensive  care  unit,  pediatric  intensive  care  \nunit,  and cardiovascular  intensive  care  unit.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. \n20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT compared  rWGS  \n(test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 \ndays)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  unit with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Several  retrospective  \nand prospective  studies  including  more  than  800 critically  ill infants  and children  in total  have  reported  \non diagnostic  yield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill \ninfants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%  for pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants.  Studies  \nhave  also reported  associated  changes  in patient  management  for patients  receiving  a diagnosis  from  \nrWGS  or rWES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.

Priority  will be given  to guidelines  that are \ninformed  by a systematic  review,  include  strength  of evidence  ratings,  and include  a description  of \nmanagement  of conflict  of interest.  \nAmerican  Academy  of Neurology  et al \nIn 2014,  the American  Academy  of Neurology  and American  Association  of Neuromuscular  and \nElectrodiagnostic  Medicine  issued  evidence -based  guidelines  on the diagnosis  and treatment  of limb -\ngirdle  and distal  dystrophies,  which  made  the following  recommendations  (Table  23).69, \nTable  23. Guidelines  on Limb -Girdle  Muscular  Dystrophy  \nRecommendation  LOE \nDiagnosis   \n• For patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy,  clinicians  should  use a clinical  approach  to guide  \ngenetic  diagnosis  based  on the clinical  phenotype,  including  the pattern  of muscle  involvement,  \ninheritance  pattern,  age at onset,  and associated  manifestations  (e.g., early  contractures,  cardiac  \nor respiratory  involvement).  B \n• In patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy  in whom  initial  clinically  directed  genetic  testing  \ndoes  not provide  a diagnosis,  clinicians  may  obtain  genetic  consultation  or perform  parallel  \nsequencing  of targeted  exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -genome  screening,  or next -\ngeneration  sequencing  to identify  the genetic  abnormality.  C \nManagement  of cardiac  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  refer  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  (1) limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  \n(LGMD)1A,  LGMD1B,  LGMD1D,  LGMD1E,  LGMD2C –K, LGMD2M –P, … or (2) muscular  dystrophy  \nwithout  a specific  genetic  diagnosis  for cardiology  evaluation,  including  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  \nand structural  evaluation  (echocardiography  or cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  [MRI]),  even  \nif they  are asymptomatic  from  a cardiac  standpoint,  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• If ECG or structural  cardiac  evaluation  (e.g., echocardiography)  has abnormal  results,  or if the \npatient  has episodes  of syncope,  near -syncope,  or palpitations,  clinicians  should  order  rhythm  \nevaluation  (e.g., Holter  monitor  or event  monitor)  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  palpitations,  symptomatic  or \nasymptomatic  tachycardia  or arrhythmias,  or signs  and symptoms  of cardiac  failure  for cardiology  \nevaluation.  B \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2A,  LGMD2B,  and LGMD2L  for cardiac  \nevaluation  unless  they  develop  overt  cardiac  signs  or symptoms.  B \nManagement  of pulmonary  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  order  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  \ninspiratory/expiratory  force  in the upright  and,  if normal,  supine  positions)  or refer  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  (to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency)  in muscular  dystrophy  patients  at the \ntime  of diagnosis,  or if they  develop  pulmonary  symptoms  later  in their  course.  B \n• In patients  with  a known  high  risk of respiratory  failure  (e.g., those  with  LGMD2I  …), clinicians  \nshould  obtain  periodic  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  inspiratory/expiratory  B \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   50 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nforce  in the upright  position  and,  if normal,  in the supine  position)  or evaluation  by a \npulmonologist  to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency.  \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2B  and LGMD2L  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  unless  they  are symptomatic.  C \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  excessive  daytime  somnolence,  \nnonrestorative  sleep  (e.g., frequent  nocturnal  arousals,  morning  headaches,  excessive  daytime  \nfatigue),  or respiratory  insufficiency  based  on pulmonary  function  tests  for pulmonary  or sleep  \nmedicine  consultation  for consideration  of noninvasive  ventilation  to improve  quality  of life.

States  can define  EHBs  for their  respective  state.  \nStates  vary  on how  they  define  the term  small  group.  In Idaho,  a small  group  employer  is defined  as an \nemployer  with  at least  two but no more  than  fifty eligible  employees  on the first day of the plan  or \ncontract  year,  the majority  of whom  are employed  in Idaho.   Large  group  employers,  whether  they  are \nself-funded  or fully  insured,  are not required  to offer  EHBs,  but may  voluntar ily offer  them.   \nThe ACA requires  any benefit  plan  offering  EHBs  to remove  all dollar  limits  for EHBs.  \nREFERENCES  \n1.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Testing of one available parent should be done if both are not \nimmediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  Duo testing is an \nalternate option (child and one parent*) if only one parent is available.   \n \n*a biological sibling may be considered as a substitute if a parent is unavailable.   \n \nRapid Sequencing \nIn the NSIGHT1 trial (Petrikin, 2018) rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS) provided time to \nprovisional diagnosis by 10 days with time to final report of approximately 17 days although the \ntrial required confirmatory testing of WGS results which lengthened the time to rWGS diagnosis \nby 7–10 days. The WGS was performed in ‘rapid run’ mode with minimum depth of 90 Gb per \ngenome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold. \nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and, in the NICU or PICU, when the \ntest is ordered but may be discharged before results are delivered. \nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using \nchromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within rWGS if the test is validated for CNV \nanalysis. \nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, include but are not \nlimited to any of the following: \n Choanal atresia \n Coloboma \n Hirschsprung disease \n Meconium ileus \n \nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic \nphenotype include, but are not limited to, any of the following: \n Abnormal newborn screen \n Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis \n Hyperammonemia \n Lactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion \n Refractory or severe hypoglycemia \n \nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include, but not limited to, any of the \nfollowing: \n Significant hypotonia \n Persistent seizures \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 4  \n Infant with high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief resolved unexplained event \n(BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features: \no Recurrent events without respiratory infection \no Recurrent witnessed seizure like events \no Required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \no Significantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate \nor lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other tests that suggest an inborn error \nof metabolism \n Significantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible \nchannelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or structural heart disease \n Family history of: \no Arrhythmia \no BRUE in sibling \no Developmental delay \no Inborn error of metabolism or genetic disease \no Long QT syndrome (LQTS) \no Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- \nor second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant \n \nBRUE \nBrief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) was previously known as apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE). In a practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is \ndefined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports \na sudden, brief (usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the \nfollowing: \n Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing \n Altered level of responsiveness \n Cyanosis or pallor \n Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia) \nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting \nan appropriate history and physical examination.  Note: More information is available at: \nhttps://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590 . \n \nGenetic Nomenclature Update \nThe Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants \nfound in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient's existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Scientific Background  \nGene  mutations  are referred  to as “germline”  if they  are within gametes  (ova  and sperm) . Therefore,  \nthese  mutations  may  be passed  on from  parent  to offspring.  There  are many  different  types  of germline  \nmutations,  such as single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs),  structural  variations  such  as deletions,  \ninversions,  or translocations,  as well as smaller  chromosomal  abnormalities  such as short  tandem  repeats,  \nor gene  fusions. M utations  may  not necessarily  result  in disease.  \nSNPs  are the most  common  type  of genetic  mutation,  such  as missense  mutations.  These mutations  are \nsingle  base -pair changes  where  one nucleotide  is replaced  with  a different  nucleotide . Millions  of \nindividual  SNPs  have  been  identified  through  genome -wide  association  studies,  with  approximately  4000  \nSNPs  with  potential  association  with  disease . Insertion/deletion  (indel)  polymorphisms  are often  a single  \nnucleotide  but may  be up to four nucleotides.  SNPs  often  lead  to frameshift  mutations,  which  can cause  \npremature  stop  codons  and the failure  of the allele . \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 4 of 10 \nStructural variations  are usually  classified  as larger than  1000 base  pairs. These  include  deletions,  \nduplications,  inversions,  translocations,  or ring chromosome  formation.  Due to the large  number  of bases  \naffected,  these  variations  may  lead  to severe  genetic  abnormalities.  For example,  a major cause  of \nDuchenne  muscular  dystrophy  is the deletion  of large  portions  of exons  (coding  portions  of genes) . The \nmost  common  structural  variation  is the copy  number  variant  (CNV),  which  refers  to differing  amounts  of \nDNA  segments  in different  individuals.  For example,  one person  may  have  three  copies  of a specific  \nsegment  whereas  another  may  only  have  two.  These variations  may  lead  to dysregulation,  gain-of-\nfunction,  or loss-of-function  of the affected  genes.  The sensitive  genes  that require  or produce  precise  \namounts  of a protein  product  tend  to suffer more  from  these  variations. \nGermline  mutations  are unique  in that the risk for certain  conditions , including  many  forms  of cancer , \nmay  be passed  from  parent  to offspring. Testing  for these conditions  will often  involve  testing  entire  \nfamilies  if one member  is found to have  a germline  mutation ; for example,  the National Comprehensive  \nCancer  Network  (NCCN ) guidelines  for hereditary  cancer  recommend  testing  for BRCA 1/2, CDH1,  PALB2,  \nPTEN  and TP53  mutations  if any blood  relative  has a known or likely  pathogenic  variant  in a cancer  \nsusceptibility  gene . Wilson  e t  al. (2020)  estimate  that 21,800 adult  survivors  of childhood  cancer in the \nUnited  States  carry  a pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variant  in one of 156 cancer  predisposition  genes.  \n \nOther  types  of mutations  are unique  to germline  mutations.  Errors  in chromosome  number  (aneuploidy)  \nare typically  caused  by non- disjunctions  in meiosis, causing  either  a monosomic  (one  chromosome)  or a \ntrisomic  (three  chromosomes)  set of chromosomes.  Some  aneuploidies , trisomy  21, or Down  Syndrome , \nbeing  most  notable , are compatible  with  life. Aneuploidies  may  also result  with  sex chromosomes,  \nresulting  in conditions  such as Turner’s  Syndrome  (one  X chromosome)  or Klinefelter’s  Syndrome  (XXY).  \nAny size mutation  may  be pathogenic  and must  be classified  as to how  likely  they  are to cause  disease. \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  (ACMG ) has classified  mutations  in five \ncategories,  which  are as follows:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  uncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and \nbenign.  The “likely  pathogenic”  and “likely  benign”  refer to weaker  evidence  than  their  respective  \npathogenic  and benign categories,  and “uncertain  significance”  refers  to evidence  that does  not meet  \ncriteri a for benignity  or pathogenicity  or has conflicting  evidence  from  both  sides.  Prediction  algorithms  \nhave  been used to interpret  variants  and to predict  whether  a variant  will affect  the gene  function or \nsplicing  of the gene.  These  algorithms  are publicly  available  but have  a tendency  of predicting  harmful \nimpact  of a variant.  The specificity  of these  databases  has been estimated  at 60-80%.  \nDue to t he  enormous  number  of variants,  as well as the rate that variants  are discovered,  comprehensive  \ndatabases  of genetic  variants  have  been published and are easily  available. For example,  the Haplotype  \nReference  Consortium  contains  over  40 million  identified  SNPs . Databases  focusing on cancer -specific  \nvariants,  reference  sequences , and the general  population  are all available  publicly.   \nFor many  years,  single -gene  testing  was the standard  approach  for germline  mutation  testing.  In recent  \nyears,  multigene  panel  testing  (MGPT)  has been introduced and widely  accepted  as the first-tier test.  \nMGPT  increases  the probability  of identifying  pathogenic  mutations  and represents  an affordable  \napplication  of next -generation sequencing  (NGS)  into clinical practice.  However,  the clinical utility  of \nMGPT  is not well established,  especially  in cases  where  more  than  one pathogenic  variant  is identified.  \nThe risk for a specific  malignancy  is complex  and if a gene  panel  discovers  a mutation  incidentally,  \nmanagement  can be difficult.  Many  guidelines  call for radical  procedures  for these  disease  states  and it \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 5 of 10 \nmay  cause  unnecessary  harm  for the patient  concerned  about  predisposition  to the disease.  Additionally,  \na combination  of mutations  may  interact  to alter the profile  of the disease. For instance,  certain  \ncombinations  of mutations  may  be detrimental and increase  the overall  risk of cancer  malignancy,  while  \nother  combinations  may  reduce  overall  risk of malignancy.  In this regard,  identifying  clinically  actionable  \nmutations  may  be unclear  with  MGPT.   \nClinical  Utility  and Validity  \nGenetic  testing  for germline  mutations  “can be conducted  on virtually  any tissue  type, ” although  many  \nlaboratories  prefer blood  samples,  check  swabs  or saliva  samples.  Advancements  in technology  and \navailability  of sequencing,  previously  constrained by limitations  of sequential  single -gene  testing  on \nlimited  patient  samples,  have  led to significant  strides  in the understanding  of the genetic  basis  of \ninherited  and somatic  conditions.   \nVariants  detected  by genetic  testing  include  inherited  germline  variants  and somatic  mutations ; next  \ngeneration  sequencing (NGS)  has allowed  for superior  detection  for these  mutations.  The accuracy  of \nNGS  varies  depending on how  many  genes  are sequenced;  fewer  genes  tend  to result  in higher  accuracy  \nsince  there  will be more  “probe -template  overlap .” Although Sanger  sequencing  remains  the most  \naccurate  at >99.99%  accuracy,  it cannot  sequence  a large  quantity  of genes  in a timely  fashion  and is best  \nused  for sequencing  of a specific  gene.  Pogoda  et al. (2019)  identified  rare variants  in the ATM  gene by \nusing single molecule Molecular Inversion Probes (smMIPSs) , an NGS -based screening method . A total \nof 373 patients with dystonia and six positive controls with previously identified ATM  variants \nparticipated in this study. Results generated by the smMIPs  “produced similar results as routinely used \nNGS -based approaches ” (Pogoda et al., 2019) . This suggests that ATM  screening should be routinely \nused when genetic testing dystonia patients.  Further, smMIPs may be an important technique for the \ngermline screening for all rare neurodegenerative disorders.  \nThe c linical  validity  of a genetic  test depends  primarily  on the expressivity  and penetrance  of a given  \nphenotype.  Penetrance  refers  to the likelihood  of developing  a disease  when the pathogenic  mutation  is \npresent,  and expressivity  refers  to the variations  in the way the disease  is expressed.  For example,  \nvirtually  any mutation  in the APC gene  will cause  symptoms  of familial  adenomatous  polyposis,  thereby  \nincreasing  the clinical  validity  of an APC assessment  while  other  conditions  may  not clinically  manifest  at \nall despite  a mutated  genotype.   \nThe clinical  utility  of a genetic  test generally  relies  on available  treatments  for a condition.  Conditions  \nsuch  as Huntington Disease  that do not have  many  options  for treatment  will have  limited  clinical utility  \ncompared to another  condition  even  though the actual test is highly  valid.  Factors , such  as severity of the \ndisease  and management  options , affect  the clinical  utility  of a genetic  test.   \nLincoln  et al. (2020)  performed  a retrospective study  to investigate the yield  and utility  of germline  \ntesting  on cancer  patients  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing.  The authors  calculated  the prevalence  of \npathogenic  germline  variants  (PVG)  and the potential  actionability  of the PVGs  in 2023  cancer  patients . \n30.5%  (n=617)  of participants  had PVGs . Participants  with  PVGs  spanned  all ages  and cancer  types.  \nTumor  DNA  sequencing missed 8.1%  of PGVs . 11.2%  of missed  PVGs  were  only  detected  after \ndeveloping a second  primary  cancer.  The results  suggest  that missed PVGs  could  have  been  detected  \nearlier and the second  cancer  could  have  been  treated  earlier or prevented.  The authors  concluded  \nthat germline  testing  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing can result  in important  findings  that can impact  \npatient  care.  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 6 of 10 \nVI. Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular \nPathology  (AMP)   \nThe ACMG and AMP released criteria on the types and severity of mutations, which are as follows:  \n• Very strong evidence of pathogenicity : Null variants (nonsense, frameshifts, canonical +/ - 1-2 splice \nsites, initiation codon, exon deletions) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease. The guidelines note to use caution in genes where LOF is not a mechanism, if L OF variants \nare at the 3’ end, if exon skipping occurs, and if multiple transcripts are present.  \n• Strong: Amino acid change to a pathogenic version, de novo mutations, established studies \nsupporting a damaging gene or gene product, or if the prevalence of the variant is increased in affected individuals compared to healthy controls. The guidelines note to be careful of changes \nimpacting splicing and if only the paternity has been confirmed.  \n• Moderate: Located in a mutational hot spot or well- established functional domain (e.g., active site \nof an enzyme) without a benign variation, absent from controls in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium, detected in trans  with pathogenic variants for \na recessive disorder, protein length changes, novel missense changes where a different missense \nchange has been pathogenic before, and a possible de novo mutation.  \n• Supporting: Co -segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively \nknown to cause the disease, missense variant in a gene with low rate of benign missense variation, \nif the mutation has evidence that it is deleterious, or if the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for \ndisease with a single genetic cause.  \nThe guidelines also list criteria for benign gene variants.  \n• Stand- alone evidence of benignity: Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 \nGenomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium  \n• Strong: Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder, observed in healthy adult with full \npenetrance at early age, lack of segregation in affected family members (although pathogenic variants may masquerade as nonsegregated), or well -established studies that show no damaging \neffect on protein production.  \n• Supporting: Missense variant of a gene for which truncating mutations are pathogenic, indels in \nrepetitive region of unknown function, silent variants, variants of unknown significance, or a trans  \nversion of a cis mutation.  \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN)   \nMultiple germline  mutations have been incorporated into the diagnostic workups recommended by the \nNCCN. Furthermore, the NCCN has several guidelines which recommend that gene expression profiling, or multiple gene testing, may be helpful, more efficient and/or cost -effecti ve for selected patients. \nPlease see the individual policies.  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology  (AMP) , American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) , and College \nof American Pathologists ( CAP)  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 7 of 10 \nThe Joint Commission noted that germline variants should focus on the pathogenicity of a given variant \nrather than their impact on clinical care. The guidelines recommend reporting germline variants with known clinical impact , such as BRCA1  or 2. A genetic counseling recommendation should also be \nprovided if a pathogenic germline mutation is found.  \nThe guidelines note that it is critical to identify a somatic vs a germline mutation as the type of mutation \nmay have significant clinical consequences . \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology  (ASCO)   \nThe ASCO published guidelines regarding genetic and genomic testing for cancer susceptibility. These guidelines state that  the “ASCO recognizes that concurrent multigene testing (ie, panel testing) may be \nefficient in circumstances that require evaluation of multiple high -penetrance genes of established \nclinical utility as possible explanations for a patient’s personal or family history of cancer. Depending on the specific genes included on the panel employed, panel testing may also identify mutations in genes associat ed with moderate or low cancer risks and mutations in high -penetrance genes that would not \nhave been evaluated on  the basis of the presenting personal or family history… ASCO affirms that it is \nsufficient for cancer risk assessment to evaluate genes of established clinical utility that are suggested by the patient’s personal and/or family history .” \nASCO released guidelines regarding germline testing for ovarian  cancer. ASCO recommends that “ all \nwomen diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer should be offered germline genetic testing for BRCA1, \nBRCA2 , and other ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, irrespective of their clinical features or family \ncancer history. In addition, “first - or second -degree blood relatives of a patient with ovarian cancer with \na known germline pathogenic cancer susceptibility  gene mutation or variant should be offered \nindividualized genetic risk evaluation, counseling, and genetic testing.” Lastly, “ clinical decisions should \nnot be based on a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).” In this case, the patient’s clinical features and family history should be taken into consideration and should inform clinical decision making.  \nVII.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental\ndisorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WGS with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes case series.\nRelevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants.

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

If the individual with\ncancer has pancreatic cancer or prostate cancer (metastatic or intraductal/cribriform or high-risk group or very-high-risk group) then only first-\ndegree relatives should be of fered testing unless there are other family history indications for testing.\nAn individual with any type of cancer (cancer related to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome but not meeting above criteria, or\ncancer unrelated to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome) or unaf fected individual who otherwise does not meet the criteria above\nbut has a probability >5% of a BRCA1/2  or PALB2  pathogenic variant based on prior probability models (eg, Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPro, Pennll).\nGenetic testing for BRCA 1 and BRCA2  variants of cancer-af fected individuals or cancer-unaf fected individuals with a family history of cancer when\ncriteria above are not met is considered investigational .\nTesting for PALB2  variants in individuals who do not meet the criteria outlined above is considered investigational .\nGenetic testing in minors for BRCA1,  BRCA2,  and PALB2  variants for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is considered investigational\n(see Policy Guidelines).\n \nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nPlans may need to alter local coverage medical policy to conform to state law regarding coverage of biomarker testing.\nThere are dif ferences in the position statements above and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline on Genetic/Familial High-\nRisk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic ( v .3.2024). Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for determining hereditary breast and\novarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy . Testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all\nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years, may be indicated for\nguiding cancer therapies. Genetic testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in breast cancer-, pancreatic cancer-, prostate cancer-, or ovarian cancer-\naffected individuals who are considering systemic therapy is addressed separately in evidence reviews 2.04.151, 2.04.148, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156,\nrespectively . Genetic testing for PALB2  variants in pancreatic cancer-af fected individuals is also addressed in 2.04.148. Additionally , conflicting criteria\nreflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited or no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of\ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.\nCurrent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation. W omen with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should\nreceive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant. In addition, there are potential harms related to stigmatization and discrimination. See policy 2.04.128 regarding testing of BRCA1 , BRCA2,\nand PALB2  for Fanconi anemia. See policies 2.04.148, 2.04.151, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156 regarding genetic testing to guide targeted therapy .\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nProstate Cancer\nIndividuals with BRCA  or PALB2  variants have an increased risk of prostate cancer , and individuals with known BRCA  or PALB2  variants may ,\ntherefore, consider more aggressive screening approaches for prostate cancer .\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine T umors\nCurrent NCCN guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( v .2.2024) refers to the NCCN guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk assessment of breast,\novarian, and pancreatic cancers detailed above, and state: \"The panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer\nand in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for inherited susceptibility .\" The panel recommends \"using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary\ncancer syndromes.\"89,\nThe NCCN guidelines for genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers ( v .3.2024) states that germline testing is\nclinically indicated for individuals with neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers per the NCCN guidelines on neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors.90, The\nNCCN guidelines for neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors ( v .1.2024) states, \"consider genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing: In a patient with\nduodenal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at any age\", noting, \"studies of unselected patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have identified\ngermline variants in 16%-17% of cases. However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result\non the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).

Policy Description  \n \nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is the strategy of using next -generation technology to sequence the \nentire genome. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) refers to sequencing of the exome, the component of \nthe genome that predominantly encode proteins. Next generation  sequencing (NGS) involves \nsequencing of multiple small fragments of DNA in parallel, producing fast, accurate sequencing results \n(Hulick, 2024).  \n \nThis policy is applicable for undiagnosed rare germline disorders.  \n \nII. Indications and/or Limitations of Coverage  \n \nApplication of coverage criteria is dependent upon an individual’s benefit coverage at the time of the \nrequest.

Scientific Background   \nDNA sequencing is a critical tool for the evaluation of many medical conditions. The two primary \nmethods of DNA sequencing in the clinical setting are Sanger sequencing and next -generation \nsequencing or NGS. NGS is a technique that allows for the rapid seq uencing of multiple strands of DNA. \nIt is not limited to one specific type of test; rather it encompasses numerous technologies that produce \nswift and high -volume sequencing. NGS can be used to sequence larger sequences, such as the exome \nor the entire gen ome. This is opposed to the traditional Sanger sequencing, which is more useful for \nsequencing a specific gene (Hulick, 2024) . \nThe NGS procedure typically includes the following steps: first the patient’s DNA is prepared to serve as \na template, then DNA fragments are isolated (on solid surfaces such as small beads) where sequence \ndata is generated. Then these results are compared against a reference genome. Any DNA sample may \nbe used if the quality and quantity of that sample is sufficient, but the methods of library generation and \ndata analysis often vary from panel to panel. Evaluating the results of a gene panel typically requir es \nexpertise in bioinformatics. Since NGS reports data on any variants found, great care must be taken to \nevaluate these gene variants, especially variants of unknown significance (VUS) and secondary findings \n(Hulick, 2024; Rehm et al., 2013) .  \nExome and genome sequencing are usually performed with NGS. The exome represents all the protein -\nencoding genes, and at least 85% of pathogenic mutations are found in the exome. Further, the exome \nonly comprises approximately 1.5% -2% of the genome, thereby  making it more cost effective to \nsequence than whole genome sequencing. The entire exome includes approximately 30 megabases \ncompared to the genome’s 3.3 gigabases. However, sequencing an entire genome may be useful as a \npathogenic mutation may be in a no ncoding region of the genome, such as gene regulation dysfunction. \nMost clinical NGS testing uses targeted panels or whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) is only used in select cases. For instance, conditions such as nonsyndromic  hearing \nloss (possible pathogenic variants in over 60 genes) may benefit from WES evaluation (Hulick, 2024) .  \nSeveral companies have pivoted towards focused exome sequencing. These are panels tailored to \nindividual phenotypes and target a maximum number of genes depending on the company. There is a \n>30% diagnostic yield, with freedom for clinicians to choose speci fic genes they are interested in, with \nreduced cost and options to reflex to WES for negative cases (GGC, 2022) . In their study, Jia et al. (2023)  \nretrospectively analyzed 372 pediatric patients who were referred to clinically focused exome \nsequencing (CFES), and concluded that CFES may be first -line for “diagnosing young children with \nsuspected genetic conditions, as it validates the identification  of molecular genetics alterations and \nfacilitates comprehensive medical management. The patients that were more likely to receive diagnoses \nvia CFES were those with “metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities, craniofacial /otolaryngology/ \nophthalmologic abnorm alities, and/or [abnormalities of] the integument” (Jia et al., 2023) . Despite the \nnovelty and expected benefits of focused exome sequencing, more clinical studies with larger sample \nsizes are necessary.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 8 of 25 \n \nProprietary Testing  \nMany proprietary technologies for WES and WGS are available. Companies such as Variantyx provide \nhighly specialized genetic testing to patients and clinicians. The Genomic Unity® Exome Plus Analysis test \nsequences the exome, including intronic and regulato ry variants, identifies disease causing deletions or \nduplications in the genome, and analyzes the mitochondrial genome with heteroplasmy (≥5%). This test \nmay identify many genes for a variety of disorders including AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, \nATXN8OS, ATXN10, C9ORF72, CACNA1A, CNBP, CSTB, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, JPH3, NOP56, \nNOTCH2NLC, PABPN1, PPP2R2B, TBP  (for adult -onset movement disorders), AFF2, DIP2B, FMR1  (for \nearly -onset intellectual disability disorders), and PHOX2B, TCF4  (for other disorders) (variantyx, 2020) . \nThis test requires either a blood, saliva or gDNA (genomic DNA) sample and has an eight -week \nturnaround time.  \nClinical Utility and Validity  \nAlfares et al. (2018)  compared the cost -effectiveness and clinical utility of both WES and WGS. Data was \nanalyzed from 108 participants; all 108 individuals had negative array comparative genomic \nhybridization (also known as chromosomal microarray) results and negative or inco nclusive WES results \nbefore WGS was performed. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is another common genetic testing \nmethod that can analyze many pieces of DNA simultaneously. The authors only pinpointed three positive \ncases where WGS identified a genetic or inhe rited disorder that WES did not recognize; further, it was \nnoted that “30% of the positive cases identified by WGS could be identified by reanalyzing the WES raw \ndata, and WGS achieved an only 7% higher detection rate. Therefore, until the cost of WGS appr oximates \nthat of WES, reanalyzing WES raw data is recommended before performing WGS” (Alfares et al., 2018) . \nYang et al. (2014)  conducted a single -center observational study of 2000 patients with clinical whole \nexome sequencing performed for a suspected genetic disorder. A molecular diagnosis was reported for \n504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously  reported. The investigators \nconcluded that “the yield of whole -exome sequencing may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients” (Yang et al., 2014) . Best et al. (2018)  reviewed 31 different \nWES studies and noted that the diagnostic rates varied between 6.2% and 80%; however, the \nresearchers state that the “differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to \nsequencing largely account for the wide r ange of diagnostic rates.”  \nTammimies et al. (2015)  evaluated the molecular diagnostic yield of CMA and WES in children with \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD). The patient cohort included 258 consecutively enrolled unrelated \nchildren with ASD, stratified into three groups based on the presence of major congen ital abnormalities \nand minor physical anomalies. All probands underwent CMA, with WES performed for 95 proband -\nparent trios. The molecular diagnostic yields of CMA and WES were comparable. Among the 95 patients \nundergoing WES, eight  children (8.4%)  received an ASD -related molecular diagnosis. Among the children \nwho underwent both CMA and WES testing, the estimated proportion with an identifiable genetic \netiology was 15.8%. The investigators concluded that “if replicated in additional  populations, these \nfindings may inform appropriate selection of molecular diagnostic testing for children affected by ASD” \n(Tammimies et al., 2015) . A similar study was performed by Arteche -López et al. (2021)  to validate WES \nas a “first -tier test for the genetic diagnosis of [ASD], when there is no suspicion of fragile X syndrome.” \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 9 of 25 \n \nUpon comparing the clinical utility of CMA, FMR1  testing, and WES testing, the researchers “achieved a \nglobal diagnostic rate of 12.8% (44/343), the majority of them being characterised by WES (33/44; 75%) \ncompared to CMA (9/44; 20.4%) or  FMR1  testing (2/44; 4.5%),” evidently demonstrating the “higher \ndiagnostic power” of WES compared to CMA (Arteche -López et al., 2021) . \nTaylor et al. (2015)  performed whole genome sequencing in 217 individuals across a broad spectrum of \ngenetic disorders in whom previous screening had identified no pathogenic variants. Disease -causing \nvariants were identified in 21% of cases, with the proportion increasing to  34% (23/68) for mendelian \ndisorders and 57% (8/14) in family trios. The investigators concluded that the results “demonstrate the \nvalue of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding \nchallenges” (Taylor et al., 2015) . \nMiller et al. (2017)  performed exome/whole genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause in patients \nwith craniosynostosis, in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative. Out of the 40 \npatients’ tests, associated mutations were identified in 15 patients (37.5%) involving 14 different genes. \nIn five of the 15 positive cases, the molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences in \npatient management. The investigators concluded that “the benefits of exome/whole genome \nsequencing to identify causal  mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has \nyielded negative results” (Miller et al., 2017) . \nCrowley et al. (2020)  used WES in a single -center cohort study of 1005 pediatric IBD patients and found \na 3% prevalence of damaging variants in genes linked to monogenic IBD, and that 1% of monogenic \npediatric IBD patients have variants in genes associated with primary immunod eficiency that are \npotentially curable through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As rare genetic variants \ncould manifest in different phenotypes, the researchers believe that the “data supports the diagnosis of \nmonogenic disease beyond th e very early onset IBD population especially in children with a family \nhistory of autoimmune diseases and those with evidence of extra -intestinal manifestations of IBD” and \nthat WES will lend itself to provide definitive and personalized treatments in the future (Crowley et al., \n2020) . \nSrivastava et al. (2014)  conducted a retrospective cohort study on 78 children with neurodevelopmental \ndisabilities and a prior unrevealing workup before WES. The overall presumptive diagnostic testing rate \nwas 41% (32/78 patients). Results of WES affected patient management in a ll cases, most often related \nto reproductive planning (27/78). The investigators concluded that the high diagnostic yield of WES \ncould lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning \n(Srivastava et al., 2014) . \nHaskell et al. (2018)  studied the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in the evaluation of \nneuromuscular disorders. A total of 93 undiagnosed patients with potential neuromuscular disorders \nparticipated in this study; the diagnostic yield of these 93 patients with exome seq uencing was 12.9% \n“with one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in a causative gene associated with \nthe patient's disorder” (Haskell et al., 2018) . In this study, exome sequencing was able to provide or \nclarify a neuromuscular disorder diagnosis, but only in a small percentage of the population studied.  \nInvolving WGS or WES as a supplemental level of evaluation has been able to effect change in medical \ncare and treatment pathways. In the NIH -funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, among 382 patients \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 10 of 25 \n \nwith complete evaluations, “28 (21%) of the patients who received a diagnosis, the diagnosis led to a \nrecommendation regarding a change in therapy. In 49 (37%), the diagnosis led to a change in care other \nthan therapy, such as the narrowing of diagnostic t esting. In 48 (36%), the diagnosis led to variant -\nspecific genetic counseling but did not lead to a change in the diagnostic or therapeutic strategy.” The \nchanges in therapy ranged from known drugs, vitamins, coenzyme supplementations, and transplant in \none patient. This demonstrated evidence supporting usage of DNA sequencing for genetically \ndetermined conditions and a representative lens of how it can affect medical care (Splinter et al., 2018) . \nMuthaffar (2021)  conducted a retrospective chart review for WES results between January 2018 to \nNovember 2019 for patients at a pediatric neurology clinic in Saudi Arabia to identify the utility of WES. \nIt was found that “twenty -six children with undiagnosed neurological conditions were identified and \nunderwent WES diagnosis. Nineteen patients (73.0%) of the cohort were diagnosed with pathogenic \nvariants, likely pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS).” The researcher also \nfurthered the conclusions of  the WES high diagnostic rate by proving direct implications on clinical \nmanagement based on testing results. One patient who had a positive pathogenic BTD mutation, \ndiagnosed at seven -years old with a biotinidase deficiency, was started on biotin supplements after WES \ntesting, and was able to breathe independently off a ventilator, regain motor capabilities with physical \ntherapy, improve hearing, and elimin ate convulsions (Muthaffar, 2021) . \nUsing WES on eleven probands from ten Jordanian families who have been formerly diagnosed with \nlimb -girdle dystrophy (LGMD) and Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT), Ababneh et al. (2021)  identified \na series of missense, nonsense, and deletion variants associated with neuromuscular disorders. \nConsequently, the researchers argue that “Utilization of WES is helpful to facilitate rapid and accurate \nNMDs diagnosis, complementing a thorough cli nical evaluation”, especially in a country where the risk \nof autosomal -recessive disorders is increased by consanguinity and the implementation of genetic \ndiagnosis is limited and the results misunderstood (Ababneh et al., 2021) .  \nSanford et al. (2019)  investigated the clinical utility of rWGS in children within the pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU). They were able to make a molecular diagnosis by rWGS in 17 of 38 children, and in four \nof the 17 children diagnosed by rWGS (24%), “the genetic diagnose s led to a change in management \nwhile in the PICU, including genome -informed changes in pharmacotherapy and transition to palliative \ncare… Eighty -two percent of diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient and/or family \nafter PICU discharge, i ncluding avoidance of biopsy, administration of factor replacement, and \nsurveillance for disorder -related sequelae” (Sanford et al., 2019) . In this retrospective analysis, benefits \nof rWGS were further elucidated in the setting of unknown or unclear clinical etiologies.  \nReda et al. (2020)  studied WES for metastatic solid cancer diagnoses in 506 patients. In this study, the \nsomatic and germline exome analysis was restricted to 317 specific genes. Exome sequencing was \nsuccessful in 386 tumor samples, and 342 patients received a therapeutic p roposal based on their \ngenetic results. However, only 79 patients were treated with an NGS matched therapy. While this study \nshows that WES is a possible tool to assist with metastatic solid cancer diagnoses and treatments, “no \ndifferences were observed be tween PFS [progression -free survival] ratios of patients treated with \nmatched therapy versus standard therapy” (Reda et al., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 11 of 25 \n \nOther studies have also yielded bifurcating results on the periodic revisiting of unsolved exome cases \nand for variants of unknown significance. Salfati et al. (2019)  found that re -analysis of 101 WES cases \none to seven  years after initial analysis resulted in “the identification of additional diagnostic variants in \n3 rare disease cases (5.9%) and 1 sudden unexplained death case (2%), which increased our molecular \ndiagnostic yield to 31.4% and 12%, respectively.” However,  though they recognize the importance of \nany diagnostic yield to those families potentially affected, the authors also acknowledge that “most of \nour cases remain unexplained after our re -analysis”, which they attribute to an enduring lack of coverage \nof functional exonic variants, along with “the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease that is not \neasily dissected in small families, and the possibility of disease due to epigenetic, somatic, or other \nuninterrogated genomic aberrations.” As such, “We [ the authors] suggest that a 6 -month cycle of \nautomated re -analysis could improve the pace at which new findings are disseminated to patients. \nPeriodic re -analysis by third party or other software not originally used to analyze cases is also \npotentially use ful to uncover pathogenic variants that may be missed by the differences across genome \ninterpretation platforms” (Salfati et al., 2019) .  \nParent -child Trio Testing  \nParent -child trio testing is a strategy which helps to identify single pathogenic mutations among the \nmany genomic variants in an individual. Specifically, the sequencing of both the parents and the patient \nallows for the variant to be identified easier an d “filtered based on consistency or inconsistency \naccording to the laws of Mendelian inheritance” (Sakai et al., 2013) . \nLee et al. (2014)  reported on the initial clinical indications for clinical exome sequencing (CES) referrals \nand molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and different test types. CES was performed on \n814 patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions who underwent WES. CES was conducted \nusing a trio -CES technique which involves  both parents and their affected child sequenced \nsimultaneously. Overall, a molecular diagnosis with a causative variant in a well -established clinical gene \nwas provided for 213/ 814 (26%) cases. The trio -CES was associated with a higher molecular diagnostic \nyield (31%; 127/410 cases) than proband -CES or traditional molecular diagnostic methods. The \ninvestigators concluded that “additional studies designed to validate these finding s and to explore the \neffect of this approach on clinical and economic outcomes are warranted” (Lee et al., 2014) . \nSoden et al. (2014)  performed diagnostic WGS and/or WES in parent -child trios for 100 families with 119 \nchildren with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A total of 45% of the families received molecular \ndiagnoses of an established genetic disorder (53/119 affected children) . An accelerated sequencing \nmodality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families with acutely ill children (11/15). In this study, \nWES proved to be less costly than continued conventional diagnostic testing of children with NDD in \nwhom initial testing  failed to yield a diagnosis. The investigators concluded that “initial diagnostic \nevaluation of children with NDD should include trio WGS or WES, with extension of accelerated \nsequencing modalities to high -acuity patients” (Soden et al., 2014) . \nAnother study compared fetal WES versus trio analysis WES on fetuses with sonographic abnormalities. \nThe researchers found that trio analysis yielded a positive/definitive diagnosis in 30% (3/10) of the cases \nas compared to only 14.3% (2/14) of the singlet on cases. They conclude, “In order to expedite \ninterpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 12 of 25 \n \ncompromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes” (Drury et al., 2015) . Similarly, these data are \nsupported by another study of trio analysis of thirty different cases. A total of 10% of the cases were \npositive for a pathogenic finding, and 17% were de novo, inherited recessive, or X -linked variants. The \nauthors conclude, “T his study outlines the way for a substantial improvement in the diagnostic yield of \nprenatal genetic abnormalities through the application of next -generation sequencing” (Carss et al., \n2014) . \nYates et al. (2017)  performed WES, including trio analysis, using samples obtained from deceased fetuses \nwith ultrasound anomalies. They note that 20% of cases were positive overall with a definitive diagnosis \nwith another 45% positive for possible pathogenic candidate varia nts. Comparing trio analysis to \nsingleton analysis, 24% (n=11) of trio analysis resulted in a definitive diagnostic finding versus 14% (n=3) \nfor singleton testing (Yates et al., 2017) .  \nClark et al. (2018)  compared the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and CMA in children with \nsuspected genetic disorders. Trio analyses were also analyzed. Many studies were reviewed in this meta -\nanalysis; the authors state that “In 37 studies, comprising 20,068 chi ldren, diagnostic utility of WGS \n(0.41, 95% CI 0.34 -0.48, I2 = 44%) and WES (0.36, 95% CI 0.33 -0.40, I2 = 83%) were qualitatively greater \nthan CMA (0.10, 95% CI 0.08 -0.12, I2 = 81%) (Clark et al., 2018) . Further, a statistical difference was not \nfound regarding the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS. Finally, “Subgroups with higher WGS/WES \ndiagnostic utility were trios and those receiving hospital -based interpretation. WGS/WES should be \nconsidered a first -line genomic test for children with suspected genetic diseases” (Clark et al., 2018) . \nZhang et al. (2021)  performed WES and trio analysis on 18 unrelated men who have idiopathic \nhypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), which is a rare genetic disorder that causes delayed or absent \npuberty as well as infertility due to gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) insuffi ciency/deficiency, \nand their parents. With this testing, “one reported and 10 novel variants in eight known IHH causative \ngenes ( AXL, CCDC141, CHD7, DMXL2, FGFR1, PNPLA6, POLR3A, and PROKR2 ), nine variants in nine \nrecently reported candidate genes ( DCAF17,  DCC, EGF, IGSF10, NOTCH1, PDE3A, RELN, SLIT2, and \nTRAPPC9 ), and four variants in four novel candidate genes for IHH ( CCDC88C, CDON, GADL1,  and \nSPRED3 ) were identified in 77.8% (14/18) of IHH cases.” This analysis also supported oligogenic etiology \nfor disease presentation, with 44.4% cases carrying at least two variants in IHH -related genes. They also \nfound that the variants “tended to be maternally in herited (maternal with n = 17 vs paternal with n = 7; \nP = 0.028),” which was confirmed by their previous l iterature review, and due to the presence of female \ncarriers, extends the notion that females may be more tolerant of “deleterious” IHH -related gene \nmutations. This study exemplifies the clinical utility of WES and trio analysis for reproductive genetic \ndisorders and could be used to continue pedigree analyses for IHH (Zhang et al., 2021) . \nMalcher et al. (2022)  investigated the use of whole -genome sequencing in identifying new candidate \ngenes for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). The authors applied WGS for 39 patients with NOA to \nidentify novel NOA -associated SNVs, yielding “8 potentially disease causing [sic] variants in 4 genes, \nfollowed by 30 variants in 20 genes that were previously linked to infertility, and 20 variants in 13 genes \nthat have never been investigated with respect to male infertility but could be important in patients \nwith NOA” in 29 of the 3 9 azoospermic individuals. Of these 58 variants, 16 were newly discovered and, \nas such, “highly recommended to examine their possible function and mechanism of participation in \ngametogenesis” (Malcher et al., 2022) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 13 of 25 \n \nIn their examination of whole exome and genome sequencing in a Mendelian disorder cohort, Ewans et \nal. (2022)  determined that “WGS resulted in a diagnosis in one third (34%; 13/38 families) of \nundiagnosed families who had previously had WES.” However, when adjusting for “factors such as \nimprovements to gene -disease knowledge and genomic pipelines through contempo rary WES \nreanalysis, the WGS diagnostic yield reduced to 19% (6/31 remaining families)”, primarily due to “due \nto reduced WES coverage of critical regions that may be solved through an improved WES platform.” \nSuch results contribute to the debate about the  “trade -off between the lower cost of WES and the higher \ndiagnostic yield of WGS” and will ultimately be a function of “the clinical scenario and local resourcing \nand availability” (Ewans et al., 2022) . \nV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)  \nIn 2012, the ACMG released a policy statement outlining points to consider in the clinical application of \ngenomic sequencing to the detection of germ -line mutations. The ACMG recommended that WGS/WES \nshould be considered in the clinical diagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:  \n• “The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but the phenotype \ndoes not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic test targeting a specific gene is \navailable on a clinical basis.”  \n• “A patient presents with a defined genetic disorder that demonstrates a high degree of genetic \nheterogeneity, making WES or WGS analysis of multiple genes simultaneously a more practical \napproach.”  \n• “A patient presents with a likely genetic disorder, but specific genetic tests available for that \nphenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \n• “A fetus with a likely genetic disorder in which specific genetic tests, including targeted \nsequencing tests, available for that phenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \nACMG stated that “WGS/WES may be considered in preconception carrier screening, using a strategy to \nfocus on genetic variants known to be associated with significant phenotypes in homozygous or \nhemizygous progeny.” ACMG further stated that WGS and WES shou ld not be used at this time as an \napproach to prenatal screening or as a first -tier approach for newborn screening (ACMG, 2012) . \nACMG released a guideline on informed consent for genome/exome sequencing. In that guideline, they \nnoted that WGS/WES was not recommended “before the legal age of majority” unless for “phenotype -\ndriven clinical diagnostic uses or circumstances in which ear ly monitoring or interventions are available \nand effective” (ACMG, 2013) . \nIn 2014 the ACMG published guidelines (Alford et al., 2014)  for the clinical evaluation and etiologic \ndiagnosis of hearing loss which state: “Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's \ninformed consent, genetic testing, if available, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis —this testing \nmay include single -gene tests, hearing loss  sequencing  panels,  whole -exome  sequencing(WES),  whole -\ngenome  sequencing  (WGS), chromosome analysis, or microarray -based copy -number analysis, \ndepending on clinical findings.”  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 14 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG published guidelines on the use of fetal exome sequencing (ES) in prenatal diagnoses. \nThese guidelines are  below (Monaghan et al., 2020) : \nPretest Considerations  \n• “Exome sequencing may be considered for a fetus with ultrasound anomalies when standard CMA \nand karyotype analysis have failed to yield a definitive diagnosis. If a specific diagnosis is \nsuspected, molecular testing for the suggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) \nshould be the initial test. At the present time, there are no data supporting the clinical use for ES \nfor other reproductive indications, such as the identification of sonographic markers suggestive \nof aneuploidy or a history of re current unexplained pregnancy loss.  \n• Trio analysis consisting of the proband and both biological parents is preferred to singleton (fetus \nonly) or duo (fetus and one parent) analyses. Trio analysis consistently shows higher diagnostic \nyields compared with nontrio analysis. It allows for the i mmediate identification of de novo \nvariants, determination of phase for biallelic variants, and confirmation of carrier status in both \nparents when a homozygous variant is detected. For laboratories not requiring trio analysis for \nprenatal ES, all efforts should be made to determine inheritance of identified fetal variants with \ntargeted testing of the biological parents. There may be circumstances where both biological \nparents are unable to submit specimens. In this scenario, variant segregation testing usi ng the \navailable parent or testing of other closely related family members should be considered.  \n• Pretest counseling is ideally provided by a genetics  professional during which the types of variants \nthat may be returned in a laboratory report for all tested family members would be reviewed.  \nPosttest Considerations  \n• Post -test counseling is recommended, regardless of the test result. It should be provided by \nindividuals with relevant expertise, preferably a genetics professional.  \nReanalysis Considerations  \n• For patients with initial negative ES results, reanalysis of exome sequencing data aids clinical \ndiagnosis after 12 months. This outcome has been validated in the pediatric population as \nadditional phenotypic findings might be noted during a child’s growth  and development. \nContinuous updates in database resources and new publications may provide further information \nfor variant and gene classification.  \n• Due to the discovery of new gene –disease associations (that were unknown at the time of initial \nanalysis), reanalysis can also be considered for diagnostic results and results deemed to be \npossibly (but not definitively) associated with the fetal phenotype . \n• For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, reanalysis may be considered if a new \nphenotype develops in the proband after birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant \namount of time has passed (either at the discretion of the testing lab oratory or at least 12 months) \nsince the initial testing was performed.  \n• If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time, a reanalysis could be considered” (Monaghan et \nal., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 15 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG conducted a systematic evidence review to support guideline development for the \nuse of exome and genome sequencing among patients with congenital anomalies, developmental delay, \nor intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). From their review, the  ACMG concluded, “There is evidence that \nES/GS for patients with CA/ DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision -making, which could lead \nto improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate \nevidence regar ding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients \nwith CA/DD/ID” (Malinowski et al., 2020) . \nIn 2021 the ACMG asserted that as the body of literature surrounding this continues to burgeon, it urges \nthem to “strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second -tier test (guided by clinical judgment \nand often clinician –patient/family shared decisi on making after CMA or focused testing) for patients \nwith one or more CAs prior to one year of age or for patients with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage” (Manickam et al., 2021) .  \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal and Fetal \nMedicine (SFM)  \nIn 2016 the ACOG and SFM published a joint committee opinion on “ Microarrays and Next -Generation \nSequencing Technology: The Use of Advanced Genetic Diagnostic Tools in Obstetrics and Gynecology”, \nwhich states that “the routine use of whole -genome or whole -exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis \nis not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer reviewed data and \nvalidation studies are published” (ACOG & SFM, 2016) .  \nHowever, ACOG and SFM note that WES may be considered when “specific genetic tests available for a \nphenotype, including targeted sequencing tests, have failed to determine a diagnosis in a fetus with \nmultiple congenital anomalies suggestive of a genetic di sorder.” The guideline further clarifies that “in \nselect circumstances (recurrent or lethal fetal anomalies in which other approaches have been \nnoninformative), [WES] may be considered as a diagnostic tool, but only after other appropriate testing \nhas been  noninformative and after extensive counseling by an [OB -GYN[ or other health care provider \nwith genetics expertise who is familiar with these new technologies and their limitations” (ACOG & SFM, \n2016) . This committee opinion was reaffirmed in 2023.  \nJoint Position Statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD), the Society for \nMaternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF)  \nPer the guideline, the word “sequencing” is used to refer to “whole exome sequencing, targeted analysis \nusing clinical panels, and whole genome sequencing.”  \n“The use of diagnostic sequencing is currently being introduced for evaluation of fetuses for whom \nstandard diagnostic genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), has already been \nperformed and is uninformative or is offered concurrentl y according to accepted practice guidelines, or \nfor whom expert genetic opinion determines that standard genetic testing is less optimal than \nsequencing for the presenting fetal phenotype” (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nRoutine use of prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot be supported due to “insufficient” \nvalidation and data about benefits and pitfalls (ISPD et al., 2018) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 16 of 25 \n \nWithin the section on recommendations for all diagnostic applications of genome -wide sequencing, \nconcerning trio analysis, they state, “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio \nanalysis, where fetal and both parental samples are s equenced and analyzed together. The trio approach \ncurrently benefits timeliness of result interpretation and aids assignment of pathogenicity for detected \nsequence variants. If proband‐only sequencing is performed, validation of diagnostic or potentially \ndiagnostic findings best includes a determination of inheritance through targeted testing of samples \nfrom biological parents” (ISPD et al., 2018) . However, the guideline could not recommend one \nsequencing method over another, nor was the guideline certain on the best way to interpret variants \nfound in genome -wide sequencing.  \nThe guideline provides three scenarios in which fetal sequencing may be “beneficial”:  \n“A current pregnancy with a fetus with a single major anomaly or with multiple organ system anomalies \nthat are suggestive of a possible genetic etiology, but no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA; or in \nselect situations with no CMA result, following a multidisciplinary review and consensus, in which there \nis a fetus with a multiple anomaly ‘pattern’ that strongly suggests a single gene disorder.”  \n“A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with a major \nsingle anomaly or multiple anomalies suggestive of a genetic etiology, and a recurrence of similar \nanomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic  diagnosis after karyotype or CMA. In addition, \nwhen such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected \nproband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it is considered appropriate \nto of fer sequencing for both biological parents to look for shared carrier status for autosomal recessive \nmutations that might explain the fetal phenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a \nprevious abnormal fetus or child for exome sequencing is  preferable.”  \n“In families with a history of recurrent stillbirths of unknown etiology after karyotype and/or CMA, \nwhere the fetus in the current pregnancy has a recurrent pattern of anomalies (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD released an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for \nprenatal diagnosis. Below are the pertinent recommendations:  \n• “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio analysis, where fetal and both \nparental samples are sequenced and analyzed together.”  \n• “Approaches to sequence analysis may vary from examination of genes known to be associated \nwith fetal or neonatal phenotypes to a broader genome -wide strategy. It is also uncertain whether \ninterpretation of variants found by genome -wide sequencing should f ollow the general guidelines \nfor interpretation and reporting of results for children and adults, or whether a more restrictive \napproach, limited to those variants that explain the phenotype is preferable in the prenatal \nsetting, or if a new approach restr icting reporting to severe childhood conditions should be \nconsidered.”  \n• “The current existing data support that prenatal sequencing is beneficial for the following \nindications:  \no A current pregnancy with a fetus having a major single anomaly or multiple organ anomalies:  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 17 of 25 \n \n▪ For which no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA and a clinical genetic expert review \nconsiders the phenotype suggestive of a possible genetic etiology.  \n▪ For which the multiple anomaly “pattern” strongly suggests a single gene disorder with \nno prior genetic testing. As pES is not currently validated to detect all CNVs, CMA should \nbe run before or in parallel with pES in this scenario.  \no A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with \na major single or multiple anomalies:  \n▪ With a recurrence of similar anomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic \ndiagnosis after karyotype or CMA for the current or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \n▪ When such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from \nthe affected proband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it \nis considered appropriate to offer sequencing for both biological parents to lo ok for \nshared carrier status for autosomal recessive mutations that might explain the fetal \nphenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a previous abnormal fetus or \nchild for pES is preferable.  \n• There is currently no evidence that supports routine testing (including upon parental request) on \nfetal tissue obtained from an invasive prenatal procedure (amniocentesis, CVS, cordocentesis, \nother) for indications other than fetal anomalies  \no There may be special settings when prenatal sequencing in the absence of a fetal phenotype \nvisible on prenatal imaging can be considered, such as with a strong family history of a \nrecurrent childhood‐onset severe genetic condition with no prenatal phenotyp e in previous \nchildren for whom no genetic evaluation was done and is not possible. Such scenarios should \nbe reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team preferentially in the context of a research \nprotocol. If sequencing is done for this indication, it mu st be done as trio sequencing, using \nan appropriate analytical approach” (Van den Veyver et al., 2022) . \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Kang et al., 2015)  on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management \nof congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) which state: “In individuals with CMD who either do not have \na mutation identified in one of the commonly associated genes or have a phenotype whose genetic \norigins have n ot been well characterized, physicians might order whole -exome or whole -genome \nsequencing when those technologies become more accessible and affordable for routine clinical use \n(Level C).”  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Narayanaswami et al., 2014)  on the diagnosis and treatment of \nlimb -girdle and distal dystrophies which state: “In patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom \ninitial clinically directed genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic \nconsultation o r perform parallel  sequencing  of targeted exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -\ngenome screening, or next -generation  sequencing  to identify the genetic abnormality (Level C).”  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology (AMP)  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 18 of 25 \n \nThe AMP published a report on the spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing \nprocedures for inherited conditions and cancer. The background of this report states, “Whole genome \nsequencing is currently more expensive than WES, requires gr eater analysis, and generates more \nvariants of uncertain significance. WES is a plausible approach when the clinical picture cannot be \naffirmed using a specific gene panel. As technologies and understanding of variants advance, whole \ngenome sequencing migh t become the test of choice” (Joseph et al., 2016) . \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  \nAAP published guidelines on the evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorder. According to the \nguidelines, CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. Since Fragile \nX Syndrome increases the risk for autism spectrum  disorder, DNA testing for Fragile X should be \nrecommended in all children with ASD, especially for boys and children with a family history of \nintellectual disability. “The cytosine -guanine -guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion that is responsible \nfor fra gile X syndrome is not detected on CMA and must be ordered as a separate test. When the history \nand physical examination, CMA, and fragile X analysis do not identify an etiology, the next step at this \ntime in the etiologic evaluation for [autism spectrum d isorder] is whole -exome sequencing (WES).” AAP \ndoes not recommend the use of commercially marketed tests as they do not provide a molecular \netiologic diagnosis (Hyman et al., 2020) .  \nCanadian College of Medical Geneticists  \nIn 2015, the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists published a position statement on genome -wide \nsequencing for monogenic diseases. Their relevant recommendations include the following:  \n• “Recommendations for diagnostic assessment:  \no Clinical exome sequencing, at this time, should only be used to interrogate the genome for \nnucleotide sequence variants in genes known to cause disease. Clinical WGS may be used to \ndetect CNV and structural variation in addition to sequence variants, thoug h it is not currently \na first -tier test for such analyses.  \no Clinical genome -wide sequencing should be considered in the investigation of an affected \nindividual when his/her phenotype or family history suggests a monogenic aetiology in whom \nthe causal mutation(s) are unknown, and one or more of the following additio nal conditions \napply:  \n▪ the phenotype is associated with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity;  \n▪ specific genetic tests have failed to arrive at a diagnosis and testing of other clinically \nrelevant genes is appropriate;  \n▪ genome -wide sequencing is a more cost -effective approach than available individual gene \nor gene panel testing.”  \n• “Until the benefits of reporting incidental findings are established, we do not endorse the \nintentional clinical analysis of disease -associated genes other than those linked to the primary \nindication.”  \nBelow is a figure of a “decision aid to facilitate the diagnostic evaluation of patients with rare disease of \nsuspected monogenic aetiology” (Boycott et al., 2015) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 19 of 25 \n \n \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians  \nIn 2021, the Royal Austalasian  College of Physicians provided guidelines on pediatric genetic testing in \nthe context of intellectual disability (ID) and global developmental delay (GDD). For childhood \nsyndromes or ID/GDD, the group recommends WES or WGS as tests of choice, since they o ffer “a broad, \nagnostic screen,” but acknowledge that WES is more widely available and cost -effective at the time of \npublication. In terms of ordering singleton or trio testing, the group states that “the latter (trio) approach \nis highly recommended given it simplifies analysis… it is also a more streamlined clinical test as trio \ntesting identifies fewer variants of uncertain significance than singleton testing” (Sachdev et al., 2021) . \nVI.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

As medical science evolves, AmeriHealth Caritas Pennsylvania will update its clinical \npolicies as necessary. AmeriHealth Caritas Pennsylvania clinical policies are not guarantees of payment . \nCoverage policy   \nAs the landscape of molecular testing is rapidly evolving, guideline -directed genetic testing for hereditary cancer \nsusceptibility is phenotype -directed (personal and family history ) and focuses on identifying gene mutations that \nare clinically actionable to avoid overtreatment or overscreening . A tiered approach starting with known familial \nmutations ( e.g., single -gene testing , syndrome -specific panels , cancer -specific panels ), with  reflex to more \ndetailed multigene testing  based on next -generation sequencing , may be medically necessary  (Bedrosian, 2024; \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network, 202 3, 202 4; Poylin, 2024 ). \nGenetic testing for hereditary cancer susceptibility  is clinicall y proven and, therefore, may be medically \nnecessary , when pre- and post -test genetic counseling is provided, and any of the following criteria are met \n(National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 20 23, 2024; Poylin, 2024 ): \n• Member has a  blood relative with a known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a cancer \nsusceptibility gene.  \n• Member meets any of the criteria below but tested negative or indeterminate with previous limited testing \n(e.g., single gene and/or absent deletion duplic ation analysis) and are interested in pursuing multi -gene \ntesting :  \no When a  pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant identified on tumor genomic testing or circulating \ntumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) assays has clinical implications if also identified in t he \ngermline.  \n\n\nCCP.1235   2 of 6 o To aid in systemic therapy and surgical decision -making.  \no When one or more genes may explain a member’s medical and family history.  \no When member’s medical or family history meets criteria for more than one syndrome.  \no When member’s medical and fa mily history is strongly suggestive of an inherited susceptibility , \nfor example, suspected Li -Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome/PTEN hamartoma tumor \nsyndrome, or Lynch syndrome; Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry without additional risk factors; serous \nendometrial  cancer; and history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, or colorectal cancers.  \nLimitations  \nAll other uses of genetic testing for hereditary cancer susceptibility , including determination of  clinical trial \neligib ility, are not medically necessary.  \nPolygenic risk scores are investigational/not clinically proven and, therefore, not medically necessary ( National \nComprehensive Cancer Network , 2024).  \nIn members younger than 18 years  of age , germline genetic testing for high -risk colorectal cancer syndrom es is \ngenerally not medically necessary  unless the results will impact medical management. Exception: w hen familial \nadenomatous polyposis is suspected, genetic testing in this age group may be medically necessary  to guide \nmedical management  (National Compr ehensive Cancer Network, 202 3).  \nGenetic testing  from ancestry services  is investigational/not clinically proven and, therefore, not medically \nnecessary , as these tests have not been validated for clinical use  (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, \n2023, 202 4).  \nCirculating tumor DNA  assays are not medically necessary for detecting germline variants, as these assays have \nnot been validated for reporting or interpret ing germline variants  (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, \n2023, 202 4).  \nGermline genetic testing is limited to once per lifetime per condition. Exception: repeat germline genetic testing \nmay be medically necessary if it is non-duplicative to identify different genetic content or information  using newer \nand more sensitive method ologies . \nAdditional  molecular testing may be reviewed on a case -by-case basis for medical necessity . \nAlternative covered services  \n• Guideline -directed medical management for each inherited cancer syndrome.  \n• Genetic counseling.  \nBackground  \nA hereditary cancer syndrome is a n inherit ed disorder in which a higher -than-normal risk of certain types of \ncancer  runs in the family. Inherited cancers account  for about 5% to 1 0% of all cancers  (American Cancer \nSociety , 2023). Often these cancers present at an early age and may be associated with several clinical \nmanifestations (American Society of Clinical Oncology,  2022).  \nHereditary cancer syndromes are  caused by germline mutations  that generally exhibit an autosomal dominant \ninheritance  pattern  (American Society of Clinical Oncology, 20 22). This pattern  requires only one mutated gene, \nlocated on a nonsex chromosome (autosome), to cause disease in offspring. These germline mutations generally \nemanate  from mistakes in DNA  replication . Left uncorrected, the mutations may lead to deleterious mutations in \ntumor suppressor genes or oncogenes that affect cell growth and death. Examples of such mutations are in the \nBRCA1 , BRCA2 , and p53 or TP53  genes .  \n\nCCP.1235   3 of 6 The most common hereditary cancer syn dromes  include hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch \nsyndrome, Li –Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Peutz –Jeghers syndrome, and hereditary diffuse gastric \ncancer. Familial cancer syndromes , for which heritable risk has been identified and which are particularly notable \nin the population , occur among those patients suffering from colorectal cancer. Among the diagnoses familiar for \nwell-defined risk of heritable disease in this group are  (American Society of Clinical Oncology, 20 22): \n• Lynch syndrome  (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer).  \n• Familial adenomatous polyposis.  \n• MutY human homolog -associated polyposis.  \n• Peutz –Jeghers syndrome . \n• Juvenile polyposis.  \n• Serrated polyposis syndrome.  \nComprehensive  hereditary  cancer risk assessment a nd counseling include clinical assessment, predictive \ngermline genetic testing when appropriate, and risk management recommendations as part of  one or more \ngenetic counseling sessions  (National Cancer Institute, 202 2). Germline genetic testing strategies encompass \nsingle gene o r multigene  testing, which can simultaneously test for multiple pathogenic genetic variants.  \nMultigene testing includes syndrome -specific tests, cancer -specific tests, and comprehensive cancer panels that \ntest for multipl e genes associated with a variety of  cancers or cancer types using blood or saliva  samples.  As \nwith single gene testing, the rati onale for multigene testing  focuses on identifying mutations known to be clinically \nactionable. When one or more genes  may infl uence clinical management, multigene testing may be more \nefficient or cost  effective.  \nDirect-to-consumer  tests are now available but typically do not include professional genetic counseling or \ninterpretation and may be incomplete or require confirmation w ith another sample (National Cancer Institute, \n2022).  \nFindings  \nThere is a growing body of evidence regarding genetic testing for hereditary cancer susceptibility. Much of the \navailable medical evidence to date has focused on the study of individuals and  families at high risk of cancer, \nand of selected tumors, to investigate the genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures that may alter \ncancer risk. As a rule, both genetic and environmental risk factor information specific for the tumor type is \nobtained to establish a risk score and prediction for heritable susceptibility.  \nRegarding multigene testing , there are limited data and a lack of clear guidance with respect to the degree of \nrisk associated with some genes in these panels, particularly gen es of low or moderate penetrance. There may \nalso be some doubt as to how to best manage and communicate the risk for gene carriers. Choice of testing \npanel is multifactorial. Considerations include phenotype, the number of genes analyzed, turnaround time, the \nlikelihood of detecting variants of unknown significance, and the potential of next -generation sequencing \nmethods to miss important variants that would be detected with single  gene methods. Therefore, multigene \ntesting should be offered in the context of professional genetics expertise  (National Comprehensive Cancer \nNetwork, 202 3, 202 4).  \nPhenotype should direct the testing plan with a focus on identifying gene mutations that are clinically actionable \nto avoid overtreatment or overscreening. Multigene t esting is most useful when: one or more genes can explain \na patient’s medical and family history; a patient’s personal or family history meets criteria for more than one \nsyndrome; or the patient’s medical and family history is strongly suggestive of an inh erited susceptibility and \nprior single gene testing is negative or indeterminate  (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 202 3, 202 4).  \n\nCCP.1235   4 of 6 National Comprehensive Cancer Network  provides general and specific genetic testing criteria for hereditary \ncancer syndro mes in several guidelines. General i ndications for genetic testing  are as follows  (National \nComprehensive Cancer Network, 2024 ): \n• Individuals with any blood relative with a known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a cancer \nsusceptibility gene.  \n• Individuals meeting the criteria below but who tested negative with previous limited testing (e .g., single \ngene and/or absent deletion duplication analysis) and are interested in pursuing multi -gene testing .  \no A pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant ident ified on tumor genomic testing that has clinical \nimplications if also identified in the germline . \no To aid in systemic therapy and surgical decision -making .  \no Individual who meets testing criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome , Cowden syndrome/PTEN \nhamartoma tumor  syndrome , or Lynch syndrome . \no Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry without additional risk factors . \no A personal history of serous endometrial cancer . \no A personal or family history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, or colorectal cancers.  \nPolygenic risk scores , which are groups of single nucleotide polymorphism associated with a specific disorder \nor disease used to refine risks in those with hereditary cancer,  should not be used to inform clinical management \nas their clinical value has not been established  (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2024) .  \nThe American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons states a family history of polyposis is not required to pursue \ngenetic testing , because the absence of a family history of polyposis or colorectal cancer does not exclude the \ndiagnosis of a polyposis syndrome. The Society recommends  testing for the known familial pathologic variant  in \nat-risk family members of a polyposis patient with an identified pathogenic variant . Management of patients with \na suspected aden omatous polyposis syndrome should include a thorough family history, referral to genetic \ncounseling, and testing with a multigene panel (Poylin, 2024).   \nA joint guideline by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the National Society of Genetic \nCounselors presents a comprehensive list of referral indications for cancer predisposition assessment based on \npersonal and family history criteria (Hampel, 2015). The purpose of the guideline is to facilitate identification and \nappropriate referra l of at -risk individuals for cancer genetic consultation for a wide range of inherited cancers.  \nAn American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics technical standard  provides guidance on a multigene \npanel testing approach for hereditary colorectal cance r and polyposis. It identified 23 genes associated with \nhereditary colorectal cancer or polyposis recommended as the minimum list of genes for multigene panel testing \n(Mao, 2021).  \nFor p atients with breast cancer undergoing BRCA1/2 testing , the American So ciety of Clinical Oncology  \nrecommends testing for other cancer predisposition genes as suggested by personal or family history \n(Bedrosian, 2024) . According to the Society, next-generation sequencing can facilitate identification of inherited \ncancer suscept ibility in the course of somatic mutation profiling or through direct germline multigene panel \ntesting.  Concurrent multigene panel testing may be efficient for (Robson, 2015):  \n• Examining multiple high -penetrance genes of established clinical utility to disc ern possible explanations \nfor a patient's personal or family history of cancer.  \n• Identifying gene variants associated with moderate or low cancer risks.  \n• Identifying variants in high -penetrance genes that would not have been evaluated on the basis of the \npresenting personal or family history need.  \nIn 2021, we deleted several references . We modified the coverage based on information from updated  National \nComprehensive Cancer Network  guidelines , as follows . We included  statement s that c omprehensive genetic \n\nCCP.1235   5 of 6 testing should include full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements , and should be performed \nin certified  laboratories. Germline testing may also be indicated to confirm a pathogenic variant found on tumor \n(somatic) testing that has clinical  implications if also identified in the germline.  We added limitation statements \nfor germline testing in minors, commercial entities that offer ancestry information, and circulating tumor DNA  \nassays.  \nIn 2022 , current research investigated validates the pr esent policy content.  \nIn 2023, we deleted references to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  and updated the reference  list. We \nadded two guideline s to the policy (Mao, 2021 ; Robson, 2015 ). No policy changes are warranted.  \nIn 2024, we deleted retired  references, updated existing references, and added two guidelines to the policy. \nCoverage was modified to align with recent guideline changes from the National Comprehensive Cancer \nNetwork, the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons , and the American Society of Clinical Oncology .  \nReferences  \nOn May 1, 2024 , we searched PubMed and the databases of the Cochrane Library, the U.K. National Health \nServices Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Search terms were  “Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary ” [MAJR] , \n“Genetic Predisposition to disease” (MeSH), “Genetic Testing” (MeSH), and “Neoplasms” (MeSH).”  We included \nthe best available evidence according to established evidence hierarchies (typically systematic reviews, me ta-\nanalyses, and full economic analyses, where available) and professional guidelines based on such evidence and \nclinical expertise.  \n \nAmerican Cancer Society.

The WGS was performed in ‘rapid run’ mode with minimum depth of 90 Gb per \ngenome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold. \nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and, in the NICU or PICU, when the \ntest is ordered but may be discharged before results are delivered. \nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using \nchromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within rWGS if the test is validated for CNV \nanalysis. \nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, include but are not \nlimited to any of the following: \n Choanal atresia \n Coloboma \n Hirschsprung disease \n Meconium ileus \n \nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic \nphenotype include, but are not limited to, any of the following: \n Abnormal newborn screen \n Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis \n Hyperammonemia \n Lactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion \n Refractory or severe hypoglycemia \n \nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include, but not limited to, any of the \nfollowing: \n Significant hypotonia \n Persistent seizures \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 4  \n Infant with high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief resolved unexplained event \n(BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features: \no Recurrent events without respiratory infection \no Recurrent witnessed seizure like events \no Required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \no Significantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate \nor lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other tests that suggest an inborn error \nof metabolism \n Significantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible \nchannelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or structural heart disease \n Family history of: \no Arrhythmia \no BRUE in sibling \no Developmental delay \no Inborn error of metabolism or genetic disease \no Long QT syndrome (LQTS) \no Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- \nor second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant \n \nBRUE \nBrief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) was previously known as apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE).

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Whole exome sequencing and WGS have been proposed  for use in patients presenting\nwith disorders and anomalies not explained by a standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a\nbroad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether whole exome or whole genome sequencing improves the net health outcome in\nindividuals with suspected genetic disorders.\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Seizure \ntypes include generalized seizures (absence seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic \nseizures), focal seizures (simple focal seizures, complex focal seizures, secondary \ngeneralized seizures, among others), and seizures for which the type is unknown. \nEpilepsy syndromes can be associated with generalized, focal, or combined \ngeneralized and focal seizures, and can have onset in childhood or adulthood.2 \nEpilepsy syndromes may be associated with developmental and/or epileptic \nencephalopathy (childhood onset) or progressive neurological deterioration (later \nonset).2 \nCause \nEpilepsy has multiple causes, including central nervous system infection, autoimmune \ndisease, structural brain abnormalities, brain tumors, and head trauma.3 There are also\nnumerous genetic conditions associated with epilepsy. It is estimated that \napproximately 40% of individuals with seizures have an underlying genetic basis for \ntheir condition (see Table 1 for a list of common genetic causes).4 Factors that \ncontribute to the likelihood of a genetic basis includes type of seizures (focal or \ngeneralized) or epilepsy syndromes (such as epileptic encephalopathy), age of onset, \nfamily history, and presence of other clinical features.\nThrough Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based testing, including multi-gene \npanels, whole exome and genome sequencing as well as whole-genome screening for \nCNVs, pathogenic sequence variants have been identified in about 30-40% and \ndeletions or duplications in ~5-10% of patients with a range of epilepsy phenotypes, \nincluding focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsies, epileptic encephalopathies, fever-\nassociated epilepsy syndromes, other epilepsy syndromes, and patients with \nneurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.5,6 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 11 of 20\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Epilepsy                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nThere are many different epilepsy syndromes, including generalized epilepsy \nsyndromes, focal epilepsy syndromes, combined generalized and focal epilepsy \nsyndromes, epilepsy syndromes with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy \n(DEE). These syndromes can present at variable ages ranging from neonatal to \nadulthood.2,7 \nDEE is a group of disorders in which seizures are accompanied by developmental \ndelays, cognitive impairment, or a host of other neurological issues such as feeding \ndifficulties, sleep dysregulation, and behavioral problems.8 Knowledge regarding the \ngenetic basis of these disorders has increased significantly in the last decade due to \nthe advent of high throughput NGS methods, resulting in wider availability of multi-gene\npanel testing. The following are examples of epileptic encephalopathies:\nOhtahara Syndrome (Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy)\no“Characterized by early onset intractable tonic spasms, suppression-burst \npattern on interictal EEG, and poor prognosis.”  9 \no“To date various genes, which have essential roles in the brain’s neuronal and \ninterneuronal functions, have been reported to be associated with Ohtahara \nsyndrome. For instance, syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) regulates synaptic\nvesicle release; aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) acts as a regulator of \nproliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors; solute carrier family 25 \nmember 22 (SLC25A22) encodes a mitochondrial glutamate transporter13; and \npotassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 2 (KCNQ2) plays\na key role in a cell’s ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.”  10 \nDravet Syndrome (Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy)\no“Clinical cardinal features include febrile or afebrile generalized or \nhemiconvulsions starting in the first year of life, seizure evolution to a mixture of \nintractable generalized (myoclonic or atonic seizures, atypical absences) and \nfocal seizures, normal early development, subsequent psychomotor retardation, \nand normal brain imaging at onset.”  9 \no“In most of the cases with Dravet syndrome, one single gene has been involved,\nin contrast to other epileptic encephalopathy syndromes. SCN1A mutations \nhave been shown in at least 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome.”  10 \nInfantile Spasms (West Syndrome and X-linked Infantile Spasms)\no“West syndrome is characterized by a specific seizure type, i.e., epileptic \nspasms, a unique interictal EEG pattern termed hypsarrhythmia, and \npsychomotor retardation. Spasms start within the first year of life, mainly \nbetween 4 and 6 months of age.”  9 \no“There are multiple genetic determinants of infantile spasms, which are usually \nexplained by mutations in distinct genes. Genetic analysis of children with \nunexplained infantile spasms have demonstrated mutations on the X \nchromosome in genes such as ARX, cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), \nand UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit (ALG13) as well as de novo \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Seizure, cognitive, and \npsychiatric phenotypes show heterogeneity. Seizures start from the age of 6 to \n36 months and may be precipitated by fever. Seizure types include GTCS, \nmyoclonic and tonic seizures, absences, and focal.”  9 \no“Different mutations of PCDH19 (protocadherin 19), including missense, \nnonsense, and frameshift mutations, have been reported as the cause of \nEFMR.” 9 \nInheritance \nInheritance patterns differ between various epilepsy syndromes, and include \nmonogenic inheritance patterns such as dominant, X-linked, recessive, and \nmitochondrial, in addition to epilepsy caused by de novo (i.e. new) genetic mutations. \nClinical heterogeneity is also seen in these conditions.\nDiagnosis \nAn electroencephalograph (EEG) can be used to help diagnose epilepsy and possibly \ngive information as to the seizure type. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \nscan can further help define whether epilepsy is caused by a structural brain \nabnormality or help determine the origin of epilepsy. \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is complicated by many factors. Epilepsy syndromes \nfrequently have overlapping features, such as the types of seizures involved and/or \nadditional clinical findings. Many (if not most) epilepsy syndromes, including epileptic \nencephalopathy, are genetically heterogeneous, and can be caused by mutations in a \nnumber of different genes. Sometimes, the inheritance pattern or the presence of \npathognomonic features makes the underlying syndrome clear. However, in many \ncases, it can be difficult to reliably diagnose a genetic epilepsy syndrome based on \nclinical and family history alone.\nNGS-based testing has been shown to dramatically improve the diagnostic rate for \nchildren and adults with epilepsy, as well as significantly shorten the time from \nassessment to diagnosis.11-13 The diagnostic yield of NGS in patients with epilepsy is \nestimated to be 20-40%.6,14,15 \nClinical information (e.g. age of onset, seizure type, EEG results, etc.) or family history \nmay be used in some cases to help narrow down the suspected cause. In these cases,\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Not all \ntreatments will work for everyone and often, it takes multiple treatment trials to find a \nregimen that is successful. Refractory epilepsy is diagnosed after two or more AEDs \nhave failed to control seizures. Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined as \"failure of \nadequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules \n(whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom\".16\nIn a rapidly growing number of epilepsy disorders, knowing the genetic mutation that is \nresponsible for the epilepsy has been shown to help guide management and provide \nmore disease-specific treatment.17,18 \nSurvival \nLifespan is dependent upon seizure control and the underlying cause of the individual's\nepilepsy.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nGenetic testing for epilepsy may consist of next-generation sequencing or multigene \npanels.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries.

In this age period, the diagnostic yield of \ngenetic testing may reach up to 60%. However, age at testing (as opposed to the \nage at onset of epilepsy) should not influence the decision to test or the type of test \nchosen. Individuals who are now adults who had early-onset epilepsy likely \npresented in the era before genetic testing was widely available, and should be \nconsidered candidates for testing.\" \n\"Clinical utility of genetic testing is highest in the more severe, drug-resistant \nepilepsies . Overall, the most obvious indication, in terms of clinical utility and \ndiagnostic yield, is for people with early-onset DEE or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders with epilepsy.

We conditionally recommend ES/GS over MGP as the first-tier test.\"\n\"The MGP panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and include copy number \nanalysis.\"\n\"MGPs are valuable clinical tools that can be employed in a number of clinical \nscenarios, for example, when an individual presents with a defined epilepsy \nsyndrome for which a subset of genes should be interrogated more robustly than \nthrough ES when GS is unavailable. Additionally, if urgent results are required and \nrapid ES/GS is unavailable, a targeted MGP may be considered. MGPs may also \nbe utilized as a first-tier test when access to ES/GS, or the additional genetic \ncounseling required to implement such testing, may be limited.\"\nSelected Relevant Publications \nPeer reviewed and expert authored articles are presented below. \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic testing for epileptic encephalopathy \nstated the following: \no“Second line investigations: Targeted next generation sequencing panels of \nepileptic encephalopathy genes for individuals with epileptic encephalopathy.”  8 \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic causes of early-onset epileptic \nencephalopathy stated the following:10 \no“Molecular-based studies on early-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be \nperformed, necessitating programmed genetical algorithms. If the phenotype \ncould be determined with clinical findings, specific gene testing would be helpful \nin diagnosis. However, if the phenotype could not be determined because of \noverlapping phenotypes of different syndromes and the spectrum of phenotypes\nseen in different mutations, the use of gene panels for epilepsy would increase \nthe probability of correct diagnosis.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Alternatively, sequencing may be performed outside a research setting on \na case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected for which a confirmatory\ngenetic diagnosis can be obtained more quickly and accurately by sequencing. \nSuch cases should be managed after consultation with and under the expert \nguidance of genetic professionals working in multidisciplinary teams with expertise \nin the clinical diagnostic application of sequencing, including interpretation of \ngenomic sequencing results and how they translate to the prenatal setting, as well \nas expertise in prenatal imaging and counseling.”  \n“There is currently limited genotype-phenotype correlation for the genetic disorders \nidentified in the fetal period because ultrasound imaging is frequently limited, and \nthe fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described.”  \nSelected Relevant Publications \nThe clinical utility of prenatal genomic sequencing is currently lacking. Multiple recent \nreviews cite a need for further research to better understand the impact of testing in the\nclinical setting.22-25 Future studies are needed to \"better understand which pregnancies \nbenefit most and how to prioritise cases in a way that maximizes benefit\" and to \n\"determine the extent to which prenatal genomic sequencing results actually alter \nperinatal care.\"25,26 \nPrenatal genomic sequencing aims to improve reproductive decision-making, allow for \nmore informed pregnancy and perinatal management options, and reduce morbidity \nand mortality.24,25 However, there is a paucity of well-designed studies examining the \nuse of prenatal WGS, and routine usage cannot be recommended due to insufficient \ndata and a need to address several complex clinical scenarios that may arise during \nclinical use.23,25,26 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Scientific Background  \nGene  mutations  are referred  to as “germline”  if they  are within gametes  (ova  and sperm) . Therefore,  \nthese  mutations  may  be passed  on from  parent  to offspring.  There  are many  different  types  of germline  \nmutations,  such as single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs),  structural  variations  such  as deletions,  \ninversions,  or translocations,  as well as smaller  chromosomal  abnormalities  such as short  tandem  repeats,  \nor gene  fusions. M utations  may  not necessarily  result  in disease.  \nSNPs  are the most  common  type  of genetic  mutation,  such  as missense  mutations.  These mutations  are \nsingle  base -pair changes  where  one nucleotide  is replaced  with  a different  nucleotide . Millions  of \nindividual  SNPs  have  been  identified  through  genome -wide  association  studies,  with  approximately  4000  \nSNPs  with  potential  association  with  disease . Insertion/deletion  (indel)  polymorphisms  are often  a single  \nnucleotide  but may  be up to four nucleotides.  SNPs  often  lead  to frameshift  mutations,  which  can cause  \npremature  stop  codons  and the failure  of the allele . \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 4 of 10 \nStructural variations  are usually  classified  as larger than  1000 base  pairs. These  include  deletions,  \nduplications,  inversions,  translocations,  or ring chromosome  formation.  Due to the large  number  of bases  \naffected,  these  variations  may  lead  to severe  genetic  abnormalities.  For example,  a major cause  of \nDuchenne  muscular  dystrophy  is the deletion  of large  portions  of exons  (coding  portions  of genes) . The \nmost  common  structural  variation  is the copy  number  variant  (CNV),  which  refers  to differing  amounts  of \nDNA  segments  in different  individuals.  For example,  one person  may  have  three  copies  of a specific  \nsegment  whereas  another  may  only  have  two.  These variations  may  lead  to dysregulation,  gain-of-\nfunction,  or loss-of-function  of the affected  genes.  The sensitive  genes  that require  or produce  precise  \namounts  of a protein  product  tend  to suffer more  from  these  variations. \nGermline  mutations  are unique  in that the risk for certain  conditions , including  many  forms  of cancer , \nmay  be passed  from  parent  to offspring. Testing  for these conditions  will often  involve  testing  entire  \nfamilies  if one member  is found to have  a germline  mutation ; for example,  the National Comprehensive  \nCancer  Network  (NCCN ) guidelines  for hereditary  cancer  recommend  testing  for BRCA 1/2, CDH1,  PALB2,  \nPTEN  and TP53  mutations  if any blood  relative  has a known or likely  pathogenic  variant  in a cancer  \nsusceptibility  gene . Wilson  e t  al. (2020)  estimate  that 21,800 adult  survivors  of childhood  cancer in the \nUnited  States  carry  a pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variant  in one of 156 cancer  predisposition  genes.  \n \nOther  types  of mutations  are unique  to germline  mutations.  Errors  in chromosome  number  (aneuploidy)  \nare typically  caused  by non- disjunctions  in meiosis, causing  either  a monosomic  (one  chromosome)  or a \ntrisomic  (three  chromosomes)  set of chromosomes.  Some  aneuploidies , trisomy  21, or Down  Syndrome , \nbeing  most  notable , are compatible  with  life. Aneuploidies  may  also result  with  sex chromosomes,  \nresulting  in conditions  such as Turner’s  Syndrome  (one  X chromosome)  or Klinefelter’s  Syndrome  (XXY).  \nAny size mutation  may  be pathogenic  and must  be classified  as to how  likely  they  are to cause  disease. \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  (ACMG ) has classified  mutations  in five \ncategories,  which  are as follows:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  uncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and \nbenign.  The “likely  pathogenic”  and “likely  benign”  refer to weaker  evidence  than  their  respective  \npathogenic  and benign categories,  and “uncertain  significance”  refers  to evidence  that does  not meet  \ncriteri a for benignity  or pathogenicity  or has conflicting  evidence  from  both  sides.  Prediction  algorithms  \nhave  been used to interpret  variants  and to predict  whether  a variant  will affect  the gene  function or \nsplicing  of the gene.  These  algorithms  are publicly  available  but have  a tendency  of predicting  harmful \nimpact  of a variant.  The specificity  of these  databases  has been estimated  at 60-80%.  \nDue to t he  enormous  number  of variants,  as well as the rate that variants  are discovered,  comprehensive  \ndatabases  of genetic  variants  have  been published and are easily  available. For example,  the Haplotype  \nReference  Consortium  contains  over  40 million  identified  SNPs . Databases  focusing on cancer -specific  \nvariants,  reference  sequences , and the general  population  are all available  publicly.   \nFor many  years,  single -gene  testing  was the standard  approach  for germline  mutation  testing.  In recent  \nyears,  multigene  panel  testing  (MGPT)  has been introduced and widely  accepted  as the first-tier test.  \nMGPT  increases  the probability  of identifying  pathogenic  mutations  and represents  an affordable  \napplication  of next -generation sequencing  (NGS)  into clinical practice.  However,  the clinical utility  of \nMGPT  is not well established,  especially  in cases  where  more  than  one pathogenic  variant  is identified.  \nThe risk for a specific  malignancy  is complex  and if a gene  panel  discovers  a mutation  incidentally,  \nmanagement  can be difficult.  Many  guidelines  call for radical  procedures  for these  disease  states  and it \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 5 of 10 \nmay  cause  unnecessary  harm  for the patient  concerned  about  predisposition  to the disease.  Additionally,  \na combination  of mutations  may  interact  to alter the profile  of the disease. For instance,  certain  \ncombinations  of mutations  may  be detrimental and increase  the overall  risk of cancer  malignancy,  while  \nother  combinations  may  reduce  overall  risk of malignancy.  In this regard,  identifying  clinically  actionable  \nmutations  may  be unclear  with  MGPT.   \nClinical  Utility  and Validity  \nGenetic  testing  for germline  mutations  “can be conducted  on virtually  any tissue  type, ” although  many  \nlaboratories  prefer blood  samples,  check  swabs  or saliva  samples.  Advancements  in technology  and \navailability  of sequencing,  previously  constrained by limitations  of sequential  single -gene  testing  on \nlimited  patient  samples,  have  led to significant  strides  in the understanding  of the genetic  basis  of \ninherited  and somatic  conditions.   \nVariants  detected  by genetic  testing  include  inherited  germline  variants  and somatic  mutations ; next  \ngeneration  sequencing (NGS)  has allowed  for superior  detection  for these  mutations.  The accuracy  of \nNGS  varies  depending on how  many  genes  are sequenced;  fewer  genes  tend  to result  in higher  accuracy  \nsince  there  will be more  “probe -template  overlap .” Although Sanger  sequencing  remains  the most  \naccurate  at >99.99%  accuracy,  it cannot  sequence  a large  quantity  of genes  in a timely  fashion  and is best  \nused  for sequencing  of a specific  gene.  Pogoda  et al. (2019)  identified  rare variants  in the ATM  gene by \nusing single molecule Molecular Inversion Probes (smMIPSs) , an NGS -based screening method . A total \nof 373 patients with dystonia and six positive controls with previously identified ATM  variants \nparticipated in this study. Results generated by the smMIPs  “produced similar results as routinely used \nNGS -based approaches ” (Pogoda et al., 2019) . This suggests that ATM  screening should be routinely \nused when genetic testing dystonia patients.  Further, smMIPs may be an important technique for the \ngermline screening for all rare neurodegenerative disorders.  \nThe c linical  validity  of a genetic  test depends  primarily  on the expressivity  and penetrance  of a given  \nphenotype.  Penetrance  refers  to the likelihood  of developing  a disease  when the pathogenic  mutation  is \npresent,  and expressivity  refers  to the variations  in the way the disease  is expressed.  For example,  \nvirtually  any mutation  in the APC gene  will cause  symptoms  of familial  adenomatous  polyposis,  thereby  \nincreasing  the clinical  validity  of an APC assessment  while  other  conditions  may  not clinically  manifest  at \nall despite  a mutated  genotype.   \nThe clinical  utility  of a genetic  test generally  relies  on available  treatments  for a condition.  Conditions  \nsuch  as Huntington Disease  that do not have  many  options  for treatment  will have  limited  clinical utility  \ncompared to another  condition  even  though the actual test is highly  valid.  Factors , such  as severity of the \ndisease  and management  options , affect  the clinical  utility  of a genetic  test.   \nLincoln  et al. (2020)  performed  a retrospective study  to investigate the yield  and utility  of germline  \ntesting  on cancer  patients  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing.  The authors  calculated  the prevalence  of \npathogenic  germline  variants  (PVG)  and the potential  actionability  of the PVGs  in 2023  cancer  patients . \n30.5%  (n=617)  of participants  had PVGs . Participants  with  PVGs  spanned  all ages  and cancer  types.  \nTumor  DNA  sequencing missed 8.1%  of PGVs . 11.2%  of missed  PVGs  were  only  detected  after \ndeveloping a second  primary  cancer.  The results  suggest  that missed PVGs  could  have  been  detected  \nearlier and the second  cancer  could  have  been  treated  earlier or prevented.  The authors  concluded  \nthat germline  testing  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing can result  in important  findings  that can impact  \npatient  care.  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 6 of 10 \nVI. Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular \nPathology  (AMP)   \nThe ACMG and AMP released criteria on the types and severity of mutations, which are as follows:  \n• Very strong evidence of pathogenicity : Null variants (nonsense, frameshifts, canonical +/ - 1-2 splice \nsites, initiation codon, exon deletions) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease. The guidelines note to use caution in genes where LOF is not a mechanism, if L OF variants \nare at the 3’ end, if exon skipping occurs, and if multiple transcripts are present.  \n• Strong: Amino acid change to a pathogenic version, de novo mutations, established studies \nsupporting a damaging gene or gene product, or if the prevalence of the variant is increased in affected individuals compared to healthy controls. The guidelines note to be careful of changes \nimpacting splicing and if only the paternity has been confirmed.  \n• Moderate: Located in a mutational hot spot or well- established functional domain (e.g., active site \nof an enzyme) without a benign variation, absent from controls in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium, detected in trans  with pathogenic variants for \na recessive disorder, protein length changes, novel missense changes where a different missense \nchange has been pathogenic before, and a possible de novo mutation.  \n• Supporting: Co -segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively \nknown to cause the disease, missense variant in a gene with low rate of benign missense variation, \nif the mutation has evidence that it is deleterious, or if the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for \ndisease with a single genetic cause.  \nThe guidelines also list criteria for benign gene variants.  \n• Stand- alone evidence of benignity: Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 \nGenomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium  \n• Strong: Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder, observed in healthy adult with full \npenetrance at early age, lack of segregation in affected family members (although pathogenic variants may masquerade as nonsegregated), or well -established studies that show no damaging \neffect on protein production.  \n• Supporting: Missense variant of a gene for which truncating mutations are pathogenic, indels in \nrepetitive region of unknown function, silent variants, variants of unknown significance, or a trans  \nversion of a cis mutation.  \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN)   \nMultiple germline  mutations have been incorporated into the diagnostic workups recommended by the \nNCCN. Furthermore, the NCCN has several guidelines which recommend that gene expression profiling, or multiple gene testing, may be helpful, more efficient and/or cost -effecti ve for selected patients. \nPlease see the individual policies.  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology  (AMP) , American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) , and College \nof American Pathologists ( CAP)  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 7 of 10 \nThe Joint Commission noted that germline variants should focus on the pathogenicity of a given variant \nrather than their impact on clinical care. The guidelines recommend reporting germline variants with known clinical impact , such as BRCA1  or 2. A genetic counseling recommendation should also be \nprovided if a pathogenic germline mutation is found.  \nThe guidelines note that it is critical to identify a somatic vs a germline mutation as the type of mutation \nmay have significant clinical consequences . \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology  (ASCO)   \nThe ASCO published guidelines regarding genetic and genomic testing for cancer susceptibility. These guidelines state that  the “ASCO recognizes that concurrent multigene testing (ie, panel testing) may be \nefficient in circumstances that require evaluation of multiple high -penetrance genes of established \nclinical utility as possible explanations for a patient’s personal or family history of cancer. Depending on the specific genes included on the panel employed, panel testing may also identify mutations in genes associat ed with moderate or low cancer risks and mutations in high -penetrance genes that would not \nhave been evaluated on  the basis of the presenting personal or family history… ASCO affirms that it is \nsufficient for cancer risk assessment to evaluate genes of established clinical utility that are suggested by the patient’s personal and/or family history .” \nASCO released guidelines regarding germline testing for ovarian  cancer. ASCO recommends that “ all \nwomen diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer should be offered germline genetic testing for BRCA1, \nBRCA2 , and other ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, irrespective of their clinical features or family \ncancer history. In addition, “first - or second -degree blood relatives of a patient with ovarian cancer with \na known germline pathogenic cancer susceptibility  gene mutation or variant should be offered \nindividualized genetic risk evaluation, counseling, and genetic testing.” Lastly, “ clinical decisions should \nnot be based on a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).” In this case, the patient’s clinical features and family history should be taken into consideration and should inform clinical decision making.  \nVII.

The WGS was performed in ‘rapid run’ mode with minimum depth of 90 Gb per \ngenome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold. \nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and, in the NICU or PICU, when the \ntest is ordered but may be discharged before results are delivered. \nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using \nchromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within rWGS if the test is validated for CNV \nanalysis. \nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, include but are not \nlimited to any of the following: \n Choanal atresia \n Coloboma \n Hirschsprung disease \n Meconium ileus \n \nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic \nphenotype include, but are not limited to, any of the following: \n Abnormal newborn screen \n Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis \n Hyperammonemia \n Lactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion \n Refractory or severe hypoglycemia \n \nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include, but not limited to, any of the \nfollowing: \n Significant hypotonia \n Persistent seizures \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 4  \n Infant with high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief resolved unexplained event \n(BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features: \no Recurrent events without respiratory infection \no Recurrent witnessed seizure like events \no Required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \no Significantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate \nor lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other tests that suggest an inborn error \nof metabolism \n Significantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible \nchannelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or structural heart disease \n Family history of: \no Arrhythmia \no BRUE in sibling \no Developmental delay \no Inborn error of metabolism or genetic disease \no Long QT syndrome (LQTS) \no Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- \nor second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant \n \nBRUE \nBrief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) was previously known as apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE).

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Whole exome sequencing and WGS have been proposed  for use in patients presenting\nwith disorders and anomalies not explained by a standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a\nbroad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether whole exome or whole genome sequencing improves the net health outcome in\nindividuals with suspected genetic disorders.\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for determining hereditary breast and\novarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy . Testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all\nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years, may be indicated for\nguiding cancer therapies. Genetic testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in breast cancer-, pancreatic cancer-, prostate cancer-, or ovarian cancer-\naffected individuals who are considering systemic therapy is addressed separately in evidence reviews 2.04.151, 2.04.148, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156,\nrespectively . Genetic testing for PALB2  variants in pancreatic cancer-af fected individuals is also addressed in 2.04.148. Additionally , conflicting criteria\nreflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited or no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of\ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.\nCurrent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation. W omen with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should\nreceive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant. In addition, there are potential harms related to stigmatization and discrimination. See policy 2.04.128 regarding testing of BRCA1 , BRCA2,\nand PALB2  for Fanconi anemia.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result\non the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation). The USPSTFFEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

(D recommendation)\"\nRecommended screening tools included the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool, Manchester Scoring System, Referral Screening Tool, Pedigree\nAssessment Tool, 7-Question Family History Screening Tool, International Breast Cancer Intervention Study instrument (T yrer-Cuziak), and brief\nversions of the BRCAPRO.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere are no national coverage determinations. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of\nlocal Medicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Chapman-Davis E, Zhou ZN, Fields JC, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

Rapid genome sequencing (81425, 81426, 0094U) is considered investigational  for all \nother indications. \nback to top  \n \nNOTES AND DEFINITIONS  \nExome Sequencing (ES)  is a genomic technique for sequencing all of the protein-coding regions \nof genes in the genome (also known as the exome). \nGenom\ne Sequencing (GS)  is a genomic technique for sequencing the complete DNA sequence, \nwhich includes protein coding as well as non- codin g DNA elements.  \nTrio \nTesting  includes testing of the child and both biological/genetic parents and increases the \nchances of finding a definitive diagnosis, while reducing false- positi ve findings.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  10 \n \nComparator Exome Sequencing is used only for comparison with the proband (individual \nundergoing exome sequencing) and is used to inform the pathogenicity of variants. A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022). The NSGC \nrecommendations are as follows (p. 4):  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  14 \n \n- Individuals with unexplained epilepsy should be offered genetic testing, without \nlimitatio\nn of age.  \n- Multi -gene, comprehensive testing, such as exome sequencing, genome sequencing or a \nmultigene panel as a first -tier test is strongly recommended  \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS)  \nPLUGS developed an expert- written exome sequencing coverage policy as part of their insurance \nalignment focus. Their policy includes the following criteria for exome sequencing:  \n● The patient and family history have been evaluated by a Board - Certifi ed or Board -\nEligible Medical Geneticist, or an Advanced Practice Nurse in Genetics (APGN) credentialed by either the Genetic Nursing Credentialing Commission (GNCC) or the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC ) AND  \n● A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype, \nbased on EITHER of the following AND  \n○ Multiple congenital abnormalities affecting unrelated organ systems  \n○ TWO  of the following criteria are met:  \n■ abnormality affecting at minimum a single organ system  signifi cant \nneurodevelopmental disorder (e.g., global developmental delay, intellectual disability , and/or period of unexplained developmental regression )  \n■ symptoms of a complex neurological condition (e.g. , dystonia, hemiplegia, spasticity, epilepsy, myopathy, muscular dystrophy ) \n■ severe neuropsychiatric condition (e.g. , schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Tourette syndrome, self - injurious behavior, reverse sleep -\nwake cycles )  \n■ family history strongly suggestive of a genetic etiology, including consanguinity  \n■ laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism \n● Alternate etiologies have been considered and ruled out when possible (e.g., environmental exposure, injury, infection), AND  \n● Clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single - gene \nor targeted panel testing (e.g., comparative genomic hybridization [CGH]/chromosomal microarray analysis [CMA]) is available, AND  \n● WES is more efficient and economical than the separate single -gene tests or panels \nthat would be recomme nded based on the differential diagnosis (e.g., genetic \nconditions that demonstrate a high degree of genetic heterogeneity), AND \n● A diagnosis cannot be made by standard clinical work - up, excluding invasive \nprocedures such as muscle biopsy, AND  \n● Predicted i mpact on health outcomes, as above, AND  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  15 \n \n● Pre- and post-test counseling by an appropriate provider (as deemed by the Health \nPlan\n policy), such as an American Board of Medical Genetics or American Board of \nGenetic Counseling - certified Genetic Counselor\nRapid Exome Sequencing  \nKingsmore SF, Cakici JA, Clark MM et al. 2019  \nThis report is from the NSIGHT2 study, a prospective randomized, controlled, blinded trial (RCT) \nin acutely ill infants, primarily from the NICU, PICU, and CVICU at Rady Children’s Hospi tal, \nSan Diego (RCHSD) to compare the effectiveness and outcomes between rWGS and rWES, with analysis as singleton probands and familial trios. The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available. They suggest that there should be predicted impact on health outcomes, including immediate impact on medical manag ement based on the \nmolecular results.

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022).

The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available. They suggest that there should be predicted impact on health outcomes, including immediate impact on medical manag ement based on the \nmolecular results.

Testing of one available parent should be done if both are not \nimmediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  Duo testing is an \nalternate option (child and one parent*) if only one parent is available.   \n \n*a biological sibling may be considered as a substitute if a parent is unavailable.   \n \nRapid Sequencing \nIn the NSIGHT1 trial (Petrikin, 2018) rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS) provided time to \nprovisional diagnosis by 10 days with time to final report of approximately 17 days although the \ntrial required confirmatory testing of WGS results which lengthened the time to rWGS diagnosis \nby 7–10 days. The WGS was performed in ‘rapid run’ mode with minimum depth of 90 Gb per \ngenome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold. \nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and, in the NICU or PICU, when the \ntest is ordered but may be discharged before results are delivered. \nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using \nchromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within rWGS if the test is validated for CNV \nanalysis. \nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, include but are not \nlimited to any of the following: \n Choanal atresia \n Coloboma \n Hirschsprung disease \n Meconium ileus \n \nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic \nphenotype include, but are not limited to, any of the following: \n Abnormal newborn screen \n Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis \n Hyperammonemia \n Lactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion \n Refractory or severe hypoglycemia \n \nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include, but not limited to, any of the \nfollowing: \n Significant hypotonia \n Persistent seizures \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 4  \n Infant with high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief resolved unexplained event \n(BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features: \no Recurrent events without respiratory infection \no Recurrent witnessed seizure like events \no Required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \no Significantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate \nor lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other tests that suggest an inborn error \nof metabolism \n Significantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible \nchannelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or structural heart disease \n Family history of: \no Arrhythmia \no BRUE in sibling \no Developmental delay \no Inborn error of metabolism or genetic disease \no Long QT syndrome (LQTS) \no Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- \nor second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant \n \nBRUE \nBrief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) was previously known as apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE). In a practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is \ndefined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports \na sudden, brief (usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the \nfollowing: \n Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing \n Altered level of responsiveness \n Cyanosis or pallor \n Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia) \nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting \nan appropriate history and physical examination.  Note: More information is available at: \nhttps://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590 . \n \nGenetic Nomenclature Update \nThe Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants \nfound in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022).

The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available. They suggest that there should be predicted impact on health outcomes, including immediate impact on medical manag ement based on the \nmolecular results.

A chromosomal microarray (CMA) was previously performed and was nondiagnostic. There is a family history of an inborn error of metabolism affecting an older sibling, and the parents have had multiple sessions with a genetic counselor. Given the late-gestation identification of a significant cardiac malformation and the nondiagnostic CMA, whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued to evaluate for an underlying genetic etiology that could inform perinatal and postnatal management, with coverage through UHC noted.\n\nInsurance Policy Document (source: BCBS_FEP_204102 Whole Exome and.pdf)\nFEP Medical Policy Manual\nFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic\nDisorders\nAnnual Effective Policy Date: July 1, 2024\nOriginal Policy Date: December 2013\nRelated Policies:\n2.04.105 - Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy\n2.04.109 - Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\n2.04.132 - Genetic Testing for Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies\n2.04.59 - Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\n2.04.89 - Genetic Testing for the Diagnosis of Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies\nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nDescription\nDescription\nWhole exome sequencing (WES) sequences the portion of the genome that contains protein-coding DNA, while whole genome sequencing (WGS)\nsequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. Whole exome sequencing and WGS have been proposed  for use in patients presenting\nwith disorders and anomalies not explained by a standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a\nbroad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether whole exome or whole genome sequencing improves the net health outcome in\nindividuals with suspected genetic disorders.\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility .

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Lead to changes in medication management; AND/OR  \n2. Lead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests \nare avoided; AND/OR  \n3. Lead to changes in reproductive decision-making.  \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other indications. There is \ninsufficient evidence to support a general conclusion concerning the health outcomes or \nbenefits associated with this procedure.  \nPolicy Guidelines \nApplication of Medically Necessary Policy Statement  \nAlthough there is no standard definition of epileptic encephalopathies, they are generally \ncharacterized by at least some of the following: (1) onset in early childhood (often in infancy); (2) \nrefractory to therapy; (3) associated with developmental delay or regression; and (4) severe \nelectroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities. There is a challenge in defining the population \nappropriate for testing given that specific epileptic syndromes may be associated with different \nEEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe \nseizures prior to the onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However, for this \npolicy, the medically necessary policy statement would apply for patients with: \n1. Onset of seizures in early childhood (i.e., before the age of 5 years); AND  \n2. Clinically severe seizures that affect daily functioning and/or interictal EEG \nabnormalities; AND POLICY  PRODUCT VARIATIONS  DESCRIPTION/BACKGROUND  \nRATIONALE  DEFINITIONS   BENEFIT VARIATIONS  \nDISCLAIMER  CODING INFORMATION  REFERENCES  \nPOLICY HISTORY     \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 2  \n3. No other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient’s symptoms.  \nIncluded Tests/Conditions \nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that is possibly genetic.  In 2010, the International \nLeague Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as having underlying genetic cause or etiology \nwhen, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic \ndefect and seizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or \nmetabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy. The updated 2017 ILAE classification system does \nnot discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause. \nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (e.g., Dravet syndrome, early infantile \nepileptic encephalopathy, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and \nintellectual disability limited to females, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and others). Other \nclinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes but are generally secondary to the \nepilepsy itself. \nExcluded Tests and Conditions \nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of \nsymptomatology, of which seizures may be one, such as the neurocutaneous disorders (e.g., \nneurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral \nmalformations or abnormal cortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. \nGenetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed in other policies (see Cross-\nreference section).  \nTesting that is limited to genotyping of CYP450  genes is addressed separately (MP 2.234). \nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B*1502 allelic variant in patients \nof Asian ancestry prior to considering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe \ndermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) labeling for carbamazepine. \nThis policy also does not address the use of testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA \npolymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically suspected mitochondrial disorders \nprior to initiation of therapy with valproate. Valproate’s label contains a black box warning \nrelated to increased risk of acute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients \nwith POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA labeling states: “Valproate \nis contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by variants in \nmitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG; e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) and children \nunder two years of age who are suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.  \nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and Testing Strategy \nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, are severe, and are characterized by epilepsy as the primary manifestation, without \nassociated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League \nAgainst Epilepsy, these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndrome \nassociated with a high probability of encephalopathic features that present or worsen after the \nonset of epilepsy. Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 3  \nintellectual disability, may be present secondary to the epilepsy itself. Specific clinical \nsyndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include: \n Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n[SMEI] or polymorphic myoclonic epilepsy in infancy [PMEI]) \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with intellectual disability) \n Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep \n GEFS+ syndrome (generalized epilepsies with febrile seizures plus) \n Ohtahara syndrome (also known as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst \nsuppression pattern) \n Landau-Kleffner syndrome \n West syndrome  \n Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. \nVariants in a large number of genes have been associated with early-onset epilepsies.

If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based on history, EEG findings, and \nother test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most \nlikely to be involved, followed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular, if an \nSCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+), molecular genetic \ntesting of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by \ndeletion/duplication analysis if a pathogenic variant is not identified, should be obtained.  \nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses \na multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In these cases, panels should meet the \ncriteria outlined in MP 2.323 (General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels). \nCriteria for use of whole exome sequencing are outlined in MP 2.324 (Whole Exome and Whole \nGenome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders). \nGenetics Nomenclature Update \nThe Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants \nfound in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \nPG2). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP) standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants \nrepresent expert opinion from ACMG, AMP, and the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG2.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \n \nCross-reference:  \nMP 2.234  Cytochrome P450 Genotype Guided Treatment Strategy \nMP 2.276  Genetic Testing for FMR1  Variants (Including Fragile X Syndrome) \nMP 2.323  General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels       \nMP 2.324  Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic \nDisorders  \nMP 2.326 General Approach to Genetic Testing \n \nII.

It is a common \nneurologic disorder, with approximate 3% of the population developing the disorder over their \nentire lifespan.  \nSudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as a sudden, unexpected, \nnontraumatic, and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy, excluding documented status \nepilepticus, with no cause of death identified following comprehensive postmortem evaluation.  \nClassification \nEpilepsy is heterogeneous in etiology and clinical expression and can be classified in a variety \nof ways. Most commonly, classification is done by the clinical phenotype, i.e., the type of \nseizures that occur. In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) updated its \nclassification system that is widely used for clinical care and research purposes (see Table 1). \nClassification of seizures can also be done on the basis of age of onset: neonatal, infancy, \nchildhood, and adolescent/adult. \nTable 1.

Genetic epilepsies are characterized by recurrent unprovoked \nseizures in patients who do not have demonstrable brain lesions or metabolic abnormalities. In \naddition, seizures are the core symptom of the disorder, and other symptomatology is not \npresent, except as a direct result of seizures. This is differentiated from genetically determined \nconditions in which seizures are part of a larger syndrome, such as tuberous sclerosis, fragile X \nsyndrome, or Rett syndrome. \nThe review focuses on the category of genetic epilepsies in which seizures are the primary \nclinical manifestation. This category does not include syndromes that have multiple clinical \nmanifestations, of which seizures may be one. Examples of syndromes that include seizures are \nRett syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Genetic testing for these syndromes will not be \nassessed herein but may be included in separate reviews that specifically address genetic \ntesting for that syndrome. \nGenetic epilepsies can be further broken down by type of seizures. For example, genetic \ngeneralized epilepsy refers to patients who have convulsive (grand mal) seizures, while genetic \nabsence epilepsy refers to patients with nonconvulsive (absence) seizures. The disorders are \nalso sometimes classified by the age of onset. \nThe category of genetic epilepsies includes a number of rare epilepsy syndromes that present in \ninfancy or early childhood. These syndromes are characterized by epilepsy as the primary \nmanifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. They are often \nsevere and sometimes refractory to medication treatment. They may involve other clinical \nmanifestations such as developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, which in many cases \nare thought to be caused by frequent uncontrolled seizures. In these cases, the epileptic \nsyndrome may be classified as an epileptic encephalopathy, which is described by ILAE as \ndisorders in which the epileptic activity itself may contribute to severe cognitive and behavioral \nimpairments above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology alone \nand that these can worsen over time. A partial list of severe early-onset epilepsy syndromes is \nas follows: \n Dravet syndrome \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with mental retardation) \n Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy \n GEFS+ syndrome (genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus) \n EIEE syndrome (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst) \n West syndrome \n Ohtahara syndrome \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 8  \nDravet syndrome falls on a spectrum of SCN1A- related seizure disorders, which includes febrile \nseizures at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized \ntonic-clonic seizures at the severe end. The spectrum may be associated with multiple seizure \nphenotypes, with a broad spectrum of severity; more severe seizure disorders may be \nassociated with cognitive impairment, or deterioration. Ohtahara syndrome is a severe early-\nonset epilepsy syndrome characterized by intractable tonic spasms, other seizures, interictal \nelectroencephalography abnormalities, and developmental delay. It may be secondary to \nstructural abnormalities but has been associated with variants in the STXBP1  gene in rare \ncases. West syndrome is an early-onset seizure disorder associated with infantile spasms and \nthe characteristic electroencephalography finding of hypsarrhythmia. Other seizure disorders \npresenting early in childhood may have a genetic component but are characterized by a more \nbenign course, including benign familial neonatal seizures and benign familial infantile seizures. \nGenetic Etiology \nMost genetic epilepsies are primarily believed to involve multifactorial inheritance patterns. This \nfollows the concept of a threshold effect, in which any particular genetic defect may increase the \nrisk of epilepsy but is not by itself causative. A combination of risk-associated genes, together \nwith environmental factors, determines whether the clinical phenotype of epilepsy occurs. In this \nmodel, individual genes that increase the susceptibility to epilepsy have a relatively weak \nimpact. Multiple genetic defects, and/or a particular combination of genes, probably increase the \nrisk by a greater amount. However, it is not well understood how many abnormal genes are \nrequired to exceed the threshold to cause clinical epilepsy, nor is it understood which \ncombination of genes may increase the risk more than others. \nEarly-onset epilepsy syndromes may be single-gene disorders. Because of the small amount of \nresearch available, the evidence base for these rare syndromes is incomplete, and new variants \nare currently being frequently discovered.   \nSome of the most common genes associated with genetic epileptic syndromes are listed in \nTable 2.  \nTable 2.

Ohtahara syndrome \nhas been associated with variants in STXBP1  in cases where patients have no structural or \nmetabolic abnormalities. West syndrome is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities or \ntuberous sclerosis or may be secondary to an identifiable infectious or metabolic cause, but \nwhen there is no underlying cause identified, it is thought to be due to a multifactorial genetic \npredisposition.   \nColl et al (2016) evaluated the use of a custom resequencing panel including genes related to \nsudden death, epilepsy, and SUDEP. New potential candidate genes for SUDEP were detected: \nFBN1, HCN1, SCN4A, EFHC1, CACNA1A, SCN11A, and SCN10A. \nTargeted testing for individual genes is available. Several commercial epilepsy genetic panels \nare also available. The number of genes included in the tests varies widely, from about 50 to \nover 450. The panels frequently include genes for other disorders such as neural tube defects, \nlysosomal storage disorders, cardiac channelopathies, congenital disorders of glycosylation, \nmetabolic disorders, neurologic syndromes, and multisystemic genetic syndromes. Some \npanels are designed to be comprehensive while other panels target specific subtypes of \nepilepsy. Chambers et al (2016) reviewed comprehensive epilepsy panels from 7 U.S.-based \nclinical laboratories and found that between 1% and 4% of panel contents were genes not \nknown to be associated with primary epilepsy. Between 1% and 70% of the genes included on \nan individual panel were not on any other panel. \nTreatment \nThe condition is generally chronic, requiring treatment with one or more medications to \nadequately control symptoms. Seizures can be controlled by antiepileptic medications in most \ncases, but some patients are resistant to medications, and further options such as surgery, \nvagus nerve stimulation, and/or the ketogenic diet can be used.   \nPharmacogenomics \nAnother area of interest for epilepsy is the pharmacogenomics of antiepileptic medications. \nThere are a wide variety of these medications, from numerous different classes. The choice of \nmedications, and the combinations of medications for patients who require treatment with more \nthan 1 agent is complex. Approximately one-third of patients are considered refractory to \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 10  \nmedications, defined as inadequate control of symptoms with a single medication. These \npatients often require escalating doses and/or combinations of different medications. At present, \nselection of agents is driven by the clinical phenotype of seizures but has a large trial-and-error \ncomponent in many refractory cases. The current focus of epilepsy pharmacogenomics is in \ndetecting genetic markers that identify patients likely to be refractory to the most common \nmedications. This may lead to directed treatment that will result in a more efficient process for \nmedication selection, and potentially more effective control of symptoms. \nOf note, genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry, prior to \nconsidering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions, is \nrecommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling for carbamazepine.   \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments. Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are \navailable under the auspices of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories \nthat offer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement \nAmendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has \nchosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.  \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \n \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \n \nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who \nreceive testing for genes associated with epileptic encephalopathies, the evidence includes \nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are \ntest accuracy and validity, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For Dravet syndrome, which appears to \nhave the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-\nassociated variants is high ( 80%). For other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true \nclinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However, studies reporting on \nthe overall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy \nhave reported detection rates for clinically significant variants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The \nclinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known \npathogenic variant. The presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication \nmanagement, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive planning. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in \nthe net health outcome. \nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants \nassociated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort \nstudies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, changes in \nreproductive decision making, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For most genetic epilepsies, which are \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 11  \nthought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic \nvariants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a large body of literature on associations \nbetween genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly \nunderstood. Published literature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which \nhave not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of studies have also \nreported associations between genetic variants and AED treatment response, AED adverse \neffect risk, epilepsy phenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. The largest \nnumber of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics, which has generally reported \nsome association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , \nEPHX1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 ), and  AED response. Similarly, genetic associations between a \nnumber of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported. However, no empirical \nevidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the \nchanges in clinical management that might occur as a result of testing are not well defined. The \nevidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nN/A \n \nVI.

P OLICY               \nGenetic testing for genes associated with infantile- and early-childhood onset epilepsy \nsyndromes in individuals with infantile- and early-childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes in which \nepilepsy is the core clinical symptom (see Policy Guidelines section) may be considered \nmedically necessary if positive test results may: \n \n1. Lead to changes in medication management; AND/OR  \n2. Lead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests \nare avoided; AND/OR  \n3. Lead to changes in reproductive decision-making.  \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other indications. There is \ninsufficient evidence to support a general conclusion concerning the health outcomes or \nbenefits associated with this procedure.  \nPolicy Guidelines \nApplication of Medically Necessary Policy Statement  \nAlthough there is no standard definition of epileptic encephalopathies, they are generally \ncharacterized by at least some of the following: (1) onset in early childhood (often in infancy); (2) \nrefractory to therapy; (3) associated with developmental delay or regression; and (4) severe \nelectroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities. There is a challenge in defining the population \nappropriate for testing given that specific epileptic syndromes may be associated with different \nEEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe \nseizures prior to the onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However, for this \npolicy, the medically necessary policy statement would apply for patients with: \n1. Onset of seizures in early childhood (i.e., before the age of 5 years); AND  \n2. Clinically severe seizures that affect daily functioning and/or interictal EEG \nabnormalities; AND POLICY  PRODUCT VARIATIONS  DESCRIPTION/BACKGROUND  \nRATIONALE  DEFINITIONS   BENEFIT VARIATIONS  \nDISCLAIMER  CODING INFORMATION  REFERENCES  \nPOLICY HISTORY     \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 2  \n3. No other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient’s symptoms.  \nIncluded Tests/Conditions \nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that is possibly genetic.  In 2010, the International \nLeague Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as having underlying genetic cause or etiology \nwhen, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic \ndefect and seizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or \nmetabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy. The updated 2017 ILAE classification system does \nnot discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause. \nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (e.g., Dravet syndrome, early infantile \nepileptic encephalopathy, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and \nintellectual disability limited to females, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and others). Other \nclinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes but are generally secondary to the \nepilepsy itself. \nExcluded Tests and Conditions \nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of \nsymptomatology, of which seizures may be one, such as the neurocutaneous disorders (e.g., \nneurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral \nmalformations or abnormal cortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. \nGenetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed in other policies (see Cross-\nreference section).  \nTesting that is limited to genotyping of CYP450  genes is addressed separately (MP 2.234). \nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B*1502 allelic variant in patients \nof Asian ancestry prior to considering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe \ndermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) labeling for carbamazepine. \nThis policy also does not address the use of testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA \npolymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically suspected mitochondrial disorders \nprior to initiation of therapy with valproate. Valproate’s label contains a black box warning \nrelated to increased risk of acute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients \nwith POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA labeling states: “Valproate \nis contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by variants in \nmitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG; e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) and children \nunder two years of age who are suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.  \nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and Testing Strategy \nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, are severe, and are characterized by epilepsy as the primary manifestation, without \nassociated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League \nAgainst Epilepsy, these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndrome \nassociated with a high probability of encephalopathic features that present or worsen after the \nonset of epilepsy. Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 3  \nintellectual disability, may be present secondary to the epilepsy itself. Specific clinical \nsyndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include: \n Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n[SMEI] or polymorphic myoclonic epilepsy in infancy [PMEI]) \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with intellectual disability) \n Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep \n GEFS+ syndrome (generalized epilepsies with febrile seizures plus) \n Ohtahara syndrome (also known as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst \nsuppression pattern) \n Landau-Kleffner syndrome \n West syndrome  \n Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. \nVariants in a large number of genes have been associated with early-onset epilepsies. Some of \nthese are summarized in Table PG1. \nTable PG1.

If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based on history, EEG findings, and \nother test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most \nlikely to be involved, followed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular, if an \nSCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+), molecular genetic \ntesting of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by \ndeletion/duplication analysis if a pathogenic variant is not identified, should be obtained.  \nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses \na multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In these cases, panels should meet the \ncriteria outlined in MP 2.323 (General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels). \nCriteria for use of whole exome sequencing are outlined in MP 2.324 (Whole Exome and Whole \nGenome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders). \nGenetics Nomenclature Update \nThe Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants \nfound in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \nPG2). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP) standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants \nrepresent expert opinion from ACMG, AMP, and the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG2.

Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family.

It is a common \nneurologic disorder, with approximate 3% of the population developing the disorder over their \nentire lifespan.  \nSudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as a sudden, unexpected, \nnontraumatic, and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy, excluding documented status \nepilepticus, with no cause of death identified following comprehensive postmortem evaluation.  \nClassification \nEpilepsy is heterogeneous in etiology and clinical expression and can be classified in a variety \nof ways. Most commonly, classification is done by the clinical phenotype, i.e., the type of \nseizures that occur. In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) updated its \nclassification system that is widely used for clinical care and research purposes (see Table 1). \nClassification of seizures can also be done on the basis of age of onset: neonatal, infancy, \nchildhood, and adolescent/adult. \nTable 1.

Genetic epilepsies are characterized by recurrent unprovoked \nseizures in patients who do not have demonstrable brain lesions or metabolic abnormalities. In \naddition, seizures are the core symptom of the disorder, and other symptomatology is not \npresent, except as a direct result of seizures. This is differentiated from genetically determined \nconditions in which seizures are part of a larger syndrome, such as tuberous sclerosis, fragile X \nsyndrome, or Rett syndrome. \nThe review focuses on the category of genetic epilepsies in which seizures are the primary \nclinical manifestation. This category does not include syndromes that have multiple clinical \nmanifestations, of which seizures may be one. Examples of syndromes that include seizures are \nRett syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Genetic testing for these syndromes will not be \nassessed herein but may be included in separate reviews that specifically address genetic \ntesting for that syndrome. \nGenetic epilepsies can be further broken down by type of seizures. For example, genetic \ngeneralized epilepsy refers to patients who have convulsive (grand mal) seizures, while genetic \nabsence epilepsy refers to patients with nonconvulsive (absence) seizures. The disorders are \nalso sometimes classified by the age of onset. \nThe category of genetic epilepsies includes a number of rare epilepsy syndromes that present in \ninfancy or early childhood. These syndromes are characterized by epilepsy as the primary \nmanifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. They are often \nsevere and sometimes refractory to medication treatment. They may involve other clinical \nmanifestations such as developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, which in many cases \nare thought to be caused by frequent uncontrolled seizures. In these cases, the epileptic \nsyndrome may be classified as an epileptic encephalopathy, which is described by ILAE as \ndisorders in which the epileptic activity itself may contribute to severe cognitive and behavioral \nimpairments above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology alone \nand that these can worsen over time. A partial list of severe early-onset epilepsy syndromes is \nas follows: \n Dravet syndrome \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with mental retardation) \n Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy \n GEFS+ syndrome (genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus) \n EIEE syndrome (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst) \n West syndrome \n Ohtahara syndrome \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 8  \nDravet syndrome falls on a spectrum of SCN1A- related seizure disorders, which includes febrile \nseizures at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized \ntonic-clonic seizures at the severe end. The spectrum may be associated with multiple seizure \nphenotypes, with a broad spectrum of severity; more severe seizure disorders may be \nassociated with cognitive impairment, or deterioration. Ohtahara syndrome is a severe early-\nonset epilepsy syndrome characterized by intractable tonic spasms, other seizures, interictal \nelectroencephalography abnormalities, and developmental delay. It may be secondary to \nstructural abnormalities but has been associated with variants in the STXBP1  gene in rare \ncases. West syndrome is an early-onset seizure disorder associated with infantile spasms and \nthe characteristic electroencephalography finding of hypsarrhythmia. Other seizure disorders \npresenting early in childhood may have a genetic component but are characterized by a more \nbenign course, including benign familial neonatal seizures and benign familial infantile seizures. \nGenetic Etiology \nMost genetic epilepsies are primarily believed to involve multifactorial inheritance patterns. This \nfollows the concept of a threshold effect, in which any particular genetic defect may increase the \nrisk of epilepsy but is not by itself causative. A combination of risk-associated genes, together \nwith environmental factors, determines whether the clinical phenotype of epilepsy occurs. In this \nmodel, individual genes that increase the susceptibility to epilepsy have a relatively weak \nimpact. Multiple genetic defects, and/or a particular combination of genes, probably increase the \nrisk by a greater amount. However, it is not well understood how many abnormal genes are \nrequired to exceed the threshold to cause clinical epilepsy, nor is it understood which \ncombination of genes may increase the risk more than others. \nEarly-onset epilepsy syndromes may be single-gene disorders. Because of the small amount of \nresearch available, the evidence base for these rare syndromes is incomplete, and new variants \nare currently being frequently discovered.   \nSome of the most common genes associated with genetic epileptic syndromes are listed in \nTable 2.  \nTable 2.

Ohtahara syndrome \nhas been associated with variants in STXBP1  in cases where patients have no structural or \nmetabolic abnormalities. West syndrome is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities or \ntuberous sclerosis or may be secondary to an identifiable infectious or metabolic cause, but \nwhen there is no underlying cause identified, it is thought to be due to a multifactorial genetic \npredisposition.   \nColl et al (2016) evaluated the use of a custom resequencing panel including genes related to \nsudden death, epilepsy, and SUDEP. New potential candidate genes for SUDEP were detected: \nFBN1, HCN1, SCN4A, EFHC1, CACNA1A, SCN11A, and SCN10A. \nTargeted testing for individual genes is available. Several commercial epilepsy genetic panels \nare also available. The number of genes included in the tests varies widely, from about 50 to \nover 450. The panels frequently include genes for other disorders such as neural tube defects, \nlysosomal storage disorders, cardiac channelopathies, congenital disorders of glycosylation, \nmetabolic disorders, neurologic syndromes, and multisystemic genetic syndromes. Some \npanels are designed to be comprehensive while other panels target specific subtypes of \nepilepsy. Chambers et al (2016) reviewed comprehensive epilepsy panels from 7 U.S.-based \nclinical laboratories and found that between 1% and 4% of panel contents were genes not \nknown to be associated with primary epilepsy. Between 1% and 70% of the genes included on \nan individual panel were not on any other panel. \nTreatment \nThe condition is generally chronic, requiring treatment with one or more medications to \nadequately control symptoms. Seizures can be controlled by antiepileptic medications in most \ncases, but some patients are resistant to medications, and further options such as surgery, \nvagus nerve stimulation, and/or the ketogenic diet can be used.   \nPharmacogenomics \nAnother area of interest for epilepsy is the pharmacogenomics of antiepileptic medications. \nThere are a wide variety of these medications, from numerous different classes. The choice of \nmedications, and the combinations of medications for patients who require treatment with more \nthan 1 agent is complex. Approximately one-third of patients are considered refractory to \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 10  \nmedications, defined as inadequate control of symptoms with a single medication. These \npatients often require escalating doses and/or combinations of different medications. At present, \nselection of agents is driven by the clinical phenotype of seizures but has a large trial-and-error \ncomponent in many refractory cases. The current focus of epilepsy pharmacogenomics is in \ndetecting genetic markers that identify patients likely to be refractory to the most common \nmedications. This may lead to directed treatment that will result in a more efficient process for \nmedication selection, and potentially more effective control of symptoms. \nOf note, genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry, prior to \nconsidering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions, is \nrecommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling for carbamazepine.   \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments. Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are \navailable under the auspices of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories \nthat offer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement \nAmendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has \nchosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.  \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \n \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \n \nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who \nreceive testing for genes associated with epileptic encephalopathies, the evidence includes \nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are \ntest accuracy and validity, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For Dravet syndrome, which appears to \nhave the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-\nassociated variants is high ( 80%). For other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true \nclinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However, studies reporting on \nthe overall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy \nhave reported detection rates for clinically significant variants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The \nclinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known \npathogenic variant. The presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication \nmanagement, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive planning. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in \nthe net health outcome. \nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants \nassociated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort \nstudies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, changes in \nreproductive decision making, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For most genetic epilepsies, which are \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 11  \nthought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic \nvariants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a large body of literature on associations \nbetween genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly \nunderstood. Published literature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which \nhave not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of studies have also \nreported associations between genetic variants and AED treatment response, AED adverse \neffect risk, epilepsy phenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. The largest \nnumber of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics, which has generally reported \nsome association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , \nEPHX1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 ), and  AED response. Similarly, genetic associations between a \nnumber of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported. However, no empirical \nevidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the \nchanges in clinical management that might occur as a result of testing are not well defined. The \nevidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nN/A \n \nVI.
