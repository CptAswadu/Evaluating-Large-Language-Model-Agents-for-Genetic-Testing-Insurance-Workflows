Basis: no ordering-provider requirements listed in the policy.,Yes,Policy states CMA 'may be considered medically necessary as first-line testing' for individuals with apparent nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability; the patient has severe intellectual disability. Basis: FEP policy statement listing developmental delay/ID as covered indication.,Not Specified,The policy does not mandate completion of specific prior tests before CMA (it references guideline recommendations such as fragile X testing as part of first-tier evaluation but does not require prior testing as a coverage precondition). Basis: Policy guidelines discuss stepwise approaches but no explicit prior-test requirement for CMA coverage.,Not Specified,The policy does not set family history or consanguinity prerequisites for CMA coverage. The patient's note of a maternal aunt with an immunologic disorder is not addressed as a coverage criterion. Basis: no family-history eligibility criteria in the policy.,Not Specified,"Policy recommends formal genetic counseling and states it should be performed by experienced individuals, but it does not frame counseling as an explicit coverage requirement; patient completed pre-test counseling. Basis: policy text on genetic counseling is recommendation-focused, not a stated coverage prerequisite.",Not Specified,The policy document does not list or map CPT codes to CMA; no CPT code is specified in the provided policy text. Basis: absence of CPT code information in FEP policy.,Yes,"Under the policy, CMA 'may be considered medically necessary as first-line testing' for individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability; the patient is a 2-year-old with severe intellectual disability and CMA was ordered. No policy exclusions or unmet coverage requirements were identified.
