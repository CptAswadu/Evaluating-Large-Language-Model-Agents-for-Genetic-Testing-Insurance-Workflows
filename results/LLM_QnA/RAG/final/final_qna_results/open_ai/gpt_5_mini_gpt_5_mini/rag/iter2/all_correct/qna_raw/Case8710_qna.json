  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole exome sequencing (WES) has been requested."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy contains age-based references (e.g., features diagnosed by age 18). The patient is 12 years old, which meets the age-related criteria referenced in the policy (e.g., diagnoses required by age 18)."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The test was ordered by a developmental pediatrician per the patient information."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Not Answerable",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires specific clinical features be present (either one of the primary features or two or more of the secondary features such as autism spectrum disorder plus additional listed features). The record states ASD plus “at least one additional abnormality affecting another organ system” but does not specify which additional feature(s) are present or that the results are expected to directly influence management, so it cannot be determined from the provided information whether the policy's medical-indication criteria are met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate prior testing (e.g., CMA or karyotype) before postnatal WES in this context; it only specifies prior testing in certain prenatal or syndrome-specific circumstances. Patient had a nondiagnostic karyotype, but the policy does not require specific prior tests generally for WES in this scenario."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Answerable",
      "reasoning": "The policy lists family history (other first- or second-degree relatives with similar clinical features) as a supportive feature. The patient has a paternal uncle with dystonia/ataxia (a second-degree relative), but it is not documented that the uncle’s features are 'similar clinical features' to the patient’s phenotype, so it cannot be determined whether the family history meets the policy criterion."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is 'strongly recommended' prior to WES/WGS but does not make counseling a stated coverage requirement. The patient record documents no pre-test counseling; however, because the policy only recommends (not requires) counseling, counseling is not a coverage precondition per policy."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "The policy's Applicable Codes list maps exome sequence analysis to CPT code 81415 (Exome; sequence analysis) which corresponds to WES requested."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Per the UnitedHealthcare WES policy, coverage requires that all specified criteria be met (nonspecific presentation, appropriate ordering provider, and presence of required clinical features / indications with expectation that results will directly influence management). Although age and ordering provider criteria are met and prior karyotype was nondiagnostic, the documentation does not specify the additional organ-system abnormality or demonstrate that the required clinical-feature thresholds and expectation to influence management are met. Because the policy's medical-indication requirements cannot be confirmed from the provided information, the request is not covered per policy."
