  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information states the general pediatrician ordered whole exome sequencing (WES)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy age-related criteria include pediatric-onset features (e.g., intellectual disability or developmental delay diagnosed by age 18). The patient is 11 years old, which meets the policy's age-related constraints for pediatric WES indications."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES to be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering provider is a general pediatrician, which does not meet the policy's specified ordering-provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy coverage requires either (a) one of specified major pediatric features (e.g., moderate/severe ID, global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy) or (b) two or more listed features (one of which is autism spectrum disorder). The patient has autism spectrum disorder but no documented second qualifying feature (e.g., global developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy) in the record, so the defined medical-indication criteria are not met per the policy."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate specific prior tests (e.g., CMA or Fragile X) prior to WES in the general pediatric neurodevelopmental context; it only states targeted testing should precede WES if a specific syndrome is suspected. Fragile X was done but the policy does not explicitly require it before WES."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy specifies family-history criteria as 'other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features.' The patient has a maternal aunt with a severe immunologic disorder, but this is not documented as having similar clinical features to the proband's neurodevelopmental/ASD phenotype, so the family-history criterion for WES eligibility is not met."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy 'strongly recommends' genetic counseling prior to WES but does not make counseling a strict coverage requirement. The patient did meet the recommendation (pre-test counseling occurred), but counseling is not specified as a mandatory eligibility criterion in the policy."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Per the policy's applicable CPT codes, 81415 corresponds to 'Exome; sequence analysis' (proband), which matches the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Per the UnitedHealthcare WES policy, all required criteria must be met (including ordering-provider specialty and defined clinical indication thresholds). The ordering provider is a general pediatrician (not one of the listed specialties), and the patient documents only autism spectrum disorder without a second qualifying feature or one of the policy's major pediatric features (e.g., global developmental delay or ID), so the policy criteria for medically necessary coverage are not satisfied."
