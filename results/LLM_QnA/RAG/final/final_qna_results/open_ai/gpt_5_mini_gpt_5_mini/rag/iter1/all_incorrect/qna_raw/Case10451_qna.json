    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient was referred for whole exome sequencing (WES) by neurology to evaluate unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder (stated in the patient information)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy criterion I.A.2.a allows ES for nonsyndromic developmental delay or intellectual disability with onset prior to age 18. The patient is 10 years old with childhood-onset moderate–severe intellectual disability, meeting the age-related criterion."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires pre/post-test counseling by an appropriate provider and evaluation by a Board-Certified/Board-Eligible Medical Geneticist or APN in Genetics (Criteria F and G). The ordering provider is a neurologist and there is no documentation that the required geneticist/APGN evaluation or genetic counselor involvement occurred."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy I.A.2.a lists apparently nonsyndromic developmental delay or intellectual disability with onset before age 18 as an indication for ES. The patient has moderate–severe intellectual disability of childhood onset, meeting this medical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not explicitly mandate prior testing (e.g., CMA) as a required absolute prior test in the criteria—although guidance notes ES is often considered after nondiagnostic CMA. The patient did have a nondiagnostic CMA, but the policy does not state CMA is strictly required."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy specifies 'family history strongly suggestive of a genetic etiology, including consanguinity' as a possible criterion. The provided family history (a sibling with a brief resolved unexplained event) is not documented as 'strongly suggestive' of a genetic etiology per the policy definition."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires pre- and post-test counseling by an appropriate provider (e.g., Board-Certified Medical Geneticist, Certified Genetic Counselor, or APN in Genetics). There is no documentation of prior genetic counseling for this patient."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy reference table lists 81415 as the common CPT code for standard exome sequencing (Exome - Proband), which corresponds to the requested WES for this proband."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient meets age and medical indication (childhood-onset intellectual disability) and had nondiagnostic CMA, the policy requires pre/post-test genetic counseling and evaluation by a Board-Certified/Board-Eligible Medical Geneticist or APN in Genetics (Criteria F and G). These provider/counseling requirements are not met/documented (ordering provider is a neurologist and no counseling documented), therefore the request does not meet all required policy criteria for coverage."
