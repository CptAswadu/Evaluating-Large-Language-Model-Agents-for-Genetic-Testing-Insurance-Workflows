  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient info states the newborn 'has been referred for whole exome sequencing (WES) after karyotype testing was nondiagnostic.'"
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided FEP policy discusses postnatal testing in infants/children but does not state any explicit age-based eligibility criteria for WES."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy discusses genetic counseling and follow-up but does not specify ordering-provider specialty or other explicit provider requirements for WES."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy defines indications for chromosomal microarray and states NGS panel testing is investigational; WES (whole exome) is addressed in a separate policy (2.04.102) not provided here, so no medical-indication criteria for WES are present in this document."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy indicates a stepwise/tiered approach with CMA (and fragile X testing) as first-tier for multiple congenital anomalies; the patient had a nondiagnostic karyotype but no CMA reported, so required prior testing (CMA/first-tier testing) has not been completed per the policy's recommendations."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "While the patient has a sibling with unexplained developmental regression, the provided policy does not specify family history or consanguinity criteria that would make WES eligible under this document."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The policy states experts recommend formal genetic counseling for most cases and that counseling should be performed by someone with genetic expertise; the patient had pre-test genetic counseling completed and post-test follow-up planned, meeting this requirement."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "The requested test is whole exome sequencing (WES); among the provided CPT options, 81415 corresponds to whole exome sequencing."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The FEP policy provided does not establish coverage criteria for WES (WES is addressed in a separate policy not supplied) and classifies NGS panel testing as investigational for the indicated indications; it also designates CMA as the first-line test for multiple congenital anomalies, which has not been completed—therefore WES is not supported for coverage under the provided policy text."
