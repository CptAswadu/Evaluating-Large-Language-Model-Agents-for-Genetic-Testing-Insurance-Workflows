    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient note explicitly states 'whole exome sequencing (WES) is being requested.'"
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy coverage applies to 'children' with unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders; the patient is a 9-year-old child, meeting the age-based criterion."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy criterion #1 requires evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics and counseling; the patient had pre-test counseling with a genetic specialist, satisfying the ordering/evaluation requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in a child and prior genetic testing failed to yield a diagnosis; the patient has multiple congenital anomalies and a nondiagnostic prior karyotype, meeting the medical indication criteria."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy examples mention prior testing (eg, CMA and/or targeted single-gene testing) but do not mandate a specific prior test as an absolute prerequisite; patient had a nondiagnostic karyotype but no CMA is documented."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists family history of developmental delay as relevant; the patient has a sibling with developmental delay, which is a specified relevant family history."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires genetic counseling by an experienced provider; patient had pre-test counseling with a genetic specialist and plans for post-test follow-up, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "The requested test is whole exome sequencing (WES); CPT 81415 corresponds to exome sequencing (WES) interpretation and report."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "All policy-required elements for medically necessary standard WES are met: child with multiple congenital anomalies, evaluated/counseled by genetics specialist, prior genetic testing nondiagnostic, relevant family history—thus WES may be considered medically necessary per the policy statement."
