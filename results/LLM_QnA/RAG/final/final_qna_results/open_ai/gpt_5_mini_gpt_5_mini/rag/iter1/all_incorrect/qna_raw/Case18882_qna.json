  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information states whole exome sequencing (WES) is being requested."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy refers to 'children' but does not specify numeric age cutoffs for WES eligibility; no explicit age-based exclusion/inclusion is given for an 8-year-old."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy criterion #1 requires evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics and counseling about risks prior to testing. The ordering/referring provider is a developmental pediatrician and the record does not document evaluation by a clinical genetics expert, so the provider requirement is not met per policy."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy states WES is medically necessary for children with unexplained multiple congenital anomalies; the patient is an 8-year-old with multiple congenital anomalies affecting several organ systems, meeting the clinical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires previous genetic testing failed to yield a diagnosis (eg, CMA or targeted testing) or that a genetic etiology is likely despite prior testing. The patient had prior FISH testing that was nondiagnostic, satisfying the 'previous genetic testing failed to yield a diagnosis' criterion in the policy."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists family history of long QT syndrome as relevant. The patient’s family history includes a mother with long QT syndrome, which is a policy-specified relevant family history."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires counseling about potential risks of genetic testing by a clinician with genetics expertise. The family declined pre-test genetic counseling and only agreed to post-test counseling, so the policy's pre-test counseling requirement is not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "The requested test is whole exome sequencing (WES); CPT 81415 corresponds to clinical exome sequencing and best matches the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient meets the medical indication (multiple congenital anomalies) and prior testing was nondiagnostic, the policy requires ALL criteria be met, including evaluation and pre-test counseling by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics. That counseling/genetics-evaluation requirement was not met, therefore under the policy the test is not covered."
