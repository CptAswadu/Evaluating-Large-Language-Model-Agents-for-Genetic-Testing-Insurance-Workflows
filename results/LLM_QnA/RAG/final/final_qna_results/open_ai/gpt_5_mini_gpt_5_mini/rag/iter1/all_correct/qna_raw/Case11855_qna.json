    "Q0": {
      "answer": "CMA",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states chromosomal microarray (CMA) is being ordered to assess for copy number variants."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The UnitedHealthcare CMA policy does not impose an age cutoff for testing; it describes indications across prenatal, pediatric and adult settings but does not specify age-based eligibility criteria that would exclude a 14-year-old."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy strongly recommends pre/post-test genetic counseling by qualified genetics personnel but does not mandate a specific provider specialty to place the CMA order; no explicit ordering-provider restriction is stated."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy coverage rationale lists specific covered indications (ASD, isolated severe congenital heart disease, multiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated syndrome, developmental delay/intellectual disability). The patient has a congenital anomaly affecting a single organ system without documentation of DD/ID, ASD, multiple anomalies, or isolated severe CHD, so the defined medical indications are not met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The AAN/other guidance in the policy states targeted testing (e.g., Fragile X/FMR1) when indicated should be negative prior to CMA; the patient had prior Fragile X testing that was nondiagnostic, satisfying this prior-test expectation."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy only specifies family-related indications such as testing a parent/sibling of a child with an abnormal/equivocal CMA; the patient's family history (maternal aunt with breast cancer) does not match the family-history criteria for CMA eligibility."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy strongly recommends pre-test genetic counseling and AAN guidance requires face-to-face counseling/consent; the patient received pre-test counseling with a genetic specialist and plans for post-test follow-up were made, meeting counseling expectations."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81228",
      "reasoning": "The policy lists CPT 81228 for genome-wide cytogenomic analysis (CGH microarray) for constitutional copy number variant detection, which corresponds to the requested CMA."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Based on the UnitedHealthcare CMA coverage rationale the test is medically necessary only for the listed indications (ASD, isolated severe CHD, multiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated syndrome, developmental delay/ID, etc.). The patient has a single-organ congenital anomaly without documented DD/ID, ASD, multiple anomalies, or isolated severe CHD, so the coverage criteria are not met and the test is not covered per policy."
