  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states 'Whole exome sequencing (WES) is being ordered.' Decision based solely on provided patient data."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy criteria reference pediatric age windows (e.g., features diagnosed by 18 years, global developmental delay onset <5 years). Patient is 2 years old, which meets the age-related windows referenced in the WES coverage criteria."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES to be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering/referring provider is a developmental pediatrician, meeting the policy requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists multiple congenital anomalies and developmental delay/global developmental delay as qualifying clinical features for WES. The patient has multiple congenital anomalies and ongoing developmental concerns, and prior karyotype was nondiagnostic, meeting the medical indication criteria in the policy."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not require a specific prior test (e.g., CMA/karyotype) for postnatal WES in all cases; it only states targeted testing is preferred if a specific syndrome is suspected and prenatal WES requires prior CMA/karyotype. Although the patient had a nondiagnostic karyotype, the policy does not specify mandatory prior testing for this postnatal WES scenario."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy identifies consanguinity or other first-/second-degree family members with similar clinical features as relevant criteria. The patient has a maternal history of Long QT syndrome, which is not the same clinical features as the proband's congenital anomalies/developmental concerns, so the specific family-history eligibility criteria are not met."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy 'strongly recommends' genetic counseling prior to WES/WGS but does not list counseling as a mandatory coverage criterion. Patient documentation notes pre-test genetic counseling was completed, but the policy does not make counseling a required coverage condition."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy's applicable CPT codes list 81415 for exome (sequence analysis) for a proband, which corresponds to WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under the UnitedHealthcare WES coverage rationale, WES is medically necessary when ordered by a qualifying provider and when features such as multiple congenital anomalies or global developmental delay are present. The patient is a 2-year-old with multiple congenital anomalies and developmental concerns, WES ordered by a developmental pediatrician, and prior karyotype was nondiagnostic — collectively meeting the policy's coverage criteria."
