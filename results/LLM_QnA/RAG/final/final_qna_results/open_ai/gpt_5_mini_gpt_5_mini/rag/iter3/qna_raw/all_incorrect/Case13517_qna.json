  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient note explicitly states 'whole exome sequencing (WES) was ordered.' Basis: patient clinical information."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy specifies WES coverage criteria for 'children' and the patient is 16 years old (a child). Basis: policy statement that standard WES may be medically necessary for children and patient age = 16."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy criterion 1 requires evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics (including family history and phenotype) and counseling. The record shows referral by a developmental pediatrician and pre-test counseling by a genetic counselor but does not document evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics; therefore ordering-provider requirement is not met per policy."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy limits standard WES to evaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children. The patient presents with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (an abnormal lab) and a sibling with suggestive labs, but no documented unexplained congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorder in the patient; rapid WES criteria that list conjugated hyperbilirubinemia apply to critically ill NICU/PICU infants, which this 16-year-old is not. Basis: policy statements and guidelines."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires prior appropriate genetic testing (e.g., chromosomal microarray and/or targeted single-gene testing) unless other criteria apply. The only prior test documented is Fragile X testing (nondiagnostic), not the CMA/targeted testing named; therefore required prior testing per policy is not documented as completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists family history of an inborn error of metabolism as a relevant family-history criterion. The patient has a sibling with laboratory abnormalities suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism, meeting the family-history criterion in the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy states genetic counseling should be performed and is part of criterion 1. The record documents pre-test counseling completed with a genetic counselor and post-test counseling planned, satisfying the counseling requirement."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "The ordered test is whole exome sequencing (WES); the CPT code that best corresponds to clinical exome sequencing is 81415 (exome sequence analysis). Basis: mapping of requested WES to standard exome CPT code."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Per the policy, standard WES is medically necessary only for children with unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders who meet ALL listed criteria (including evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics and appropriate prior testing). This patient does not have documented unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder, is not a critically ill infant eligible for rapid WES, lacks documented evaluation by a clinical genetics clinician, and has incomplete prior genetic testing per policy. Therefore WES is not covered under the policy for this situation."
