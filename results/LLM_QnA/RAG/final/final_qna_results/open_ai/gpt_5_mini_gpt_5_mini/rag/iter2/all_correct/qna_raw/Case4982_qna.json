  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient is being considered for whole exome sequencing per the clinical note ('being considered for whole exome sequencing (WES)')."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy includes age‑based feature thresholds (e.g., diagnoses by age 18, epileptic encephalopathy onset <3). The patient is 11 years old (pediatric) and therefore within applicable age-based criteria where specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The patient was referred by a developmental pediatrician, satisfying the ordering‑provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy allows WES when clinical history suggests a genetic cause and two or more listed features are present. The patient has a congenital anomaly (Hirschsprung disease) and a first‑degree relative (sibling) with early epileptic encephalopathy, meeting the 'two or more features' criterion."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate specific prior testing (e.g., CMA/karyotype) prior to WES in non‑prenatal cases; it only advises targeted testing if a specific syndrome is suspected. The patient had prior nondiagnostic FISH, but the policy does not list mandatory prior tests for WES."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'other first‑ or second‑degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' (and consanguinity) as a criterion. The patient has a sibling with epileptic encephalopathy (first‑degree relative), which is relevant."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy states genetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to WES/WGS. The family has met with a genetic counselor multiple times for pre‑test counseling and planned post‑test counseling, satisfying the counseling expectation."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy's Applicable Codes list CPT 81415 for exome (sequence analysis), which corresponds to WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under the policy WES is medically necessary when ordered by an approved specialist and the clinical history suggests a genetic cause with required features. The test is ordered by a developmental pediatrician, the presentation is nonspecific, and the patient meets criteria (congenital anomaly + affected first‑degree relative), so coverage is supported."
