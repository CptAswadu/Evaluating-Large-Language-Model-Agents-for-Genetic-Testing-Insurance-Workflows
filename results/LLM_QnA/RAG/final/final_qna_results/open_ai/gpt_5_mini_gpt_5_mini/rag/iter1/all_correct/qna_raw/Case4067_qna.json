    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states \"whole exome sequencing (WES) has been ordered.\""
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy includes age-specific criteria (e.g., global developmental delay onset prior to 5 years; intellectual disability diagnosed by 18 years; hypotonia specified as \"in infancy\"). The patient is 5 years old with hypotonia but does not clearly meet the policy's age‑specific feature definitions (hypotonia in infancy or documented GDD onset <5), so age‑related criteria are not met per policy."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The test was ordered by a developmental pediatrician, which meets the provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy coverage requires either (A) one of the first-tier features (e.g., global developmental delay, ID diagnosed by 18) or (B) two or more features from the second list (e.g., congenital anomaly, hypotonia in infancy, neuromuscular disorder, family members with similar features). The record documents only significant hypotonia and a nondiagnostic karyotype; hypotonia alone (and not specified as infancy) does not satisfy the defined clinical criteria."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate prior CMA/karyotype for outpatient WES (prenatal WES has specific prior-test requirements). Although the patient had a nondiagnostic karyotype, the policy does not specify a required prior test sequence for non‑prenatal WES beyond targeted testing if a specific syndrome is suspected."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy specifies family history qualifying criteria as consanguinity or first/second‑degree family members with similar clinical features. The patient has a paternal uncle with sudden unexplained death (a second‑degree relative) but no documentation of a similar clinical phenotype, so the documented family history does not meet the policy's specified family-history criterion."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is \"strongly recommended\" prior to WES/WGS but does not make counseling an absolute coverage requirement; no genetic counseling information is provided in the patient data."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Applicable codes in the policy list CPT 81415 for exome (sequence analysis), which corresponds to WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although ordering provider and coding align with policy, the patient does not meet the policy's specified medical indication criteria for outpatient WES (policy requires either one of the primary features such as global developmental delay/ID or two or more features from the secondary list; the record documents only hypotonia and nondiagnostic karyotype). Therefore, under the policy the test is not covered."
