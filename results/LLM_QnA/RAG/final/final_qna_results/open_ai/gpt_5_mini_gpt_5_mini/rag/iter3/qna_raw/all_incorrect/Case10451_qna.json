  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient clinical information explicitly states the neurologist referred the 10-year-old for whole exome sequencing (WES)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy standard exome sequencing is indicated for developmental delay/intellectual disability with onset prior to age 18; the patient is a 10-year-old with childhood-onset moderate–severe ID, meeting the age-related criterion."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires evaluation by a Board‑Certified/Board‑Eligible Medical Geneticist or an Advanced Practice Nurse in Genetics and pre-/post-test counseling by an appropriate genetics provider; the ordering provider is a neurologist and there is no documentation the patient was evaluated by a geneticist/APGN, so provider requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability (onset <18 years) as an indication for standard exome sequencing; the patient has unexplained moderate–severe intellectual disability and prior CMA was nondiagnostic, satisfying the medical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not explicitly mandate a specific prior test (e.g., CMA) as an absolute requirement for standard exome sequencing, although it notes WES is appropriate after CMA or focused testing is unrevealing. Thus prior-test requirements are not explicitly specified."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy includes ‘family history strongly suggestive of a genetic etiology, including consanguinity’ as a criterion. The patient has a sibling with a brief resolved unexplained event, but the documentation does not indicate a family history that is 'strongly suggestive' of a genetic etiology or consanguinity, so the family-history criterion is not met."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires pre- and post-test genetic counseling by an appropriate provider (geneticist, certified genetic counselor, or APN in genetics). The clinical information states there is no documentation of prior genetic counseling, so counseling requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy references CPT 81415 as the common code for standard exome sequencing (proband/trio), which corresponds to the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient meets indication and age criteria and prior CMA was nondiagnostic, the policy requires pre-/post-test counseling and evaluation by a Board‑Certified/Board‑Eligible Medical Geneticist or APGN. Those provider/counseling criteria are not documented, therefore the full policy coverage criteria are not met."
