    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) was requested for the infant."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy age criterion for genome-wide testing is specified via the WES criteria for individuals <18 years; the patient is 7 weeks old (<18), so the age criterion is met (policy I.2 and I.1)."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Answerable",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires evaluation by an ABMGG board-certified medical geneticist or an ABGC board-certified genetic counselor for WES/WGS pathways (II.1.a). Patient record notes pre-test genetic counseling but does not specify the counselor's ABGC/ABMGG credentials, so adequacy cannot be confirmed from provided information."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy defines as an indication unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in persons <18 (II.1). The infant has multiple congenital anomalies affecting multiple organ systems identified at birth, which meets the defined clinical indication for genome-wide testing."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy states WGS MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA only when WES has been performed and was unable to identify a causative mutation (II.4). The patient has not had WES (only Fragile X testing nondiagnostic), so the required prior testing (WES) has not been completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy references family history in certain prenatal/recurrence contexts but does not list family history or consanguinity as a required criterion for WGS in this non‑prenatal infant scenario (II). The provided family history (sibling with ASD) is not a stated explicit requirement for coverage here."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Answerable",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires pre-test counseling by an ABMGG medical geneticist or ABGC board‑certified genetic counselor for WES/WGS pathways (II.1.a). Patient notes pre-test genetic counseling was completed but does not state the counselor's certification, so compliance with the policy's counseling/provider credential requirement cannot be confirmed."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "The requested test is whole genome sequencing (WGS); among the provided CPT options, 81425 corresponds to whole genome sequencing (WGS)."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Per policy, WGS is covered only when WES has been performed and failed to identify a causative mutation and all WES criteria are met (II.4). The patient has not had WES; therefore the requested WGS does not meet the policy's coverage pathway and is not covered."
