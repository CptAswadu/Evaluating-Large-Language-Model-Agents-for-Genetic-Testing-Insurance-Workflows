    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is being considered."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The UnitedHealthcare policy does not set an explicit age cutoff for WGS eligibility; examples include neonates but no age-based exclusion or required age is specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WGS be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician; the ordering provider is a neonatologist, satisfying this requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy coverage for WGS requires (among other items) a nonspecific clinical presentation and one of the feature-sets (or two+ of a secondary list). The infant has nonspecific neonatal cholestasis being evaluated for metabolic/genetic etiology (clinical presentation not fitting a well-defined syndrome) and has at least two relevant features from the policy's list: laboratory abnormality suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia/cholestasis) and a first‑degree family history of unexplained developmental regression. Thus the clinical indication criteria are met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy for WGS requires that neither CMA nor WES have been performed; the record documents prior karyotype (nondiagnostic) but no CMA or WES, so the prior-test requirement for WGS is satisfied."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists family history (other first- or second-degree family members with similar clinical features) and unexplained developmental regression among relevant features. The patient has a sibling with unexplained developmental regression, which is relevant to eligibility per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is \"strongly recommended\" prior to WES/WGS but does not make documented pretest genetic counseling a formal coverage requirement; the record documents no pretest genetic counseling but counseling is not specified as a hard coverage criterion."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Policy's Applicable Codes list CPT 81425 for genome (whole genome) sequence analysis; this corresponds to WGS being requested."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under the UnitedHealthcare WGS coverage rationale, requirements are met: WGS is ordered by a neonatologist; clinical presentation is nonspecific and a genetic cause is suspected; neither CMA nor WES have been performed; and the patient meets listed features (laboratory abnormality suggestive of IEM and relevant family history). Therefore WGS is medically necessary and covered per the policy."
