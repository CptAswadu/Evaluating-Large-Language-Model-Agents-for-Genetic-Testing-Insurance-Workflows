  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient clinical information explicitly states testing was referred for whole genome sequencing (WGS)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy includes age-based language (infants/children) for WGS when done rapidly in critically ill infants; the patient is a neonate (an infant), so the patient meets the policy's age descriptor for infant/child."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics and counseling; the patient was referred by a medical geneticist and had pre-test counseling by a genetic counselor, meeting ordering/provider requirements in policy."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy limits medically necessary WGS to rapid WGS for critically ill infants in NICU/PICU meeting specified criteria. The record does not state the neonate is critically ill or in NICU/PICU, so the patient does not meet the specific medical indication for WGS per the policy."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy specifies prior genetic testing requirements for standard WES (eg, CMA/targeted testing) but does not specify explicit prior-test requirements for WGS outside the rapid critically ill context; the policy text does not clearly define required prior tests for the requested (non-rapid) WGS."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists family history of an inborn error of metabolism as relevant; the patient has a sibling with an inborn error of metabolism, satisfying the family-history criterion."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires genetic counseling as part of evaluation; the patient completed pre-test counseling with a genetic counselor, meeting the counseling requirement."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided BCBS_FEP policy document does not specify CPT/billing codes for WGS or map the requested test to a CPT code; therefore a specific CPT cannot be determined from the policy text."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Per the policy, WGS is only considered medically necessary as a rapid test for critically ill infants in NICU/PICU meeting specific criteria; standard (non-rapid) WGS in other situations is considered investigational. The record does not indicate the neonate is critically ill/in NICU, so the requested WGS is not covered under this policy."
