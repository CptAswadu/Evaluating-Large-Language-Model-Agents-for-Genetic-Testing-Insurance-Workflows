  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "BRCA1/2",
      "reasoning": "Patient explicitly was referred for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing per the clinical information."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists personal history of breast cancer diagnosed ≤45 years as a medical-necessity criterion; patient is 35 at diagnosis, so she meets the age-based criterion."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy requires testing be performed in a setting with suitably trained providers able to give pre/post-test counseling but does not restrict testing to a specific ordering provider specialty; the chart does not document that the gynecologist is a trained genetics provider."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy medical-indication criteria include a personal history of breast cancer diagnosed ≤45 years and/or a close relative with pancreatic cancer; the patient has both a breast cancer diagnosis at age 35 and an uncle with pancreatic cancer, satisfying policy indications."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate completion of specific prior tests (the patient did have a nondiagnostic karyotype, which the policy does not list as a required prior test)."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists a close blood relative with pancreatic cancer as a relevant family-history criterion; the patient reports an uncle (a 2nd-degree close relative) with pancreatic cancer."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy specifies testing should occur in a setting that can provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling; the patient has no record of pre-test genetic counseling, so counseling requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy document does not provide CPT/mapping codes for BRCA1/2 testing, so a best-fit CPT code cannot be determined from the provided policy text."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "On adjudication of coverage criteria in the policy, the patient meets medical-necessity criteria for BRCA1/2 testing (personal history of breast cancer diagnosed ≤45 years and relevant family history). The policy also requires testing be done in a setting that can provide pre/post-test counseling; lack of documented pre-test counseling should be addressed operationally but does not negate that the patient meets coverage criteria."
