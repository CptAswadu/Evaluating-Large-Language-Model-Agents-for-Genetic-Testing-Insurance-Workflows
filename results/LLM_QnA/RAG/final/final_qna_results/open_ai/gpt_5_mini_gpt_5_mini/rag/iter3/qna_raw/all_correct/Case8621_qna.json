  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient info states the child is undergoing whole exome sequencing (WES)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy includes age-related feature thresholds (e.g., DD/ID diagnosed by age 18, GDD onset <5). The patient is 2 years old and therefore meets the policy's age-related feature windows for pediatric neurodevelopmental indications."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering provider is the child’s oncologist, which does not meet the specified ordering-provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires either (a) clinical history strongly suggests genetic cause plus one primary feature (e.g., GDD, moderate/severe ID) or (b) clinical history strongly suggests genetic cause plus two or more listed features (autism is one). The record documents autism but does not explicitly document a second qualifying feature (e.g., global developmental delay, dysmorphic features, consanguinity, similar affected first/second‑degree relative with similar clinical features), so the specified medical-indication criteria are not clearly met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The WES coverage criteria do not mandate completion of a prior specific test (postnatal WES criteria do not require prior CMA). The patient did have CMA nondiagnostic, but the policy does not require CMA before WES for outpatient postnatal testing."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Patient reports an uncle with a congenital anomaly. The policy lists 'other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' and consanguinity as relevant family-history criteria; an uncle is a second-degree relative and thus constitutes family history per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy states genetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to WES/WGS but does not list counseling as a formal coverage requirement. The patient has had pre-test genetic counseling, but counseling is not a stated mandatory coverage criterion."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy applicable codes list 81415 for exome (sequence analysis) for a proband; this best corresponds to the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient is pediatric with autism and prior nondiagnostic CMA (factors relevant to WES), the policy explicitly requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering provider is an oncologist, so the ordering-provider requirement is not met and coverage per the policy is not supported."
