  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy applies to children; patient is 17 years old (under 18), satisfying 'children' criteria for WES per the policy and ACMG guidance cited in the policy."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics and counseling; patient was referred to medical genetics, the medical geneticist is coordinating testing, and pre-test genetic counseling occurred."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder; patient has global developmental delay/lifelong cognitive and adaptive deficits (a neurodevelopmental disorder) and the phenotype is unexplained, meeting the medical indication in the policy."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy allows WES when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis; patient had prior FISH testing that was nondiagnostic, meeting the 'previous testing failed' criterion."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy notes family history (eg, developmental delay, epileptic disorders) as relevant; patient has a sibling with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, which is relevant per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires genetic counseling/documentation of counseling; patient saw a genetic counselor for pre-test counseling and will return for post-test counseling, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided policy document does not specify CPT/billing codes for WES; no CPT guidance is given in the policy text."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Per the policy, standard WES may be considered medically necessary for children with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders when ALL criteria are met. Patient (17yo) meets criteria: evaluated by genetics and counseled, unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder, prior genetic testing nondiagnostic, and potential for management change implied by genetic diagnosis."
