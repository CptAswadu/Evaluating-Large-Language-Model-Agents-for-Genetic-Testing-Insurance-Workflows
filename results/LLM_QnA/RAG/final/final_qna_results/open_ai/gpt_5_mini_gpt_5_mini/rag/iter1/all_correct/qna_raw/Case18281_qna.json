  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient clinical info states the cardiologist ordered whole genome sequencing (WGS)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The UnitedHealthcare WGS policy does not impose an explicit age cutoff for WGS eligibility; age-specific items exist for some features (e.g., ID diagnosed by 18 years) but no absolute age restriction preventing a 6-year-old from WGS is specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WGS to be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician; the ordering provider here is a cardiologist, which does not meet the listed ordering-provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'multiple congenital anomalies (must affect different organ systems)' as an indication for WGS. The patient is a 6-year-old with multiple congenital anomalies that do not fit a well-delineated syndrome, which matches the clinical criterion."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy states WGS is appropriate when 'Neither CMA nor WES have been performed.' Patient history documents only Fragile X testing (nondiagnostic) and no prior CMA or WES, satisfying this prior-test requirement."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy specifies family-history criteria such as 'other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' or consanguinity. The patient has a sibling with an inborn error of metabolism, which is not documented as 'similar clinical features' for the proband and consanguinity is not present; thus the policy-specified family/consanguinity criteria are not met."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is 'strongly recommended' prior to WGS but does not make pretest genetic counseling a listed mandatory coverage requirement; the patient had no prior counseling, but the policy does not explicitly require it for coverage."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Policy's Applicable Codes list CPT 81425 for 'Genome (e.g., unexplained constitutional or heritable disorder or syndrome); sequence analysis,' which corresponds to WGS as requested."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient meets medical-indication criteria (multiple congenital anomalies) and has not had CMA/WES, the policy additionally requires WGS be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering provider is a cardiologist, so the ordering-provider requirement is unmet and coverage under this policy would be denied."
