  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy defines age-based application to infants/neonates (rapid sequencing indications apply to neonatal/pediatric ICU). The patient is a neonate, so the age criterion (being an infant/neonate) is met per the policy's age scope for neonatal/pediatric sequencing."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics (including family history and phenotype description) and counseling prior to standard testing. The patient was referred by a neurologist and there is no documentation of evaluation by a clinical genetics specialist; family declined genetic counseling."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'multiple congenital anomalies' as a qualifying clinical criterion for rapid WES/WGS and for consideration of WES in unexplained congenital anomalies. The neonate has multiple congenital anomalies affecting several organ systems, so the medical-indication criterion is met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "For standard WES the policy requires prior genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray analysis and/or targeted single-gene testing) or prior testing failing to yield a diagnosis. The patient had FISH only (nondiagnostic); there is no documentation of CMA or targeted single-gene testing, so required prior testing has not been completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy guidance lists relevant family history (eg, developmental delay or genetic disease in family) as pertinent. The patient has an older sibling with multiple congenital anomalies, which is relevant per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy states genetic counseling should be performed by someone with expertise and is part of the requirements for standard testing. The family declined genetic counseling, so counseling requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided policy document does not list or map CPT codes to WGS or WES; therefore a best-fit CPT code is not specified in the policy text."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Per the policy, whole genome sequencing is covered as rapid WGS only for critically ill infants in the NICU/PICU meeting specific criteria. The neonate is not documented as critically ill or in NICU/PICU, prior required testing (eg, CMA) and genetic counseling/clinical genetics evaluation are not documented. The policy states WGS is investigational in other situations, so the requested WGS is not covered."
