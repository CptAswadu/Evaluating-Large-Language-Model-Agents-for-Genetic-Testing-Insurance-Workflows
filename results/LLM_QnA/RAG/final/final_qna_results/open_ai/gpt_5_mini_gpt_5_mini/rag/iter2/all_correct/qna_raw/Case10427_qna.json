  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient clinical info explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) is being requested."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy age-related features include 'hypotonia in infancy' as an accepted criterion for WGS; the patient is an 8‑week‑old infant with significant hypotonia, meeting the age-related feature per the WGS coverage rationale."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WGS be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician; the ordering provider is a neurologist, satisfying this requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "WGS coverage criteria require a nonspecific presentation and one (or two) listed features; the infant has nonspecific significant hypotonia (listed: 'Hypotonia or hypertonia in infancy') and family history of unexplained developmental regression — meeting the medical indication per the policy."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The WGS coverage criteria state 'Neither CMA nor WES have been performed' as a condition for WGS; patient had only nondiagnostic FISH and has not had CMA or WES, satisfying this prior‑test requirement."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists family history (other first/second‑degree members with similar features) and 'Unexplained developmental regression' as relevant features; patient has an older sibling with unexplained developmental regression, which is relevant per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy 'strongly recommends' genetic counseling prior to WES/WGS; the patient had pre‑test counseling with a genetic counselor on multiple occasions and post‑test follow‑up is planned, meeting the counseling recommendation in the policy."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Policy's applicable codes list CPT 81425 for 'Genome (e.g., unexplained constitutional or heritable disorder or syndrome); sequence analysis' corresponding to WGS."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under the UnitedHealthcare WGS coverage rationale the request meets all required elements: WGS ordered by an allowed specialist (neurologist); clinical presentation nonspecific with an accepted feature (hypotonia in infancy) and supporting family history; and neither CMA nor WES have been performed. Therefore WGS is covered per the policy."
