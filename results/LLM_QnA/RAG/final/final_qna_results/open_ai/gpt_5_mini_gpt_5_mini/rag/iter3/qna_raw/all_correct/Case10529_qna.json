  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states 'whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued.'"
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'Moderate, severe, or profound Intellectual Disability diagnosed by 18 years of age' and the patient is 6 years old, meeting the age-based criterion in the WES coverage rationale."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The patient was referred by neurology and WES is being pursued via neurology, satisfying ordering-provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy medical-indication criteria include Global Developmental Delay and Intellectual Disability (onset <18 years) as qualifying features. The patient has nonsyndromic developmental delay and intellectual disability, meeting these clinical indications."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The WES coverage criteria do not universally require prior tests (except when a specific syndrome is suspected or for prenatal WES where CMA/karyotype must be uninformative). The patient had Fragile X testing (nondiagnostic), but the policy does not mandate additional specific prior testing for outpatient WES in this scenario."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy counts 'other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' as a relevant feature. The patient has a maternal uncle with neurologic disease (dystonia and ataxia), a relevant second-degree family history."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy states genetic counseling is 'strongly recommended' prior to WES/WGS but does not state it as a strict coverage requirement. The patient has completed pre-test genetic counseling and plans post-test follow-up, but the policy language is recommendation rather than a mandatory condition."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Applicable CPT codes in the policy list 81415 for 'Exome; sequence analysis,' which corresponds to WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Based on the policy, WES is proven and medically necessary when (a) presentation is nonspecific and not fitting a defined syndrome, (b) ordered by an authorized provider (neurologist), and (c) one of the qualifying features is present (the patient has developmental delay/intellectual disability and relevant family history). Fragile X was nondiagnostic and pre-test genetic counseling completed. These facts meet the policy's coverage rationale for WES."
