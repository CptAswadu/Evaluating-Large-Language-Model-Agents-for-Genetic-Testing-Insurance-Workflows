    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient information states whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is being considered to identify a genetic cholestatic/metabolic etiology."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not impose an overall age exclusion for WGS; age-based items are present for specific features (e.g., ID diagnosed by 18) but there is no explicit age cutoff that would exclude a one-week-old neonate."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WGS be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician; the ordering provider is a neonatologist, which meets the policy requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires: (1) clinical presentation nonspecific and (2) ordered by an approved provider and (3) presence of listed features. The neonate has suspected genetic cholestatic/metabolic disease (nonspecific presentation), is ordered by a neonatologist, and has laboratory abnormality suggestive of an IEM (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia) plus a first-degree relative with unexplained developmental regression—meeting the feature requirements in the policy for WGS."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy condition for WGS is that neither CMA nor WES have been performed. The patient had a nondiagnostic karyotype only; no CMA or WES was performed, satisfying the policy's prior-testing requirement for WGS."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists relevant family history (other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features / unexplained developmental regression) as a qualifying feature; the patient has a sibling with unexplained developmental regression."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to WES/WGS but does not make pretest genetic counseling an explicit required coverage criterion; the chart documents no pretest counseling but the policy does not mandate it as a coverage requirement."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Policy's applicable CPT codes list 81425 for genome (whole genome) sequence analysis; the requested test is WGS."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under the UnitedHealthcare WES/WGS policy, WGS is medically necessary when clinical presentation is nonspecific, ordered by an approved provider (neonatologist), neither CMA nor WES have been performed (only karyotype done), and qualifying features are present (laboratory abnormality suggestive of an IEM and relevant family history). The patient's facts meet these policy criteria, supporting coverage."
