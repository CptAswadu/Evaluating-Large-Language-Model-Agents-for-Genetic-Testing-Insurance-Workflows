  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole exome sequencing (WES) is being requested as the next diagnostic step."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided policy addresses CMA as first-line in children but does not state age-based eligibility criteria specific to WES; WES is noted to be addressed in a separate policy."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy discusses genetic counseling but does not specify ordering-provider specialty or other provider-type requirements for WES in this document."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "This policy defines indications for CMA and states NGS panels are investigational; it does not define clinical indication criteria for WES (WES is addressed in a separate policy)."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy-guidelines recommend a stepwise first tier including CMA and fragile X testing for developmental delay/ID; the patient had nondiagnostic FISH but no CMA or fragile X testing documented, so required prior testing has not been completed per this policy."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "While the patient has a family history (affected brother), the policy does not specify family history or consanguinity as an eligibility criterion for WES in this document."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The policy states formal genetic counseling is recommended/should be performed when genetic testing is considered; the patient completed pre-test genetic counseling with plans for post-test follow-up, meeting the policy's counseling expectation."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided policy document does not list or map specific CPT codes to WES or other genetic tests."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Under this policy CMA is the medically necessary first-line test for apparent nonsyndromic developmental delay/ID and NGS panel testing is labeled investigational; WES is addressed in a separate policy not provided here. Given the absence of CMA prior testing and that experimental/investigational services are not covered per the Benefit Application, WES is not supported as covered by this policy."
