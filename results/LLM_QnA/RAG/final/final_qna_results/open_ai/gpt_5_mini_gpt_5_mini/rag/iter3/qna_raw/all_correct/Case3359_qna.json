  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states 'Whole exome sequencing (WES) is being requested.'"
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Patient is 4 years old. The policy includes age-referenced criteria such as global developmental delay onset prior to 5 years and features diagnosed by 18 years; a 4-year-old child meets the age-related thresholds referenced in the WES coverage criteria."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES to be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering provider is a developmental pediatrician, which meets the policy requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires clinical history suggesting a genetic cause plus specific features. The patient has significant hypotonia and ongoing developmental concerns and a first-degree relative (sibling) with developmental delay — meeting at least two listed features (hypotonia and other family member with similar features) under the WES indications."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The WES coverage criteria do not mandate completion of specific prior tests for postnatal WES (prenatal WES requires prior CMA/karyotype). Although CMA was previously performed and nondiagnostic for this patient, the policy does not require prior testing before WES in this context."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'Other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' and 'consanguinity' as relevant criteria. Patient has a sibling with developmental delay (first-degree), which is a specified relevant family-history criterion."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy states genetic counseling is 'strongly recommended' prior to WES/WGS but does not state it as a required coverage condition. The patient did receive pre-test counseling, but the policy does not make counseling a strict coverage requirement."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy's applicable CPT codes list 81415 for exome (e.g., unexplained constitutional or heritable disorder or syndrome) sequence analysis, which corresponds to WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under the policy, WES is proven and medically necessary when ordered by an approved specialist and the clinical history suggests a genetic cause with qualifying features. The ordering provider is a developmental pediatrician and the patient has qualifying features (hypotonia + affected sibling), so the policy criteria for coverage are met."
