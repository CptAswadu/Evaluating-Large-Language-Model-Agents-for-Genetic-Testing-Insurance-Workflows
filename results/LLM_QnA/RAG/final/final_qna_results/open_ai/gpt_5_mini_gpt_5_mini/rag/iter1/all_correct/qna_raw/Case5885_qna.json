  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) is requested."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not impose an absolute age limit for WGS; it references age-related diagnostic criteria (e.g., ID diagnosed by 18) but no explicit age-based eligibility cutoff. The patient is 11 and no age exclusion applies per policy."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WGS be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The test was requested by/through neurology, meeting the ordering-provider requirement (policy: Coverage Rationale for WGS)."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy coverage for WGS requires clinical presentation that suggests a genetic cause plus specified features (e.g., multiple congenital anomalies, global developmental delay, moderate–severe ID, or two or more listed features). The patient has a 'major abnormality affecting at least one organ system' but no documentation of the required listed features (multiple congenital anomalies, ID/GDD, epilepsy, two or more of the enumerated features, consanguinity, or another family member with similar features). Thus the defined medical indications are not met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy states WGS is proven/medically necessary when 'neither CMA nor WES have been performed.' Patient has only prior Fragile X testing (nondiagnostic) and no record of prior CMA or WES, satisfying the policy prerequisite for WGS."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists family history (other first/second-degree with similar clinical features) and consanguinity as relevant features. The patient has a maternal history of long QT syndrome, which is not documented as 'similar clinical features' to the proband, and no consanguinity—so relevant family/consanguinity criteria are not met per policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy 'strongly recommends' genetic counseling prior to WGS. Patient information documents pre-test counseling was discussed with a genetic specialist and post-test follow-up plans are in place, meeting the counseling expectation in the policy."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Policy's applicable CPT codes list 81425 for 'Genome (e.g., unexplained constitutional or heritable disorder or syndrome); sequence analysis,' which corresponds to WGS."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although ordering provider and prior-test and counseling conditions are met, the policy requires specific clinical indications (e.g., multiple congenital anomalies, GDD/ID, epilepsy onset <3y, or two or more listed features) to support WGS. The patient's record documents a major single-organ abnormality without the required listed features or family history of similar phenotype; therefore WGS does not meet the policy's medical necessity criteria and is not covered."
