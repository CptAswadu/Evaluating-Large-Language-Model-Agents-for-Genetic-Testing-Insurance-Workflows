  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient info states 'Whole exome sequencing (WES) is being requested' for evaluation of developmental concerns; matches WES in the policy."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy includes age-related criterion of global developmental delay with onset prior to 5 years as an indication for WES. The patient is 4 years old, which meets the policy's age-related criterion for GDD/onset <5 years."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES to be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering provider is a developmental pediatrician, meeting the policy requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires nonspecific presentation plus either (A) one major feature (e.g., GDD) or (B) two or more listed features. The child has nonspecific developmental concerns with significant hypotonia and a first-degree relative (sibling) with developmental delay — two listed features in the policy — meeting the medical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The WES coverage criteria do not mandate completion of specific prior tests (except targeted testing if a specific syndrome is suspected). Although the patient had a nondiagnostic CMA, the policy does not require CMA prior to WES for this indication."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'Other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' as a relevant criterion. The patient has a sibling with developmental delay (first-degree), which is relevant per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is 'strongly recommended' prior to WES/WGS but does not list pre-test counseling as a mandatory coverage requirement. Patient had pre-test counseling, but counseling is not a stated coverage criterion."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy applicable CPT codes list 81415 for exome (sequence analysis), which corresponds to the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Per the policy, WES is medically necessary when ordered by an allowed provider and clinical criteria are met. The test is ordered by a developmental pediatrician, the child has nonspecific developmental presentation with hypotonia and a first-degree relative with similar features (two policy-listed features), and age is appropriate — therefore coverage criteria are satisfied."
