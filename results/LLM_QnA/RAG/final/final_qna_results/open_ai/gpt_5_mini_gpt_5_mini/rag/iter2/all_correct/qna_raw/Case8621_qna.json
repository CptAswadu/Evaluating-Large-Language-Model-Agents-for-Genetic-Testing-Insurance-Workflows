  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole exome sequencing (WES) is being performed to seek a unifying diagnosis."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Patient is 2 years old; the policy’s WES indications include pediatric-onset criteria (e.g., global developmental delay with onset prior to 5 years and intellectual disability diagnosed by age 18). The patient’s age (2) satisfies those age-based thresholds in the policy."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The test was ordered by the child’s oncologist, who is not among the listed authorized ordering providers."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists neurodevelopmental disorders/autism as qualifying features for WES (autism spectrum disorder is among listed features supporting WES). The patient has a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with autism and is being evaluated after nondiagnostic CMA, meeting the clinical indication in the policy."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate a specific prior test (e.g., CMA) as a universal prerequisite for WES in non‑prenatal cases. The patient did have prior CMA that was nondiagnostic, but the policy does not require a specific prior test be completed before WES."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists family history (other first- or second-degree family members with similar clinical features) and consanguinity as relevant features. The family reports an uncle with a congenital anomaly (a second-degree relative), which constitutes a relevant family history per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to WES/WGS. The family reports multiple meetings with a genetic counselor and that pre-test counseling was completed with plans for post-test follow-up, satisfying the counseling recommendation."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "The policy's applicable CPT codes list 81415 for exome (sequence analysis) for a proband; this best corresponds to the requested WES for the child."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient’s clinical presentation (neurodevelopmental disorder with autism), age, prior nondiagnostic CMA, family history, and completed genetic counseling align with the policy’s clinical indications for WES, the policy requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering provider is an oncologist, so the ordering-provider requirement is not met and coverage is not supported under the policy."
