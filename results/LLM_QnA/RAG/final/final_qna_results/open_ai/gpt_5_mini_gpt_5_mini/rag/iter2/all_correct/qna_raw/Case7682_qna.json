  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient record explicitly states whole exome sequencing (WES) is being requested."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy criteria reference pediatric indications (e.g., features diagnosed by age 18). The patient is 9 years old, which meets the age-related criteria (under 18) cited in the WES policy."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering provider is a developmental pediatrician, which satisfies the requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'multiple congenital anomalies (must affect different organ systems)' and 'other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' as qualifying features. The patient has multiple congenital anomalies affecting different organ systems and a sibling with developmental delay, meeting the clinical indications."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate specific prior tests for postnatal WES. The record notes a nondiagnostic karyotype, but the policy does not require prior CMA/karyotype as a universal prerequisite for WES in this non‑prenatal setting."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' and 'consanguinity' as relevant family-history criteria. The patient has a sibling with developmental delay, which is relevant under the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy states genetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to WES; the record documents pre-test counseling with a genetic specialist and plans for post-test follow-up, meeting the counseling recommendation."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy applicable CPT codes list 81415 for exome sequence analysis (proband). WES corresponds to CPT 81415 (with comparator codes listed separately if parent/sibling exomes are submitted)."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "All policy coverage criteria are met: WES is ordered by an allowed specialist (developmental pediatrician), the patient has multiple congenital anomalies affecting different organ systems and a relevant affected sibling (policy qualifying features), pre-test genetic counseling was performed, and the request is for diagnostic evaluation. Therefore WES is medically necessary per the UnitedHealthcare WES coverage rationale."
