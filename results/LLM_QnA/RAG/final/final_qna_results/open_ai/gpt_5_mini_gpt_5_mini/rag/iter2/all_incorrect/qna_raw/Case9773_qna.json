  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "CMA",
      "reasoning": "Patient info explicitly states a chromosomal microarray (CMA) was ordered to assess for copy number changes."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy does not impose age limits for diagnostic testing in symptomatic individuals; the patient is symptomatic (2-year-old with severe intellectual disability) but no age-specific eligibility criteria are specified for CMA."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate a specific ordering provider specialty for germline testing; it only ties the genetic counseling requirement to whether a disease-specialist ordered the test. No explicit ordering-provider restriction is stated."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy states testing meets coverage when the individual is currently symptomatic with suspicion of a known genetic disease where mutation knowledge will assist diagnosis/treatment. The child has severe intellectual disability and suspicion of an underlying genetic etiology, meeting this criterion."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not list specific required prior tests before CMA for this clinical scenario; patient has no prior genetic testing but the policy does not require particular prior testing."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy references family history for asymptomatic/risk-based testing, but does not define family-history/consanguinity requirements specific to CMA in symptomatic patients. Although a maternal aunt with an immunologic disorder is noted, the policy does not specify this as a requirement for coverage here."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires genetic counseling prior to testing if not ordered by a disease specialist. The family completed pre-test genetic counseling (and plans post-test counseling), satisfying the counseling requirement."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy's reimbursement section addresses use of multigene panel codes and unlisted molecular pathology codes but does not specify CPT code mapping for chromosomal microarray (CMA); none of the provided CPT options are specified in the policy for CMA."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under the policy, germline/genomic testing meets coverage when the patient is symptomatic and testing will assist diagnosis/management. The child has severe intellectual disability with suspected genetic etiology, no conflicting policy exclusions apply, and required pre-test genetic counseling was completed, supporting coverage."
