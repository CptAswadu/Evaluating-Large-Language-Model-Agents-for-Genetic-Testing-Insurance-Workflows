    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) is being requested."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy specifies age-based criteria for pediatric evaluation (<18 years) for genome/exome sequencing; the patient is 9 years old, meeting the age criterion (policy Section II.1: \"individuals less than 18 years of age\")."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Answerable",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires evaluation/counseling by an ABMGG board-certified medical geneticist or an ABGC board-certified genetic counselor (Section II.1.a). The chart states a \"pre-test discussion with a genetic specialist\" but does not document the provider's ABMGG/ABGC certification, so sufficiency cannot be confirmed from the provided information."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy allows WGS only when WES was unable to identify a causative mutation and clinical suspicion remains (Section II.4). The patient has not had WES per the provided information, so the policy-defined medical indication for WGS is not met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES (and/or prior tests) before WGS when clinical criteria apply (Section II.4 and II.5). The patient has had fragile X testing but has not had WES; therefore the required prior test (WES) before WGS has not been completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not list family history/consanguinity as a specific mandatory eligibility criterion for pediatric WGS in Section II.1; although the patient has a maternal uncle with an immunologic disorder, the policy's core WGS/WES pediatric criteria do not hinge on this family history."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Answerable",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires pre-test counseling by an ABMGG board-certified medical geneticist or an ABGC board-certified genetic counselor (Section II.1.a). The record notes a pre-test discussion with a \"genetic specialist\" but does not document the required ABMGG/ABGC credentialing or that counseling covered the required elements, so this cannot be confirmed."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "The requested test is Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS); CPT code 81425 corresponds to WGS (best match for the requested whole-genome test)."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Per policy, WGS MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA only when WES was performed and unable to identify a causative mutation and clinical suspicion persists (Section II.4). The patient has not had WES (only fragile X testing), and required prior testing/sequence pathway has not been satisfied; therefore WGS is not covered under the policy for this request."
