    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information states whole exome sequencing (WES) was requested for fetal evaluation at 22 weeks."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy age-related eligibility applies to pediatric individuals under 21 and the Policy Guidelines explicitly exclude prenatal (fetal) testing; this is a 22‑week gestation fetus and therefore does not meet the policy's age/setting criteria."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics and counseling; patient had pre-test discussion with a genetic specialist, meeting the provider/counseling requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists evaluation of unexplained multiple congenital anomalies as an indication and allows WES when previous genetic testing is nondiagnostic; patient has multiple structural anomalies and Fragile X testing was nondiagnostic, meeting medical indication criteria (regardless of prenatal exclusion)."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate a specific prior test universally; it allows WES when previous genetic testing is nondiagnostic or when preferred testing is not appropriate. Although Fragile X was nondiagnostic, the policy does not define a specific required prior test for this scenario."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy examples include relevant family history as part of indications; patient has a maternal aunt with dysmorphic features, which is relevant to eligibility per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires genetic counseling by an experienced provider; patient had pre-test discussion with a genetic specialist, satisfying the counseling requirement."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy coding lists 81415 among covered procedure codes 'when medically necessary' for whole exome sequencing; 81415 corresponds to exome sequencing."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although clinical indications and provider/counseling criteria are met, the policy explicitly states it does not address prenatal (fetal) testing. Therefore WES for this 22‑week fetus is not covered under the provided policy."
