    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states 'whole exome sequencing (WES) has been ordered.'"
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not impose a single overall age cutoff for WES; age limits are only specified for certain clinical features (e.g., ID diagnosed by age 18). The infant’s age alone is not an explicit eligibility requirement in the WES coverage criteria."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Answerable",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES to be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The patient info states referral by a PCP and that pre-test counseling occurred with a genetic specialist, but it does not explicitly state which clinician placed the WES order, so insufficient information to determine compliance with ordering-provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy coverage requires either (A) clinical history strongly suggesting a genetic cause plus one primary feature (e.g., global developmental delay, multiple congenital anomalies) or (B) clinical history strongly suggesting a genetic cause plus two or more secondary features (the secondary list includes ASD among many others). The infant has concern for ASD only (one secondary feature) and no documented additional qualifying features (family history of an aunt with a congenital anomaly is present but is not documented as a similar phenotype in a first/second-degree relative). Thus the defined medical-indication criteria in the policy are not met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate a specific prior test (e.g., CMA) universally before WES for neurodevelopmental indications; it only advises targeted testing first when a specific syndrome is suspected. The patient had prior Fragile X testing (nondiagnostic), but the policy does not specify that particular prior testing is required for WES in this scenario."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The policy lists 'Other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' and 'consanguinity' among features relevant to WES eligibility. The patient has a family history (maternal aunt with a congenital anomaly), i.e., a second-degree relative, which is family-history information relevant to the policy criteria."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is 'strongly recommended' prior to WES/WGS but does not list pre-test counseling as an explicit required coverage criterion. The patient did have pre-test counseling with a genetic specialist, but counseling is not a formal required condition for coverage per the policy."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy 'Applicable Codes' maps exome sequence analysis to CPT 81415 (Exome; sequence analysis), which corresponds to the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Per the UnitedHealthcare WES coverage rationale, WES is covered only when the patient meets the specified clinical criteria (e.g., one primary qualifying feature or two or more secondary features and ordered by specified specialists). The infant has only concern for ASD (one secondary feature) and a remote family history (a maternal aunt with a congenital anomaly) but does not meet the policy-defined threshold of clinical features; additionally, the ordering provider type is not documented. Based on the policy criteria and the supplied patient facts, coverage criteria are not met."
