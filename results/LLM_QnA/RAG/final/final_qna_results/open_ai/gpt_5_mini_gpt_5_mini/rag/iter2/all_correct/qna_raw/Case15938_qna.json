    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient info states whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is being considered; the request is explicitly for WGS."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not impose a specific minimum/maximum age that would exclude a one-week-old; age-based cutoffs in the policy apply to specific phenotypes (e.g., ID diagnosed by 18 years, seizure onset <3 years) but no blanket age exclusion for WGS is specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WGS be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician; the ordering provider is a neonatologist, which meets the requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy coverage for WGS requires (among other things) that the clinical history strongly suggests a genetic cause plus either (A) one of the major features (multiple congenital anomalies, moderate/severe ID by 18, global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy) OR (B) two or more of the listed secondary features (e.g., laboratory abnormalities suggestive of an IEM, hypotonia, unexplained developmental regression, family members with similar features, etc.). The patient has a laboratory abnormality suggestive of an IEM (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia) but does not have a second qualifying feature in the proband (the sibling's developmental regression is not the same clinical feature as the infant), so the medical-indication criteria are not met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires for WGS that neither CMA nor WES have been performed. Patient had a nondiagnostic karyotype but no CMA or WES, so this prior-test condition is satisfied."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy lists family history (other first- or second-degree members with similar clinical features) as a qualifying feature. The patient has a sibling with unexplained developmental regression, but that is not a family member with 'similar clinical features' to the infant's presentation (neonatal cholestasis/IEM concern), so the family-history criterion relevant to eligibility is not met."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is 'strongly recommended' prior to WES/WGS but does not state a documented pretest genetic counseling requirement as a strict coverage prerequisite; the patient has no documented pretest counseling, but counseling is not specified as mandatory for coverage in the policy."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Policy applicable codes list 81425 = Genome (sequence analysis) for unexplained constitutional/heritable disorder, which corresponds to clinical WGS."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the ordering provider (neonatologist) and the prior-test condition (no CMA/WES performed) meet policy requirements, the patient does not meet the medical-indication criteria per the policy (only one secondary feature — lab abnormality suggestive of an IEM — without a second qualifying feature or a listed major feature). Therefore coverage is not supported under the policy."
