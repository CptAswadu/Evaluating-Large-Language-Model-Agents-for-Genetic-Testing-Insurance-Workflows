  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient summary explicitly states the patient is being considered for whole exome sequencing (WES)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy: standard WES/WGS medically necessary for pediatrics under 21. Patient is 11 years old, meeting the age requirement (policy: <21 years)."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Answerable",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires the individual be evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics. Patient info documents referral by a developmental pediatrician and genetic counseling visits, but does not state that a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics performed an evaluation, so available information is insufficient to confirm this requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy: WES indicated for unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder when prior genetic testing is non-diagnostic. Patient has Hirschsprung disease (an example listed in policy) and prior FISH testing was nondiagnostic, meeting the medical indication criteria."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists prior non-diagnostic genetic testing as an acceptable criterion. Patient had prior FISH testing that was nondiagnostic, satisfying this prior test requirement."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists relevant family history (e.g., developmental delay, early epilepsy) as pertinent. Patient has a sibling with epileptic encephalopathy before age 3, which is relevant family history per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires genetic counseling; patient/family met with a genetic counselor multiple times for pre-test counseling and plans post-test disclosure, satisfying the counseling requirement documented in the policy."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy coding: 81415 is listed among covered codes for whole exome sequencing (WES) when medically necessary; this best corresponds to the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient meets age, medical indication (Hirschsprung + nondiagnostic prior testing), prior testing, counseling, family-history criteria, the policy also requires evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics. The patient information does not document such an evaluation, so not all required policy elements are documented and the test cannot be determined covered per the policy."
