The record documents recurrent seizure‑like events but does not document clinically severe seizures affecting daily functioning, refractory course, or EEG abnormalities, so the defined medical indication is not met.",Not Specified,"The policy discusses testing strategies (targeted testing, panels) and references separate criteria for WES (related policy), but it does not define a mandatory set of prior tests required before WES in this policy text.",Not Specified,"The policy does not require specific family history or consanguinity for eligibility; although a family neurologic history is provided, the policy does not define family-history criteria for coverage in this document.",Yes,"Policy recommends formal genetic counseling performed by experienced personnel.

The chart documents persistent seizures but does not provide seizure onset age, severity details vs daily functioning, or EEG results, so medical-indication criteria cannot be confirmed.",Not Specified,"The policy describes testing strategies (targeted gene testing, panels, and reference to WES criteria in a related policy) but does not mandate specific prior tests required before WES; therefore no explicit prior-test requirement is specified in this policy.",Not Specified,"Although the patient has a family history (uncle with sudden unexplained death <35), the policy does not list family history or consanguinity as explicit eligibility criteria for genetic testing for epilepsy.",Yes,"Policy recommends formal genetic counseling by experienced personnel. The patient has had multiple visits with a genetic counselor and arranged post-test genetics follow-up, which meets the counseling expectations described in the policy.",Not Specified,The policy document does not provide or map CPT codes to tests. No CPT code is specified in the provided policy text for WES.,No,"Per the policy, genetic testing is medically necessary for infantile/early-childhood-onset epilepsies with onset before age 5 plus other criteria. The record lacks documentation of seizure onset before age 5 and other required clinical details (EEG severity/no alternative syndrome).

No explicit ordering-provider restriction is stated.,Yes,"Policy states testing meets coverage when the individual is currently symptomatic with suspicion of a known genetic disease where mutation knowledge will assist diagnosis/treatment. The child has severe intellectual disability and suspicion of an underlying genetic etiology, meeting this criterion.",Not Specified,The policy does not list specific required prior tests before CMA for this clinical scenario; patient has no prior genetic testing but the policy does not require particular prior testing.,Not Specified,"Policy references family history for asymptomatic/risk-based testing, but does not define family-history/consanguinity requirements specific to CMA in symptomatic patients. Although a maternal aunt with an immunologic disorder is noted, the policy does not specify this as a requirement for coverage here.",Yes,"Policy requires genetic counseling prior to testing if not ordered by a disease specialist. The family completed pre-test genetic counseling (and plans post-test counseling), satisfying the counseling requirement.",Not Specified,The policy's reimbursement section addresses use of multigene panel codes and unlisted molecular pathology codes but does not specify CPT code mapping for chromosomal microarray (CMA); none of the provided CPT options are specified in the policy for CMA.,Yes,"Under the policy, germline/genomic testing meets coverage when the patient is symptomatic and testing will assist diagnosis/management.

Patient history states 'diagnosed at age 50 or younger' which is ambiguous relative to the policy thresholds (≤45 vs 46–50 with additional criteria), so insufficient information to determine if age criterion is met.",Not Specified,The policy does not specify required ordering provider specialty/type for BRCA1/2 testing; no ordering-provider restrictions are given in the document.,Not Answerable,"The policy defines specific clinical indications. Patient has a personal breast cancer history diagnosed at '50 or younger' but the policy's categories are age-specific and some (46–50) require additional criteria the patient does not clearly have. Because the exact age at diagnosis and presence of required additional qualifiers are not determinable from the provided information, medical-indication status cannot be confirmed.",Not Specified,"The policy does not require completion of any specific prior tests before BRCA1/2 testing (it notes prior limited testing is relevant but not required), so no mandatory prior-test requirement is specified.",No,"The policy specifies family-history criteria for eligibility (e.g., close blood relative with breast/ovarian/pancreatic/prostate cancer).
