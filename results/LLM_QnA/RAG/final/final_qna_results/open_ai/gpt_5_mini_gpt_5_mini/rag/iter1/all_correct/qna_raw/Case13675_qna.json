  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient information states 'whole genome sequencing (WGS) is being pursued' — WGS is the explicitly requested test."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy criteria for pediatric indications reference features 'diagnosed by 18 years of age.' Patient is an 8‑week‑old infant, which meets the age context for pediatric WGS criteria."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UnitedHealthcare policy requires WGS be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The ordering/referring provider is a neonatologist, meeting the policy requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires either (A) one or more primary features (e.g., multiple congenital anomalies, severe ID, global DD, early epileptic encephalopathy) or (B) two or more listed features (e.g., congenital anomaly, significant hearing/visual impairment, etc.). The infant has significant congenital hearing/visual impairment (one feature) but no second listed feature or any primary feature documented, so medical‑necessity criteria are not met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "WGS coverage criteria state it is proven/medically necessary when 'Neither CMA nor WES have been performed.' Patient’s prior testing was nondiagnostic FISH; there is no documentation of prior CMA or WES, satisfying the criterion that neither CMA nor WES have been performed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists consanguinity or 'other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' as relevant. The family history documents a father with long QT syndrome, which is not a similar clinical feature to the infant's hearing/visual impairment and no consanguinity is reported, so the policy’s family-history criteria are not met."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy 'strongly recommends' pre‑test genetic counseling prior to WES/WGS but does not list pre‑test counseling as a mandatory coverage criterion. The record notes no documented pre‑test counseling, but counseling is not a specified required coverage criterion in the policy."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "UnitedHealthcare's applicable codes list maps 'Genome (e.g., unexplained constitutional or heritable disorder or syndrome); sequence analysis' to CPT code 81425, which corresponds to WGS."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although age and ordering provider requirements are met and neither CMA nor WES were performed (per policy), the policy requires either one of the primary features or two or more of the secondary features. The infant has only one listed secondary feature (significant hearing/visual impairment) and no other required clinical features, so the WGS request does not meet the policy's medical‑necessity coverage criteria."
