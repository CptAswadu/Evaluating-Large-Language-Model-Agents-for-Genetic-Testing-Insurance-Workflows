    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information states the child is undergoing whole exome sequencing (WES)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not impose a strict age limit for WES; it lists age-dependent diagnostic features (e.g., ID diagnosed by 18, GDD onset <5, seizures onset <3) but no absolute age exclusion — the 2-year age is not directly constrained by the policy."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UnitedHealthcare policy requires WES to be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician. The test was ordered by the child’s oncologist, which does not meet the specified ordering-provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires either (A) one major feature (e.g., global developmental delay, multiple congenital anomalies, moderate–severe ID, or early epileptic encephalopathy) or (B) two or more listed features (e.g., autism plus another feature). The record documents autism only (and an uncle with a congenital anomaly), so the explicit medical-necessity criteria in the policy are not met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The WES coverage criteria do not mandate prior testing (CMA is not required before WES); although CMA was performed and nondiagnostic in this case, the policy does not define a required prior-test sequence for WES."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The policy lists family history (other first- or second-degree relatives with similar features) and consanguinity as relevant criteria. The family reports an uncle with a congenital anomaly (a second-degree relative), which is a documented relevant family history per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to WES; the family has met with a genetic counselor multiple times with pre-test counseling completed and plans for post-test follow-up, satisfying the counseling recommendation."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy applicable CPT codes list 81415 for exome (sequence analysis); WES corresponds to CPT 81415."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient’s phenotype (neurodevelopmental disorder with autism) and completed genetic counseling are relevant, the policy explicitly requires WES to be ordered by specified specialists (medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician). The test was ordered by an oncologist and the medical-necessity criteria (one major feature or two or more listed features) are not clearly met; therefore coverage is not supported per the policy."
