  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information states 'whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued' — the requested test is explicitly WES."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided BCBS_FEP_20459 policy does not state age-based eligibility for whole exome sequencing; the policy notes WES is addressed in a separate policy (2.04.102)."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy document does not specify ordering-provider specialty or credential requirements for WES; WES is referred to a different policy (2.04.102)."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The current policy defines medical indications for CMA (developmental delay/ID, ASD, multiple congenital anomalies) and states WES is addressed separately; it does not specify clinical indication criteria for WES in this document."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient had CMA which the policy identifies as first-line for developmental delay/ congenital anomalies, the policy does not state specific required prior testing before WES here (WES is handled in a separate policy)."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not define family-history or consanguinity criteria specific to WES; while the patient has a positive family history (older sibling with multiple congenital anomalies), the document does not specify this as an eligibility criterion for WES in this policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling 'should be performed' by experienced personnel for inherited-condition testing. The patient had pre-test counseling with a genetic counselor and post-test follow-up planned, meeting the policy's counseling expectation."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided policy text does not map or list CPT codes for whole exome sequencing; WES coverage is referenced to a separate policy, so no CPT code is specified here."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Based solely on this policy document: whole exome sequencing is not addressed in this policy (it is handled in a separate policy 2.04.102), and the policy states that next-generation sequencing panel testing is considered investigational for children with developmental delay/ID/ASD/congenital anomalies. Therefore, under this policy text alone, WES is not supported as covered."
