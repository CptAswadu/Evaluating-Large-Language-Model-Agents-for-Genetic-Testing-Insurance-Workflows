  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient was referred for whole exome sequencing (WES) per the clinical information; request is explicitly WES."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not impose an overall age cutoff for WES; age-related items (e.g., ID diagnosed by 18 years) are criteria elements but there is no discrete age exclusion that would make a 15‑year‑old ineligible."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires WES be ordered by a medical geneticist, neonatologist, neurologist, or developmental pediatrician; the test was ordered/referred by neurology, meeting the provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires clinical history suggesting a genetic cause plus specific features. The patient has a congenital anomaly and a first‑degree family history of an inborn error of metabolism (sibling), meeting two listed features that support WES per policy."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy does not mandate specific prior tests before WES (aside from targeted testing if a specific syndrome is suspected); although the patient had a nondiagnostic CMA, the policy does not require prior testing as a universal prerequisite."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'other first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar clinical features' and consanguinity as relevant criteria. The patient has a sibling with an inborn error of metabolism, which is relevant family history per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy states genetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to WES/WGS but does not make counseling a strict mandatory coverage requirement; the patient declined counseling, and the policy does not explicitly require it for coverage."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Applicable CPT list in the policy maps exome sequence analysis to CPT code 81415."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Per the policy, WES is medically necessary when ordered by an approved provider and the clinical history suggests a genetic cause with qualifying features. The patient (15 yo) was referred by neurology, has a congenital anomaly and relevant family history, and had a nondiagnostic CMA — meeting the policy's coverage rationale for WES."
