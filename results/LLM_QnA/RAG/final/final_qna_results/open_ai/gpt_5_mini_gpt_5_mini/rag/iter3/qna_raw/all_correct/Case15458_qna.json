  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "BRCA1/2",
      "reasoning": "Patient is being evaluated specifically for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing (patient summary: 'being evaluated for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing')."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists 'Personal history of breast cancer and ... Diagnosed at age ≤45 years' as medically necessary indication. The patient is 19 with a personal history of breast cancer, meeting the age-based criterion."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires testing be performed in a setting with 'suitably trained health care providers' and recommends genetic counseling but does not specify required ordering provider type or specialty; the patient’s order by a nurse practitioner is not addressed explicitly in the policy."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy lists personal history of breast cancer diagnosed ≤45 and personal history with a close relative with ovarian or metastatic prostate cancer as indications. Patient has personal breast cancer and family history of ovarian cancer (maternal aunt) and metastatic prostate cancer in a close relative, meeting medical indication criteria."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Policy discusses prior limited testing in some contexts but does not require a specific prior test (and does not require FISH prior to BRCA testing); the patient's prior nondiagnostic FISH is not defined as a required precondition in the policy."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy defines 'close relatives' and lists family history (ovarian carcinoma; metastatic prostate cancer) as criteria. The patient has a maternal aunt with ovarian cancer (a close relative) and a close relative with metastatic prostate cancer, which are relevant family-history indications."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling and that testing occur in a setting with suitably trained providers. The patient completed pre-test genetic counseling with plans for post-test follow-up, meeting the counseling requirement described in the policy."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided policy document does not specify CPT or billing code mappings for BRCA1/BRCA2 testing, so a specific CPT code cannot be determined from the policy text."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Based on policy: patient has a personal history of breast cancer diagnosed ≤45 and relevant family history (ovarian carcinoma and metastatic prostate cancer), and received pre-test genetic counseling; these meet the policy's medical necessity and counseling requirements for BRCA1/2 germline testing."
