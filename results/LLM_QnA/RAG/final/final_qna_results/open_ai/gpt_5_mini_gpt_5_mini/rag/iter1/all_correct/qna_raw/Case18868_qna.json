  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered to assess for hereditary cancer predisposition."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy's GS coverage criteria explicitly require the member to be <21 years of age. The patient is 41 years old, so she does not meet the age-based eligibility criterion."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy requires an appropriate genetic and family history evaluation with a clinical letter detailing specific items (differential diagnoses, testing algorithm, previous tests/results, recommendation that GS is most appropriate, predicted impact on care). Although the patient was evaluated by a medical geneticist, there is no documentation provided of the required clinical letter or pre-test counseling, so ordering/provider requirements are not satisfied per the policy."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy defines specific medical indications (largely pediatric/neurodevelopmental/congenital anomaly presentations) for GS; adult hereditary cancer predisposition is not listed as an accepted indication. The patient's diagnosis (primary peritoneal carcinoma) does not meet the enumerated clinical indications."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy requires that the member not have prior exome/genome sequencing and requires documentation of prior tests and results in the clinical letter. While no prior exome/genome is reported (which would satisfy the 'not had previous ES/GS' requirement), the required clinical documentation and pre-test counseling were not provided, so prior test/documentation requirements are not complete per the policy."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy requires an evaluation of genetic and family history to be documented, but it does not define family history or consanguinity as a standalone eligibility criterion for adult GS in this context. The patient does have a family history concern (mother with hematologic disorder), but the policy does not specify that this family history alone makes the patient eligible."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy (and cited ACMG guidance within it) requires pre-test genetic counseling by a medical geneticist or affiliated genetic counselor with written documentation. The supplied patient materials state there was no documented pre-test genetic counseling, so counseling requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Policy procedure coding lists 81425 as the appropriate CPT code for genome sequencing (proband) when analyzing the entire genome; WGS should be billed with 81425 per the guideline."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Per the policy, all GS criteria must be met, including age <21 and required documentation/counseling. The patient is 41 and lacks documented required clinical documentation/pre-test counseling; therefore GS (WGS) is not covered under the provided criteria."
