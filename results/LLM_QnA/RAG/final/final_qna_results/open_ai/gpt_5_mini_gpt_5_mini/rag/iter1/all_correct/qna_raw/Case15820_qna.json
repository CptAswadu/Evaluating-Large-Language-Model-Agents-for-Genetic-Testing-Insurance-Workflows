  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "CMA",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states chromosomal microarray (CMA) has been ordered; policy is the CMA guideline (MOL.TS.150.A)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The CMA policy does not impose age-based eligibility limits for postnatal testing; it addresses indications (DD/ID) rather than specific age cutoffs, so age criteria are not specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy requires pre- and post-test genetic counseling and that the rendering laboratory be qualified, but it does not specify required ordering provider specialty or type for ordering CMA."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under 'Diagnostic Testing for Symptomatic Individuals' the policy lists developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID) as an approved indication. The patient is a living 31‑year‑old with DD/ID and no prior CMA, meeting the listed clinical criteria."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires 'No previous CMA testing' and that testing be performed on a living child or adult. Patient has no prior genetic testing reported and no prior CMA, so required prior-test conditions are satisfied."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "The policy specifies family history of chromosome rearrangement in phenotypically normal individuals as an exclusion; the patient’s family history (mother with early breast cancer) is not one of the family/consanguinity criteria that affect CMA eligibility per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires pre- and post-test genetic counseling. Patient completed multiple pre-test sessions with a genetic counselor and plans post-test follow-up, satisfying the counseling requirement."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81228",
      "reasoning": "The policy lists CPT 81228 (constitutional chromosomal microarray) as a CMA procedure code; the order is for CMA and 81228 is the applicable CMA code referenced."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Adjudication: patient meets policy criteria for postnatal diagnostic CMA (living adult with DD/ID, no prior CMA, counseling completed). CMA is reimbursable once per lifetime and no exclusions apply, so the test is covered per the policy."
