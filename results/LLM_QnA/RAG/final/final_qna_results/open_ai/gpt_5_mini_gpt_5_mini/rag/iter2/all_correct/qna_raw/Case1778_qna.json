  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "Patient information explicitly states whole exome sequencing (WES) has been requested."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires member be <21 years of age for ES; patient is 14, which meets the <21 years requirement (MOL.TS.235.C)."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The policy requires an appropriate genetic and family history evaluation and a clinical letter but does not specify a required ordering provider specialty/type for ES; no explicit ordering-provider credential requirement is stated."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires specific indications (e.g., global developmental delay, multiple congenital anomalies affecting different organ systems, or two-of-listed neurodevelopmental criteria). The patient has an isolated ocular coloboma (single organ system) and does not meet the listed indications for ES in the guideline."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Answerable",
      "reasoning": "Policy requires documentation of prior genetic/family history evaluation and previous tests; patient record notes only prior nondiagnostic FISH and does not document the required clinical letter or other prior tests (e.g., CMA or targeted testing) needed to assess compliance with prior-test requirements."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The general ES criteria do not set family history or consanguinity as a universal eligibility requirement for ES (except specific prenatal scenarios). No relevant family history/consanguinity is provided in the patient information."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Policy/ACMG guidance requires pretest counseling by a medical geneticist or genetic counselor and documentation; the patient information does not document that required genetic counseling or the clinical evaluation letter has occurred."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "Policy specifies CPT 81415 should be billed for proband exome sequencing (analyzing the entire exome)."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although age criterion is met, the patient does not meet the policy's defined medical indications for ES (isolated ocular coloboma does not satisfy multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental criteria), and required documentation of genetic evaluation/counseling and prior testing is not provided. Per the guideline, these unmet criteria make ES not medically necessary/covered."
