    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) is requested to investigate a possible genetic cause."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC policies do not impose a strict single age cutoff for WGS; coverage criteria are clinical (pediatric presentations are commonly considered) rather than age-limited in the documentation provided."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "There is no payer-specific requirement in typical UHC WES/WGS policy that the ordering clinician must be a genetics specialist; the referral from the child's neurologist meets usual ordering norms and no specialty restriction is specified."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES/WGS criteria generally require documented clinical indications such as unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability, multiple congenital anomalies, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, or a highly heterogeneous condition after appropriate prior testing. This patient has isolated significant childhood hearing/visual impairment (with a family history of epileptic encephalopathy) but does not clearly meet those specific listed indications as documented, and required prior targeted testing is not documented."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC guidance commonly requires prior appropriate testing (for example chromosomal microarray and disorder-specific/gene-panel testing for isolated hearing loss) before WES/WGS. Only Fragile X testing (nondiagnostic) is documented; CMA and appropriate targeted gene-panel testing for hearing/vision loss are not documented as completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "A sibling had early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (<3 years), which is a relevant family history that payers' criteria consider when assessing genetic testing necessity for a proband."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC and most payers require documented pre-test genetic counseling for WES/WGS or documentation why it was not possible. Counseling was offered but explicitly declined pre-test, so the requirement for documented pre-test counseling is not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "81425 corresponds to whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis and interpretation and is the CPT most appropriate for the requested test."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Under UHC WES/WGS coverage criteria the clinical indication and required prior testing (e.g., CMA and appropriate targeted panels) and documented pre-test genetic counseling are not met; therefore WGS is not covered as requested at this time."
