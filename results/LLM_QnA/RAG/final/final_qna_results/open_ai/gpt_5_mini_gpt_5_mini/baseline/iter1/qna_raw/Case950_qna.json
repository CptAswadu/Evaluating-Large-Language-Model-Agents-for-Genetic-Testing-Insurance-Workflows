    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "The case text explicitly states 'whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued to look for an underlying genetic cause.'"
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES coverage criteria are applied based on clinical presentation rather than strict age cutoffs; no payer-specific age exclusion is stated and the patient (38 y) with onset before age 3 meets clinical-age context but the policy does not set a numeric age requirement."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires an appropriate ordering clinician (e.g., geneticist or neurologist); the patient is being evaluated by a medical geneticist, which satisfies ordering-provider requirements."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC allows WES for unexplained early-onset epileptic encephalopathy or refractory/undiagnosed epileptic encephalopathies; the patient has unexplained epileptic encephalopathy with onset before age 3, meeting the medical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC commonly requires prior appropriate testing (e.g., chromosomal microarray and/or targeted epilepsy multigene panel) before WES; this patient has a nondiagnostic karyotype and has not had an epilepsy multigene panel or CMA, so required prior testing is incomplete."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Family history noted (uncle with prostate cancer) is not relevant to eligibility for WES for epileptic encephalopathy, and no consanguinity or relevant family neurologic history is reported."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC requires documentation of pre- and post-test genetic counseling for complex genomic testing; the patient has seen a genetic counselor multiple times and has plans for post-test counseling, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "CPT code 81415 corresponds to whole exome sequencing (clinical exome sequencing) and is the appropriate code for WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although clinical indication, provider, and counseling requirements are met, UHC coverage requires completion/documentation of required prior testing (e.g., CMA and/or epilepsy multigene panel) before approval of WES; those prior tests have not been completed, so WES is not covered at this time."
