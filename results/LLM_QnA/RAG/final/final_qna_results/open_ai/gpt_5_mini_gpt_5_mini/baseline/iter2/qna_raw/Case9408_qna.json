    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "The patient information explicitly states the patient is undergoing whole exome sequencing (WES) ordered by a medical geneticist for evaluation of epileptic encephalopathy."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "FEP WES coverage criteria do not impose a strict age cutoff for WES; eligibility is driven by clinical indication (early-onset epileptic encephalopathy) rather than a specific age limit, so age-based criteria are not specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "FEP requires an appropriate ordering clinician (e.g., medical geneticist or relevant specialist) for WES; the order was placed by a medical geneticist, satisfying provider requirements."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "FEP considers WES medically indicated for unexplained early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (onset <3 years) as a recognized indication; the patient has epileptic encephalopathy with onset before three years."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "FEP typically requires prior first‑tier testing such as chromosomal microarray before WES for neurodevelopmental/epileptic presentations; the patient had CMA previously performed and nondiagnostic, meeting prior test requirements."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "FEP WES coverage is driven by the proband's clinical presentation and prior testing rather than requiring specific family history or consanguinity; while a maternal hematologic/immunologic disorder is noted, family history criteria are not specified as a requirement."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "FEP policy requires documentation of pre‑test genetic counseling and plans for post‑test follow‑up for WES; the record states pre‑test counseling was completed and post‑test follow‑up with a genetic counselor is planned."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81415 corresponds to whole exome sequencing (sequence analysis and interpretation) and is the appropriate code for the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under FEP criteria the patient meets clinical indication (early-onset epileptic encephalopathy), prior required testing (nondiagnostic CMA) is documented, the order is from a medical geneticist, and genetic counseling was completed—therefore WES is covered."
