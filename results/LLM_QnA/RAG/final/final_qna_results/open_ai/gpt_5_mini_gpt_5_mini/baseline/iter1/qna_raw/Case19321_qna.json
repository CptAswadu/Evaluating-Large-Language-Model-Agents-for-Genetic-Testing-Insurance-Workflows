    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states 'whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued' to investigate a possible genetic etiology for a complex neurodevelopmental disorder."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC coverage for WES specifies pediatric eligibility for unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders; the patient is 1 year old, meeting the pediatric age-based criterion."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires ordering by a specialist or provider experienced in genetics (e.g., geneticist, neurologist); the test was referred/ordered by a neurologist, satisfying provider requirements."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC medical necessity criteria support WES for pediatric patients with complex neurodevelopmental disorder/autism features when a genetic etiology is suspected; the patient has these indications."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC generally requires prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) for unexplained developmental delay/ASD before WES; the record documents a nondiagnostic CMA was completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Family history relevant to genetic evaluation is considered supportive by UHC; a maternal aunt with multiple congenital anomalies is documented and is relevant to eligibility."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC requires pre-test genetic counseling for WES; the record states pre-test genetic counseling was completed and post-test follow-up is planned, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81415 corresponds to whole exome sequencing (proband-level) and best matches the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "All applicable UHC coverage criteria are met: pediatric age, appropriate clinical indication (complex NDD/ASD), prior nondiagnostic CMA, specialist ordering provider (neurologist), and pre-test genetic counseling — therefore WES is covered."
