  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "CMA",
      "reasoning": "The referral explicitly requests chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing to evaluate a genomic etiology for the patient's developmental disorder."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "BCBS FEP CMA coverage is based on clinical indication (unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability) and does not impose a strict age cutoff; the policy does not specify age-based exclusion for CMA."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "BCBS FEP CMA policy does not mandate a specific ordering provider specialty in the documentation provided; no specialty requirement is indicated in the patient information."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Patient has lifelong severe intellectual disability (diagnosed by age 18) consistent with unexplained intellectual disability/developmental disorder—an indicated clinical reason for CMA per BCBS FEP medical policy."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "BCBS FEP considers CMA a first‑tier test for unexplained ID/DD and does not require completion of other specific genetic tests beforehand; the patient has no prior testing but none is mandated."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "BCBS FEP CMA coverage is driven by the proband's clinical presentation (ID/DD); family history/consanguinity criteria are not specified for CMA eligibility here (mother's ovarian cancer is not relevant)."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "When required/expected by payer policy, documentation of pre‑test genetic counseling is requested; the patient completed pre‑test counseling with a genetic counselor and post‑test follow‑up plans were discussed, meeting counseling expectations."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81228",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81228 corresponds to chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), which is the test requested."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Patient meets clinical indication for CMA (unexplained severe intellectual disability), counseling was completed, no disqualifying age or prior‑test requirements apply under BCBS FEP policy; therefore CMA is covered."
