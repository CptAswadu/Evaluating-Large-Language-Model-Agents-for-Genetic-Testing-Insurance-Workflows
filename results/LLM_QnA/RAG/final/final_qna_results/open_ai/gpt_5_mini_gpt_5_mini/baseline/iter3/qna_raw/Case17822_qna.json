  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The patient information explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered as the next‑tier diagnostic test."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC genomic testing policies do not impose a strict age cutoff for WGS/WES; the record shows a 13‑year‑old but no age‑based exclusion or special age criterion is specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC policies for WGS/WES require ordering by an appropriate genetics provider or specialist; the order was placed by a medical geneticist, which meets that provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC coverage criteria support WGS for patients with multiple congenital anomalies/multisystem involvement and suspected genetic etiology; the patient has multiple congenital anomalies affecting different organ systems, meeting the medical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires prior tiered testing (e.g., nondiagnostic chromosomal microarray) before WGS; the record states a nondiagnostic CMA was performed prior to ordering WGS."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "While a family history of a sibling with short stature is documented, UHC WGS eligibility does not generally require specific family history or consanguinity criteria, so family history is not a specified eligibility requirement here."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC policy requires documentation of pre‑test genetic counseling for comprehensive genomic testing; the patient declined genetic counseling prior to testing, so the counseling requirement was not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81425 corresponds to whole genome sequencing (germline, comprehensive), which best matches the ordered WGS."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although age, provider, clinical indication, and prior nondiagnostic CMA meet UHC criteria, pre‑test genetic counseling is a coverage requirement and was declined (no documentation of completed counseling), so coverage would not be approved under UHC policy."
