  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The patient information explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) is being ordered."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC WGS/WES criteria are generally directed to pediatric patients with suspected genetic disorders; the patient is 5 years old (pediatric) and therefore meets age-based eligibility for pediatric genomic sequencing."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC requires ordering/oversight by an appropriate genetics provider (medical geneticist, geneticist, or equivalent). The test was ordered following evaluation by a medical geneticist, satisfying provider requirements."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC policy supports WGS/WES for pediatric patients with structural congenital anomalies or suspicion of a syndromic genetic etiology; the patient has congenital choanal atresia with concern for an underlying syndromic association, which meets a medical indication in policy."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires prior standard cytogenomic testing (chromosomal microarray) or other recommended first‑line tests before WGS/WES. The record states only a prior karyotype (nondiagnostic) and does not document CMA or other required prior testing, so required prior tests are incomplete."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Family history is relevant under UHC criteria; the patient has an older sibling with developmental delay, which is pertinent family history supporting evaluation for a heritable syndrome."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC requires documentation of pre‑test genetic counseling for genomic sequencing. The record documents pre‑test counseling completed on multiple occasions and planned post‑test follow‑up, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "The best corresponding CPT among the options for whole genome sequencing is 81425 (genomic sequencing, whole genome analysis and interpretation)."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although age, provider, medical indication (syndrome suspicion), counseling, and family history support WGS, UHC requires completion/documentation of required prior testing (e.g., chromosomal microarray) before approving WGS. Because CMA is not documented as completed, the request does not meet UHC prior‑test requirements and is not covered as submitted."
