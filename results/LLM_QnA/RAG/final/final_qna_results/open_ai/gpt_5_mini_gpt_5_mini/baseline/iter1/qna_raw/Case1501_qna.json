  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "The case text explicitly states that Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is being ordered."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES coverage criteria do not impose a strict age cutoff for WES; pediatric patients are routinely eligible, and no age-based exclusion is stated for this indication."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC policies typically require that testing be ordered with appropriate documentation and genetic counseling but do not strictly limit ordering to a single specialty in the policy text; the patient was referred by a developmental pediatrician and had pre-test counseling, which meets usual provider/counseling expectations."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC covers WES for individuals with unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability and/or multiple congenital anomalies when a monogenic etiology is suspected; this 2‑year‑old has multiple congenital anomalies and ongoing developmental concerns, satisfying those clinical indications."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES policy requires prior appropriate testing (e.g., chromosomal microarray) to be nondiagnostic before WES for developmental delay/congenital anomalies. Only a nondiagnostic karyotype is documented; no CMA result is provided, so the required prior test has not been completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The patient has a relevant family history (mother with Long QT syndrome). Family history of a genetic disorder is present and can be relevant to genetic testing decisions per coverage considerations."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC requires pre-test genetic counseling for targeted and comprehensive genomic testing; the record states pre-test genetic counseling was completed and post-test follow-up is planned, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81415 corresponds to exome sequencing (proband-only), which best matches the ordered WES in this scenario."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although clinical indications and counseling requirements are met, UHC policy requires prior appropriate testing (typically chromosomal microarray) to be nondiagnostic before WES for developmental delay/multiple congenital anomalies; CMA was not documented, so coverage criteria are not fully met."
