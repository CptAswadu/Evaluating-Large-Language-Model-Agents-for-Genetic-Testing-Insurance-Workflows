  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered as the next‑tier diagnostic test."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES/WGS coverage criteria are driven by clinical indication rather than strict age cutoffs; no payer age restriction is specified and a 13‑year‑old is a typical pediatric candidate."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC requires ordering by an appropriate genetics provider or clinician experienced in genetics for WES/WGS; the order was placed by a medical geneticist, which meets that requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC covers WES/WGS for individuals with multiple congenital anomalies or complex multisystem presentations after nondiagnostic CMA; the patient has multisystem congenital anomalies and meets that clinical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC generally requires prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) to be nondiagnostic before WGS; the record states a nondiagnostic CMA was performed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Although a sibling with short stature is reported, UHC WGS criteria do not generally require positive family history/consanguinity as a prerequisite for coverage in this clinical scenario, so family history is not a specified gating criterion here."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires documented pre‑test genetic counseling/consent for clinical WES/WGS. The family declined counseling prior to testing, so the counseling requirement is not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Among the provided CPT options, 81425 corresponds to whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis and reporting."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the patient meets clinical indication, age is appropriate, a nondiagnostic CMA was completed, and the order was placed by a medical geneticist, documented pre‑test genetic counseling (a UHC coverage requirement) was declined. Failure to meet the counseling requirement means the test would not meet all UHC coverage conditions."
