    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) is requested to assess for an underlying genetic cause."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UnitedHealthcare WES/WGS coverage is driven by clinical indications rather than a strict age cutoff in typical policy language; no explicit age-based exclusion or minimum is stated for WGS in this clinical context."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC policies typically require an appropriate ordering clinician but do not universally restrict orders to a single specialty; the patient was referred by neurology (an appropriate specialist), but the payer policy does not explicitly mandate a single named specialty in the provided information."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The infant has early-onset recurrent seizure-like events/BRUE with concern for genetic etiology and prior nondiagnostic CMA — this meets UHC criteria for WES/WGS for unexplained early-onset epilepsy/neurodevelopmental disorder."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC generally requires prior chromosomal microarray evaluation before WES/WGS when applicable; the record states CMA was performed and nondiagnostic, satisfying that prior-test requirement. (No documentation of a prior epilepsy gene panel is provided.)"
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Family history provided only includes maternal short stature (a growth finding) which is not a clearly relevant family history of seizures or a specified consanguinity criterion in UHC coverage rules."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires documentation of pre-test genetic counseling or informed consent; the family declined pre-test genetic counseling, so the counseling requirement is not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81425 corresponds to whole genome sequencing (interpretation and report), which matches the requested WGS."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although clinical indications for WGS are met and prior CMA is nondiagnostic, the payer routinely requires documented pre-test genetic counseling/informed consent. The family declined pre-test counseling, so coverage would not meet UHC documentation requirements and would be denied."
