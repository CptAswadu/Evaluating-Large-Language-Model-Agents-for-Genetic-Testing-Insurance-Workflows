    "Q0": {
      "answer": "CMA",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states a chromosomal microarray (CMA) was ordered to assess for genomic copy number changes in the child with severe intellectual disability."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "BCBS FEP CMA coverage criteria use clinical indication (unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability) rather than a strict age cutoff; no age-based exclusion is specified and a 2-year-old fits typical pediatric indications."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "FEP policies generally require an appropriate treating or ordering clinician but do not strictly limit CMA orders to a specific specialty; the record shows an MD specialist (oncologist) ordered the test, and payer policy does not explicitly restrict ordering provider type for CMA."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Medical necessity criteria for BCBS FEP cover CMA as first‑line testing for unexplained intellectual disability/developmental delay; the patient is a 2‑year‑old with severe intellectual disability, meeting that indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "BCBS FEP treats CMA as a recommended first‑tier test for unexplained ID/DD, so no specific prior genetic testing (e.g., karyotype) is universally required prior to CMA; the record also indicates no prior genetic testing."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Payer CMA criteria do not require a positive family history or consanguinity; although a maternal aunt has an immunologic disorder, that family history is not a specified required criterion for CMA coverage."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "BCBS FEP expects genetic counseling for high‑complexity genomic testing. The family completed pre‑test genetic counseling and plans post‑test counseling, satisfying counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81228",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81228 corresponds to chromosomal microarray (constitutional microarray) testing for copy number analysis and is the appropriate code for the ordered CMA."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Under BCBS FEP criteria, CMA is covered for individuals with unexplained intellectual disability/developmental delay. The 2‑year‑old has severe intellectual disability, no prior testing is required, pre‑test counseling is completed, and the order is from an appropriate treating clinician, so coverage is supported."
