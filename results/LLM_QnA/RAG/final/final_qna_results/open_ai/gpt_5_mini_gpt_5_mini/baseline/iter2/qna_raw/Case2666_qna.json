  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "BRCA1/2",
      "reasoning": "The patient is explicitly undergoing BRCA1/2 testing per the clinical information (ordered by her obstetrician)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "BCBS FEP BRCA policies apply to adults; the patient is 21 years old and thus meets age-based eligibility (adult) for germline BRCA testing."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The provided payer-level requirements do not strictly require a particular ordering specialty; although genetic counseling was completed (which supports appropriateness), the policy does not mandate a specific provider specialty for ordering."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Medical indication criteria for BRCA testing include a first‑degree relative with metastatic prostate cancer (strong family history). The patient’s father has metastatic prostate cancer, satisfying a covered family-history indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "There are no required prior diagnostic genetic tests for germline BRCA testing in this context; the prior nondiagnostic FISH is irrelevant to BRCA germline testing and the policy does not mandate other prior tests."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Family-history criteria are specified for BRCA testing and the patient has a relevant family history (father with metastatic prostate cancer, a first‑degree relative)."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "BCBS FEP BRCA testing generally expects documented pre-test genetic counseling; the record states pre-test counseling was completed with a genetic specialist and post-test follow-up is planned, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "None of the provided CPT options clearly correspond to standard BRCA1/2 germline testing CPT codes (BRCA1/2 are typically reported with 81211–81217 or gene-specific codes not listed), so a best-match code is not available among the choices."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Based on FEP BRCA coverage criteria the patient is an adult with a first-degree relative with metastatic prostate cancer and has documented pre-test genetic counseling; these elements meet policy criteria for coverage of germline BRCA1/2 testing."
