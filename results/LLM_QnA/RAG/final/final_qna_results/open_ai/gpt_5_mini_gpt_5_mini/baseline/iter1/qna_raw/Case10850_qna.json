    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WGS/WES coverage criteria do not impose a strict age cutoff for pediatric testing; the patient is 13 but the policy does not specify an age restriction relevant to eligibility."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC policy does not explicitly restrict ordering to a narrow provider type in this scenario; the test is ordered by a developmental pediatrician and pre-test genetic counseling is documented, with no payer-specific ordering-provider disqualification noted in the record."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC criteria define coverage for WGS/WES for unexplained global developmental delay/intellectual disability only after standard first‑tier testing (eg, chromosomal microarray and other indicated targeted tests) are nondiagnostic; the patient has global developmental delay but has only had nondiagnostic FISH (not CMA), so specific medical indication requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC requires prior diagnostic testing such as chromosomal microarray (and other appropriate targeted tests) before WGS; the record shows only nondiagnostic FISH and does not document completion of CMA or other required prior tests."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The patient has a relevant family history (an aunt with dysmorphic features); UHC guidance considers family history of similar phenotypes relevant to genetic evaluation."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC policies require pre‑test genetic counseling for complex genomic testing; the family completed pre‑test counseling and plans for post‑test follow-up, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "CPT code 81425 corresponds to clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS), which matches the ordered test."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the clinical presentation (global developmental delay), positive family history, and documented pre‑test counseling support evaluation, UHC coverage requires completion of first‑tier testing (eg, chromosomal microarray) prior to WGS; because required prior testing has not been completed, WGS is not covered per policy."
