  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "The case text explicitly states that whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued to investigate an underlying genetic etiology."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES coverage criteria do not impose a strict age cutoff; the patient is 17 but the payer policy applies across pediatric/adult presentations, so no age-based exclusion or specific age requirement is specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires that testing be ordered/coordinated by an appropriate genetics provider; here a medical geneticist is coordinating the testing, which satisfies ordering/provider requirements in the payer policy."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES criteria include unexplained global developmental delay/intellectual disability and similar neurodevelopmental disorders as accepted indications. The patient has lifelong GDD with cognitive and adaptive deficits, meeting the medical indication criteria."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC generally requires prior first‑tier testing (chromosomal microarray as first‑line for unexplained GDD/ID). Only nondiagnostic FISH is documented; no chromosomal microarray (CMA) or other required prior testing is documented, so required prior tests appear incomplete."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Family history is relevant to eligibility under UHC criteria; the patient has a sibling with early‑onset epileptic encephalopathy (onset before age 3), which is pertinent family history supporting genetic evaluation."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC requires documentation of pre‑test genetic counseling and appropriate post‑test plans for WES. The patient had pre‑test counseling with a genetic counselor and will return for post‑test counseling, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "The CPT code corresponding to proband whole exome sequencing (WES) is 81415, which best matches the requested test."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the indication, provider, and counseling meet UHC criteria, required prior testing (notably chromosomal microarray as first‑tier testing for unexplained GDD/ID) is not documented. Per UHC coverage rules, lack of documented required prior testing means WES is not covered at this time."
