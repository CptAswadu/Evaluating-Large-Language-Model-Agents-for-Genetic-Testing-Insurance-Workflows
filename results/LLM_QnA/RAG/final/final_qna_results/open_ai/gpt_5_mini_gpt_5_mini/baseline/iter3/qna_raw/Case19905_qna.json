    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states the patient is being considered for whole exome sequencing (WES)."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES coverage criteria are focused on pediatric patients with unexplained developmental delay/multiple congenital anomalies; the patient is 3 years old, which satisfies pediatric age-based eligibility."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC generally requires an appropriate specialist to order WES (genetics, pediatric subspecialist). The test was referred by a developmental pediatrician, which meets ordering-provider requirements."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC medical necessity criteria support WES for patients with multiple congenital anomalies and developmental concerns; the patient has multiple congenital anomalies and developmental referral, meeting indication criteria."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) (and other targeted testing as appropriate) before WES. Only a nondiagnostic karyotype is documented; there is no documentation of prior CMA, so required prior testing has not been completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES criteria do not generally require a specific family history or consanguinity to qualify; although a maternal history of long QT is documented, family-history-based criteria for WES eligibility are not specified in this case."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC coverage and best-practice requirements expect documentation of genetic counseling (pre-/post-test) for WES. The record states no genetic counseling has been conducted, so counseling requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81415 corresponds to clinical exome sequencing (WES) interpretation/reporting and is the appropriate code for WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although age, provider, and clinical indication meet UHC criteria, required prerequisites (documentation of prior CMA or other required prior testing and documented genetic counseling) are missing; therefore under UHC criteria the test is not covered at this time."
