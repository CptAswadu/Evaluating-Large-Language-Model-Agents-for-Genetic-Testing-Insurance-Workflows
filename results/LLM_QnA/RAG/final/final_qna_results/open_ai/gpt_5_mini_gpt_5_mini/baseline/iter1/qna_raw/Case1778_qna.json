  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states whole exome sequencing (WES) has been requested for diagnostic clarification of an ocular coloboma."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Typical payer WES policies do not impose strict age cutoffs; the patient is 14 but no payer-specific age restriction is provided in the information, so age-based eligibility is not specified here."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "Most policies allow ordering by an appropriate licensed provider but specific specialty requirements (e.g., genetics specialist) are not provided in the case details, so ordering-provider requirements are not specified."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Most payer WES criteria require multiple congenital anomalies, moderate–severe developmental delay/intellectual disability, or a strong suspicion of a Mendelian disorder; this patient has an isolated ocular coloboma without additional anomalies, developmental delay, or documented syndromic features, so he does not meet defined medical-indication criteria."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Common coverage rules require prior appropriate cytogenomic testing (usually chromosomal microarray) or targeted testing before WES. Only FISH was done and was nondiagnostic; CMA was not documented, so required prior testing is not complete."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Family history or consanguinity relevant to WES eligibility is not reported in the provided information; therefore the patient does not have a documented family-history criterion supporting WES."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Payer policies commonly require documented pre-test genetic counseling for WES; no genetic counseling information is provided, so counseling requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81415 corresponds to whole exome sequencing (clinical exome sequencing with interpretation), which matches the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Based on payer-style criteria applied here: the patient has an isolated ocular coloboma (not meeting typical WES medical-indication thresholds), required prior testing (CMA) is not documented, and genetic counseling is not documented; therefore the request does not meet coverage criteria."
