  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered to evaluate an underlying genetic etiology."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WGS/WES coverage criteria are applied to clinical indication rather than limiting by neonate vs older child in this scenario; no specific age cutoff is provided in the patient documentation."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC generally requires an appropriate ordering clinician, but the payer policy does not strictly restrict ordering to a geneticist in all cases. The record shows a neurologist ordered testing; the policy does not explicitly prohibit this, so ordering-provider specificity is not clearly specified in the documentation."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC coverage criteria support WGS/WES for individuals with multiple congenital anomalies or multisystem involvement when genetic etiology is suspected; the neonate has multiple congenital anomalies affecting several organ systems, meeting the clinical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC policy typically requires prior first‑tier cytogenetic testing such as chromosomal microarray (CMA) before WGS/WES for multiple congenital anomalies. Only FISH was done (nondiagnostic); CMA was not documented, so required prior testing is incomplete."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "The patient has an affected older sibling with multiple congenital anomalies; family history is documented and is relevant under UHC criteria as supporting the genetic evaluation."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC normally requires documentation that pre‑test genetic counseling was offered/occurred for complex genomic testing. The family explicitly declined genetic counseling, so counseling requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "The test ordered is whole genome sequencing; CPT 81415 corresponds to whole genome sequence analysis in standard CPT mappings used for payer adjudication."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although clinical indication (multiple congenital anomalies, positive family history) supports WGS, coverage requirements (documentation of prior appropriate testing — CMA — and completed pre‑test genetic counseling) are not met per UHC criteria; therefore the test is not covered as submitted."
