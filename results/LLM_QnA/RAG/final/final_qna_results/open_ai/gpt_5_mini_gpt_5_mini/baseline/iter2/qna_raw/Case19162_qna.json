    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states the medical geneticist referred the neonate for whole genome sequencing (WGS) to evaluate an underlying genetic/metabolic cause."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP policies that address genome/exome testing define pediatric/neonatal patients as eligible when presenting with suspected genetic disorders; the patient is a neonate and therefore meets age-based eligibility."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP typically requires a specialist/genetics provider order for WGS; the request was made by a medical geneticist, satisfying the ordering-provider requirement."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Policy coverage criteria include infants with complex, unexplained neurologic abnormalities and suspected genetic/metabolic disease; this neonate has dystonia, ataxia, asymmetric weakness and a sibling with an IEM, meeting clinical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP commonly requires prior first‑tier testing (e.g., chromosomal microarray) to be nondiagnostic before routine WGS except in critical-illness exceptions. The record documents nondiagnostic Fragile X but does not document prior CMA or other required prior testing, so required prior tests are not completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "There is a documented family history of an inborn error of metabolism in a sibling, which is relevant to eligibility under BCBS_FEP family-history criteria for genetic evaluation."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP requires pre‑test counseling for advanced genomic testing; pre-test counseling was completed with a genetic counselor and post-test follow-up is planned, meeting counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Among the provided CPT options, 81425 corresponds to whole genome sequencing analysis/interpretation and is the best match for WGS."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although age, ordering provider, clinical indication, family history, and counseling requirements are met, BCBS_FEP routine coverage generally requires prior first‑tier testing (e.g., chromosomal microarray) to be nondiagnostic before authorizing WGS. No documentation of prior CMA is provided, so coverage would not be approved under standard criteria (unless an exception for a critically ill infant is documented)."
