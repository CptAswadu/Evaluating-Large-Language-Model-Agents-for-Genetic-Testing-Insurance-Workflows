    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "The note explicitly states whole exome sequencing (WES) has been requested to investigate a genetic etiology for autism spectrum disorder."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UnitedHealthcare WES coverage is driven by clinical indication (developmental/neurologic disorders) rather than strict age cutoffs; no age-based exclusion applies to this 12-year-old in applicable policy."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC policies focus on clinical indications and testing pathway; they do not universally restrict ordering to a single specialty in the provided criteria, and the record shows referral by a developmental pediatrician (an appropriate specialist), but specific ordering-provider requirements are not specified in the available policy context."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC permits WES for unexplained autism spectrum disorder when there is an additional abnormality/other organ system involvement or neurodevelopmental disorder; the patient has ASD plus at least one additional abnormality, meeting the medical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC generally requires prior appropriate testing (typically chromosomal microarray and other targeted testing such as fragile X as clinically indicated) before WES; only karyotype was performed and was nondiagnostic, and no CMA or other required prior testing is documented."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "While family history (paternal uncle with dystonia/ataxia) is documented and may be supportive, UHC WES criteria do not make family history/consanguinity a required eligibility criterion in this context."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC expects documentation of pre-test genetic counseling/informed consent for WES; no pre-test genetic counseling is documented in the record, so counseling requirement is not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81415 corresponds to clinical whole exome sequencing (proband or single exome analysis), which matches the requested WES."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the clinical indication is met (ASD with additional abnormality), coverage prerequisites per UHC (documentation of prior CMA/other required genetic testing and documented pre-test genetic counseling) are not satisfied; therefore the test would not be approved as submitted."
