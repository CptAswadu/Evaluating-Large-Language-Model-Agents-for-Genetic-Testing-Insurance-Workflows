  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "BRCA1/2",
      "reasoning": "The patient was referred specifically for BRCA1/2 testing per the clinical information."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP hereditary breast/ovarian cancer testing has no exclusionary upper/lower age limit for adult testing; the patient is 18 years (adult) and therefore meets age-related eligibility."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP allows ordering by an appropriate licensed clinician (e.g., oncologist). The patient is being evaluated by an oncologist who referred for testing, satisfying ordering-provider requirements."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP coverage for BRCA1/2 requires relevant personal or family history of BRCA-associated cancers or a known familial pathogenic variant. This patient has no personal history of BRCA-related cancer and the family history (maternal uncle with dystonia and ataxia) is not a BRCA-related cancer history, so medical indication is not met."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP does not mandate specific prior genetic tests (e.g., karyotype) before BRCA1/2 testing except when a known familial variant exists; the provided info about a prior nondiagnostic karyotype is not a standard prerequisite and no specific prior-test requirement is documented."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP requires family history of BRCA-related cancers (breast/ovarian/etc.) or a known familial pathogenic variant. The family history here (maternal uncle with dystonia and ataxia) is not relevant to BRCA eligibility and no consanguinity is reported."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "BCBS_FEP generally requires documented pre-test genetic counseling for hereditary cancer testing. The patient has not had pretest genetic counseling, so counseling requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "The clinical data specify BRCA1/2 testing but do not specify the exact methodology or CPT to be billed (single-gene sequencing, large panel, deletion/duplication), and multiple CPT codes may apply; therefore a single CPT cannot be determined from the provided information."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Applying BCBS_FEP coverage criteria: although age and ordering provider are acceptable, the patient lacks the required medical indication (no BRCA-related personal or family cancer history) and pre-test genetic counseling is not documented. Therefore the BRCA1/2 test is not covered in this case."
