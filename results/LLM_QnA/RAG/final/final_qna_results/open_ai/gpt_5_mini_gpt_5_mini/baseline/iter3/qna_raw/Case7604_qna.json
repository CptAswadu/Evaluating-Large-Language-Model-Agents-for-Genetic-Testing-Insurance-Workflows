  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states 'whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered' for the neonate."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WGS/WES policy is applied by clinical indication rather than a strict patient-age cutoff in typical published criteria; no explicit age exclusion or specific neonatal-only age requirement is stated in the provided policy context, so age-based criteria are not specified for this request."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC policies generally do not mandate a single named ordering specialty in all cases (orders may come from treating physicians/geneticists), and the provided patient data only lists a referring neurologist — the policy does not explicitly require a specific ordering provider type in this scenario."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC criteria support WGS/WES when there is suspected genetic etiology for multiple congenital anomalies and prior targeted testing was nondiagnostic. The neonate has multiple congenital anomalies across organ systems and nondiagnostic FISH, which meets a defined clinical indication for broader genomic testing."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC commonly requires prior first‑line testing such as chromosomal microarray (CMA) for multiple congenital anomalies prior to WES/WGS unless emergent/critically ill NICU indication applies. The record documents FISH (nondiagnostic) but does not document prior CMA, so required prior testing has not been completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC coverage criteria consider positive family history of similar findings as relevant support. An older sibling with multiple congenital anomalies is documented and is relevant to eligibility."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires documentation of pre-test genetic counseling (or counseling by qualified provider) for complex genomic testing. The family explicitly declined genetic counseling, so counseling requirements are not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81425 corresponds to whole genome sequencing (WGS) with analysis and interpretation and is the appropriate code for the ordered test."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although the neonate meets clinical indication (multiple congenital anomalies, nondiagnostic targeted testing, positive family history), coverage prerequisites are not met per UHC criteria: chromosomal microarray (or other required prior testing) is not documented and required pre‑test genetic counseling was declined. Based on payer criteria, these unmet prerequisites lead to noncoverage."
