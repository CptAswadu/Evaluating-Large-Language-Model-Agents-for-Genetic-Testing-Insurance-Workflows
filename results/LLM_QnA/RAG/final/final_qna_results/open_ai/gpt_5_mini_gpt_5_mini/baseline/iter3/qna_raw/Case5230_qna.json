    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WES",
      "reasoning": "The patient was referred for whole exome sequencing (WES) explicitly."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES coverage criteria do not set a strict age cutoff in most published guidance; the patient is a 15‑year‑old adolescent which would fall within typical pediatric eligibility but no explicit age restriction is specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC policies for WES focus on clinical indications and prior testing rather than requiring a specific ordering provider specialty in most cases; no specialist restriction is documented in the provided patient information."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC covers WES for individuals with unexplained congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders after standard testing is nondiagnostic; this patient has a congenital anomaly and meets that clinical indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing to be nondiagnostic before WES; the record states a nondiagnostic CMA was performed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Family history can be relevant to WES eligibility; the patient has a sibling with an inborn error of metabolism, which is clinically relevant and supports testing per UHC criteria."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC WES guidance requires documentation of pre‑test genetic counseling/informed consent; the patient declined genetic counseling, so the counseling requirement is not met."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81415",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81415 corresponds to clinical exome sequencing (WES) interpretation/reporting and is the appropriate code for a proband WES request."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although clinical indication and prior testing (nondiagnostic CMA) are met and family history is supportive, UHC requires documentation of pre‑test genetic counseling/informed consent for WES; counseling was declined and therefore the counseling requirement is not met, resulting in noncoverage per payer criteria."
