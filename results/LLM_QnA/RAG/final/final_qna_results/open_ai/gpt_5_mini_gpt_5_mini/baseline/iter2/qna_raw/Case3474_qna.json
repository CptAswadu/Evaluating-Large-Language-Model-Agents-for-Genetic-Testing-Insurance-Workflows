    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The clinical note explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) is being ordered to assess an underlying genetic etiology."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC WGS/WES policies do not impose a strict age cut-off for testing in pediatric patients with congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental concerns; the patient is a 5-year-old and age-based exclusion is not specified."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC requires that testing be ordered/managed by an appropriate genetics provider; the order is from a medical geneticist, which satisfies provider requirements in the policy."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC coverage criteria include patients with congenital structural anomalies and suspected syndromic/genetic disorder; the patient has congenital choanal atresia and a sibling with developmental delay, meeting medical indication for diagnostic WGS."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) or equivalent cytogenomic testing before WES/WGS unless clinically inappropriate; only a nondiagnostic karyotype is documented and no CMA was completed, so required prior testing is not satisfied."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Family history criteria are relevant for WGS and the patient has a first-degree sibling with developmental delay, which is a relevant positive family history per the policy."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC policies require documented pre-test genetic counseling for WES/WGS; the record states pre-test counseling was completed multiple times with planned post-test follow-up, satisfying counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "CPT 81425 corresponds to whole genome sequencing (genomic sequence analysis—WGS), which matches the requested test."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although medical indication, provider type, counseling, and family history support WGS, UHC requires prior appropriate cytogenomic testing (typically chromosomal microarray) before authorizing WGS. CMA was not completed (only a nondiagnostic karyotype), therefore coverage criteria are not met and WGS would be denied pending required prior testing."
