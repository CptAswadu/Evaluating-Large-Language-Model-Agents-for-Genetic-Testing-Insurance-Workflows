  "qna_result": {
    "Q0": {
      "answer": "WGS",
      "reasoning": "The patient information explicitly states whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been ordered."
    },
    "Q1": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC sequencing criteria apply to pediatric patients with unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability; the patient is age 2 and therefore meets age-based (pediatric) eligibility."
    },
    "Q2": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "Payer criteria generally require ordering/oversight by a genetics professional for genome sequencing; the test was ordered while the patient is being evaluated by a medical geneticist and pre-test counseling was completed by a genetic counselor, meeting provider requirements."
    },
    "Q3": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC covers genomic sequencing for unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability without a specific syndrome suspected; the patient has developmental delay/ID meeting that indication."
    },
    "Q4": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "UHC typically requires prior first‑tier testing such as chromosomal microarray for unexplained developmental delay/ID; only Fragile X testing is reported (nondiagnostic) and CMA is not documented as completed."
    },
    "Q5": {
      "answer": "Not Specified",
      "reasoning": "UHC sequencing criteria do not generally require a family history or consanguinity for coverage of WGS in DD/ID; while a paternal Long QT history is present, it is not specified as relevant to this WGS indication."
    },
    "Q6": {
      "answer": "Yes",
      "reasoning": "UHC expects documented pre‑test genetic counseling for genomic sequencing; pre-test counseling was completed with a genetic counselor and plans exist for post‑test counseling, satisfying counseling requirements."
    },
    "Q7": {
      "answer": "81425",
      "reasoning": "Among the provided CPT options, 81425 corresponds to whole genome sequencing (clinical genome sequencing) and best matches the ordered WGS."
    },
    "Q8": {
      "answer": "No",
      "reasoning": "Although age, provider, indication, and counseling requirements are met, required prior testing (chromosomal microarray) is not documented; per UHC coverage rules WGS would not be approved until prior/CMA testing requirements are satisfied (or an exception documented)."
