Case15202,rag,iter2,Q5,"Within the provided policy text, the American Society of Breast Surgeons guidance (included in the document) states BRCA1/2 testing should be available to individuals with a personal history of breast cancer. The benefit application portion states benefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when medically necessary. The patient has a personal history of malignant breast tumor and has completed pre-test counseling; therefore, based on the policy text and patient facts, BRCA1/2 testing would be covered."
Case12834,rag,iter2,Q5,"Per the guideline and cited professional recommendations within the document (ACMG/AAP/AACAP), chromosomal microarray is a recommended/first-tier test for individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders/ID/GDD. The patient is a 16-year-old with complex neurodevelopmental disorder and prior Fragile X testing nondiagnostic, meeting the coverage-related clinical indication for CMA."
Case16487,rag,iter2,Q5,"Per the policy, WES (or rapid WES) may be considered medically necessary for infants/children with high-risk BRUE when criteria are met. Patient is an infant with recurrent high-risk BRUE (policy-listed clinical feature), prior genetic testing was nondiagnostic (FISH), pre-test counseling was completed, and there is potential to change management—together supporting that WES is covered per the policy."
Case19321,rag,iter2,Q2,"Per policy, WES may be medically necessary for children with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders when: (1) evaluation by a genetics-expert with family history/phenotype description and counseling is documented, (2) there is potential to change management, and (3) prior testing (eg, CMA) failed to yield a diagnosis. Patient has an unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder, prior CMA was nondiagnostic (criterion 3), family history and phenotype documented, and pre-test genetic counseling completed (criterion 1). The clinical team is pursuing WES (implying potential to change management). Therefore, the facts provided satisfy the policy requirements for coverage."
Case16246,rag,iter2,Q6,"On adjudication of coverage criteria in the policy, the patient meets medical-necessity criteria for BRCA1/2 testing (personal history of breast cancer diagnosed ≤45 years and relevant family history). The policy also requires testing be done in a setting that can provide pre/post-test counseling; lack of documented pre-test counseling should be addressed operationally but does not negate that the patient meets coverage criteria."
Case15202,rag,iter3,Q5,"Based on the policy citations (American Society of Breast Surgeons guidance noted in the document) that genetic testing should be made available to individuals with a personal history of breast cancer, and given the patient has a personal history of a malignant breast tumor and has completed pre-test genetic counseling, BRCA1/2 testing would be considered covered as medically necessary per the policy's cited guidance and the Benefit Application clause that genetic testing is covered when medically necessary."
Case8621,rag,iter3,Q2,"Under the policy, standard WES may be medically necessary for children with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders when ALL criteria are met. The patient: is a child with an unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder (meets indication), had prior CMA nondiagnostic (meets prior-testing criterion), and has completed pre-test genetic counseling. Although the ordering provider is an oncologist (Q2), documentation shows evaluation/counseling by a genetic counselor meeting the policy's counseling/expertise requirement. The family seeks a unifying diagnosis (implying potential to change management). Therefore the case meets the policy's criteria for coverage."
Case950,rag,iter3,Q5,"Per the policy the patient has unexplained early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (onset <3 years), no known underlying cause, and has not had prior epilepsy panel testing — criteria supported by the guideline for genetic NGS-based testing (and the guideline references ES/GS as appropriate). Therefore WES is covered."
Case19255,rag,iter3,Q6,"Patient meets policy criteria for BRCA full sequence testing: age ≥18, documented pre-test genetic counseling, no prior BRCA full sequencing, medical indication of two separate primary breast cancers, and relevant family history (father with metastatic prostate cancer). Therefore testing is covered per the BRCA Analysis criteria."
Case5605,rag,iter3,Q5,"Based on policy, standard WGS is medically necessary for pediatric patients <21 with unexplained congenital anomalies when evaluated by a genetics expert, prior genetic testing is nondiagnostic, and there is potential to change management. Patient is 11, had nondiagnostic CMA, received genetics counseling, and meets the policy criteria; therefore WGS is covered."
Case6478,rag,iter3,Q6,"Based on the policy, germline BRCA1/BRCA2 testing is medically necessary for individuals with metastatic prostate cancer (at any age) and for prostate cancer patients with a close relative with pancreatic cancer; the patient meets these criteria. Although pre-test counseling was not completed, the policy requirement is that testing be performed in a setting with access to counseling; the clinical indications in the policy support coverage."
Case10917,rag,iter3,Q4,"Applying the policy: the patient is a child evaluated by a genetics expert and counseled (policy criterion 1); has a policy-recognized clinical indicator (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to TPN) and relevant family history (policy guidelines); prior targeted testing (Fragile X) was nondiagnostic. Although a CMA is not documented, the combination of documented genetics evaluation, counseling, a policy-listed abnormal laboratory finding, and nondiagnostic prior targeted testing supports that WES may be considered medically necessary per the policy statements."
Case950,rag,iter1,Q5,"Under the policy, testing is medically necessary for early-onset epileptic encephalopathy/DEE and the patient has unexplained early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (onset <3 years), has no prior epilepsy multigene panel, and karyotype was nondiagnostic; these facts meet the coverage criteria."
Case5605,rag,iter1,Q5,"All required policy criteria are met: patient is pediatric (<21), has an unexplained congenital cardiac anomaly, prior CMA was nondiagnostic, and genetic evaluation/counseling was completed by a genetic specialist — therefore standard WGS may be considered medically necessary per policy I."
