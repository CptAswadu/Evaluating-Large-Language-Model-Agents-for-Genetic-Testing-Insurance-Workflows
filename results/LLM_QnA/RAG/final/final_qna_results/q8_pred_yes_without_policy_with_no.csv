Case17929,baseline,iter2,Q5,"Based on UHC coverage criteria: the child meets a covered clinical indication (major congenital/organ system abnormality), prior karyotype was nondiagnostic, counseling documented, and no disqualifying factors are present; therefore CMA is covered."
Case5605,baseline,iter2,Q5,"All applicable BCBS_FEP criteria are met: pediatric age, appropriate medical indication (major congenital cardiac anomaly), nondiagnostic prior CMA, and documented pre-test genetic counseling — therefore WGS is covered."
Case9408,baseline,iter3,Q5,"Per FEP WES coverage criteria the patient meets indication (early‑onset epileptic encephalopathy), required prior testing (nondiagnostic CMA), ordering provider (medical geneticist), and counseling requirements, so the test is covered."
Case5605,baseline,iter3,Q5,"The patient meets clinical-necessity criteria for WGS (major congenital anomaly), has a nondiagnostic prior CMA, and completed pre-test genetic counseling — aligning with BCBS_FEP coverage requirements for WGS/WES, so the test is covered."
Case10451,baseline,iter1,Q5,"From a UHC coverage-adjudication perspective the patient meets the clinical indication (unexplained moderate–severe intellectual disability), has required prior CMA testing documented as nondiagnostic, and the order is placed by an appropriate specialist (neurology); therefore WES is covered."
Case9408,baseline,iter1,Q5,"Under Blue Cross Blue Shield FEP criteria the patient meets indication (early-onset epileptic encephalopathy), required prior testing (nondiagnostic CMA), ordering provider requirements (medical geneticist), and counseling requirements; therefore WES is covered."
Case11514,baseline,iter1,Q6,"Clinical indications (early‑onset cholestasis, suspected metabolic/genetic etiology, nondiagnostic CMA, relevant family history) meet UHC medical necessity criteria for WES. The only policy deficiency is absent documented pre‑test counseling, which may require remediation but does not negate medical necessity for coverage if counseling is documented or completed per payer process."
Case13983,baseline,iter1,Q4,"Under BCBS_FEP coverage principles, WGS is considered medically necessary for infants with a suspected genetic disorder that is likely to affect acute management (significant abnormal ECG raising concern for channelopathy/arrhythmia/cardiomyopathy), family history, and when prior testing is nondiagnostic. Pre‑test genetic counseling is documented. Although additional prior tests (e.g., CMA or targeted panels) are not all documented, the clinical urgency and potential management impact support coverage."
