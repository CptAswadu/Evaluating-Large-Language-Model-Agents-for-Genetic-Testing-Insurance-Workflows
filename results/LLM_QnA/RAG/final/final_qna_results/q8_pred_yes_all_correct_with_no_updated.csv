Case10451,rag,iter2,Q5,"Under the policy WES is proven and medically necessary when all criteria are met: nonspecific/unexplained presentation, ordering provider specialty (neurologist), and a qualifying feature such as moderate–severe intellectual disability diagnosed by 18. The patient is a 10‑year‑old with moderate–severe ID, an unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder, neurologist ordered WES, and prior CMA was nondiagnostic — therefore coverage criteria are met (policy Coverage Rationale; patient info)."
Case2847,rag,iter2,Q5,"Based on the policy, WES may be considered medically necessary for children when all criteria are met. The patient is an infant with a high-risk BRUE requiring CPR (listed as a clinical feature suggesting genetic disease), prior CMA was nondiagnostic, and genetic counseling was completed—therefore the policy supports coverage."
Case3465,rag,iter2,Q5,"All policy coverage criteria for WGS are met: clinical presentation nonspecific (no specific syndrome), qualifying feature present (global developmental delay/ID), ordered by a medical geneticist, and neither CMA nor WES have been performed; genetic counseling was provided."
Case950,rag,iter2,Q5,"All required coverage criteria in the policy are met: WES ordered by a medical geneticist, nonspecific presentation, and qualifying feature 'epileptic encephalopathy with onset before three years of age.' Therefore WES is proven and medically necessary per the policy (policy Coverage Rationale)."
Case9408,rag,iter2,Q5,"Per the policy, standard WES may be considered medically necessary for children with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders when all criteria are met. The patient (age 17) has early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, was evaluated by a medical geneticist, had nondiagnostic CMA, and received pre-test counseling — meeting the policy's required criteria for coverage."
Case18882,rag,iter2,Q5,Coverage criteria are met: WES ordered by a developmental pediatrician and the patient has multiple congenital anomalies affecting different organ systems—an explicit covered indication in the policy.
Case9978,rag,iter2,Q5,"Per the UnitedHealthcare policy, WES is medically necessary when ordered by an authorized specialist and the clinical history strongly suggests a genetic cause with 'epileptic encephalopathy with onset before three years of age' — all of which are met (ordered by neurologist; onset <3 years); thus coverage is supported."
Case15820,rag,iter2,Q5,"Patient meets policy coverage criteria: living adult with unexplained DD/ID, no prior CMA, appropriate pre-test counseling, and no exclusionary family history; therefore CMA is covered per the guideline."
Case19905,rag,iter2,Q5,"Per the UnitedHealthcare WES policy, WES is medically necessary when ordered by an approved provider and the patient has qualifying features. The patient is a 3-year-old referred by a developmental pediatrician (approved ordering provider) with multiple congenital anomalies and prior nondiagnostic karyotype — meeting the policy's clinical indication for WES; genetic counseling is recommended but not required for coverage."
Case1501,rag,iter2,Q5,"Based on policy: WES is medically necessary when results are expected to influence management, ordered by an approved specialist, and clinical criteria (multiple congenital anomalies/global developmental delay) are met. The patient is a 2‑year‑old with multiple congenital anomalies and developmental concerns, prior nondiagnostic karyotype, WES ordered by a developmental pediatrician, and pre-test counseling completed. These facts satisfy the policy coverage rationale for WES (Coverage Rationale; Applicable Codes)."
Case10451,rag,iter3,Q5,"Per the UnitedHealthcare WES policy, coverage requires (1) nonspecific presentation (no well-defined syndrome), (2) ordering by an approved specialty (neurologist), and (3) presence of qualifying features such as moderate/severe ID by age 18. The patient meets these criteria and prior CMA was nondiagnostic—WES is therefore medically necessary under the policy."
Case2847,rag,iter3,Q5,"Under the FEP policy, standard WES may be considered medically necessary for children when ALL criteria are met: (1) documentation of evaluation/counseling by a genetics-expert clinician, (2) potential for change in management, and (3) prior genetic testing nondiagnostic (eg, CMA). The patient is an infant (5 weeks) with a high-risk BRUE requiring CPR (policy example of clinical feature suggesting genetic disease), prior CMA was nondiagnostic, and pre-test genetic counseling was completed. While documentation of evaluation by a clinician with genetics expertise is not explicitly stated in the record, the combination of pre-test genetic counseling, phenotype (BRUE with CPR), and nondiagnostic CMA meet the policy's clinical and prior-testing criteria supporting medical necessity for WES per the FEP policy; therefore coverage is indicated."
Case3465,rag,iter3,Q5,"From an adjudication perspective, all specified WGS coverage criteria in the policy are met: patient is a pediatric case with global developmental delay/intellectual disability (policy clinical indication), test ordered by a medical geneticist (policy ordering-provider requirement), patient is 2 years old (age criteria satisfied), CMA/WES have not been performed (policy prior-test requirement), and pre-test genetic counseling was completed (policy counseling recommendation). Therefore WGS is covered per the policy. (Policy criteria; Patient facts)"
Case950,rag,iter3,Q5,"Under UnitedHealthcare policy WES is proven and medically necessary when ordered by an appropriate specialist for nonspecific presentations and when criteria such as 'epileptic encephalopathy with onset before three years of age' are met. The patient meets these coverage criteria (medical geneticist ordering, unexplained epileptic encephalopathy with onset <3 years), so WES is covered per the policy."
Case9408,rag,iter3,Q5,"Under the FEP policy, standard WES may be considered medically necessary for children with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders when all criteria are met. The patient is a 17-year-old evaluated by a medical geneticist, has early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with prior nondiagnostic CMA, and has documented genetic counseling — satisfying the policy's required criteria, so the test is covered."
Case18882,rag,iter3,Q5,"Per the policy, WES is medically necessary when ordered by an approved specialist and the patient has nonspecific presentation with multiple congenital anomalies; the test is ordered by a developmental pediatrician, the patient meets the clinical indication (multiple congenital anomalies), and no policy-required prior testing prevents coverage."
Case9978,rag,iter3,Q5,"Per the UnitedHealthcare policy, WES is medically necessary for epileptic encephalopathy with onset before age 3 when ordered by an appropriate provider; the patient had onset <3 years, the test is ordered by a neurologist, and the indication matches policy, so WES is covered."
Case11981,rag,iter3,Q5,"Under the UnitedHealthcare policy, WGS is medically necessary when (a) neither CMA nor WES have been performed (true), (b) presentation is nonspecific and no targeted gene test fits (patient has nonspecific motor/developmental phenotype and fragile X was nondiagnostic), (c) ordered by an approved specialty (patient was referred by neurology and had pre-test discussion with a genetic specialist — consistent with neurologist/geneticist involvement), and (d) the patient has qualifying features (hypotonia/abnormal tone in infancy and ongoing neurologic/developmental concerns). Based on these facts and the policy criteria, WGS is covered."
Case15820,rag,iter3,Q5,"Based on policy criteria for CMA for developmental disorders (DD/ID), patient meets required clinical indications, has no prior CMA, fulfills counseling requirement, and is an adult; therefore the test is covered per the policy."
Case19905,rag,iter3,Q5,"Under the UHC policy WES is medically necessary when ordered by an approved specialist and one of the listed features is present. The patient is a 3-year-old referred by a developmental pediatrician (approved ordering provider) with multiple congenital anomalies and prior nondiagnostic karyotype, meeting the policy's indication for WES."
Case1501,rag,iter3,Q5,"Under the UnitedHealthcare WES coverage rationale, WES is medically necessary when ordered by a qualifying provider and when features such as multiple congenital anomalies or global developmental delay are present. The patient is a 2-year-old with multiple congenital anomalies and developmental concerns, WES ordered by a developmental pediatrician, and prior karyotype was nondiagnostic — collectively meeting the policy's coverage criteria."
Case10451,rag,iter1,Q5,"Under the UnitedHealthcare policy WES is proven/medically necessary when presentation is nonspecific, ordered by an allowed specialty, and the patient has qualifying features such as moderate/severe ID diagnosed <18. The patient is a 10-year-old with moderate–severe ID, nonspecific unexplained NDD, prior nondiagnostic CMA, and WES ordered by a neurologist — meeting policy coverage criteria for WES (policy Coverage Rationale + patient info)."
Case2847,rag,iter1,Q5,"Based on the policy: the patient is a pediatric infant, has a high-risk BRUE requiring CPR (an example clinical feature supporting WES), and prior CMA was nondiagnostic (policy pathway allows WES when prior testing failed). Pre-test genetic counseling was completed. Although evaluation by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics is required by the policy, the record documents genetic counseling (but does not explicitly document a genetics clinician evaluation). Given the documented high-risk BRUE with CPR, nondiagnostic CMA, infant age, and completed genetic counseling, the test meets the policy's medical-necessity criteria for WES."
Case950,rag,iter1,Q5,"Per the UnitedHealthcare WES policy, WES is medically necessary when criteria are met: nonspecific presentation, ordered by an approved specialist (medical geneticist), and presence of 'epileptic encephalopathy with onset before three years of age.' Patient meets these criteria (and counseling documented), so WES is covered."
Case9408,rag,iter1,Q5,"Under the FEP WES policy, standard WES is medically necessary for children with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders when all criteria are met: evaluation by a genetics expert (met), prior CMA was nondiagnostic (met), and the presentation (early-onset epileptic encephalopathy/persistent seizures) is a neurodevelopmental phenotype consistent with a genetic etiology (met). Pre-test counseling completed and plans for genetic counselor follow-up further support coverage per policy."
Case18882,rag,iter1,Q5,"Per the policy, WES is medically necessary when ordered by an approved provider type and the patient has qualifying features; the 8-year-old patient has multiple congenital anomalies affecting different organ systems and the test is ordered by a developmental pediatrician, meeting WES coverage criteria. (Policy: Coverage Rationale for WES)."
Case15820,rag,iter1,Q5,"Adjudication: patient meets policy criteria for postnatal diagnostic CMA (living adult with DD/ID, no prior CMA, counseling completed). CMA is reimbursable once per lifetime and no exclusions apply, so the test is covered per the policy."
Case19905,rag,iter1,Q5,"Per the UnitedHealthcare WES coverage rationale, WES is medically necessary when ordered by a developmental pediatrician for a nonspecific presentation and one qualifying feature is present; patient is a 3-year-old with nonspecific multiple congenital anomalies and WES is ordered by a developmental pediatrician, so coverage criteria are met."
Case1501,rag,iter1,Q5,"Under the policy WES is medically necessary when ordered by a developmental pediatrician and the individual has features such as multiple congenital anomalies and developmental delay. The 2-year-old patient has multiple congenital anomalies, developmental concerns, nondiagnostic prior karyotype, appropriate ordering provider, and completed pre-test counseling—meeting coverage criteria."
