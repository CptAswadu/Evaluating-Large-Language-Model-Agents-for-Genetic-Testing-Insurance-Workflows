sequence (e.g., updated knowledge or unrelated condition/syndrome)  \nCPT® is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association  \n \nDescription of Services  \n \nGenetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) or Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in order to inform persons being tested about the advantages and limitations of the test as applied to their unique \nsituation.  \n WES refers to the sequence determination of the exome. The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that \nencodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome.  (Chung, 2023)  \n \nMost known disease- causing variants are found in the exons, and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient \nanalysis can be completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016) . WES results in long lists \nof genetic variants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify \ndisease causing mutations . (Richards et al., 2015)  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome.  (MedlinePlus , 2020b) . This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions , and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023).  As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and  focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years . \n(Taber et al., 2015)  \n Another type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid (RNA). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transc ribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the \ncollective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA present in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology indications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM), uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at spec ific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications (Mantere et al., 2021). OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n Chung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases. The meta-analysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations over a period of 10 years (2011- 2021). Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility (defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes t o clinical management following a diagnosis by ES or GS), \nrates of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from ES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies and evaluated. The analysi s revealed comparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36- 0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall, and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35- 0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I\n2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%). Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES (2- 579 for GS vs 1- 75 for ES), but the rate of VUS was not significantly different ( p = .78). Of the \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n nine studies (2,269 probands) that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times greater than ES \n(95% CI 0.79- 1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With respect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results. Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% - 16%. A signific ant difference in the diagn ostic rate between ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2,361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40- 0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta-\nanalysis. Additionally, of ten QUADAS -2 assessed, high- quality studies (2,170 probands) reporting on clinical utility, GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30- 0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant published literature. Twenty studies, including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES  and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA, met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was potential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta- regression. Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of  the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%), and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals with short stature and provide a strong base of reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes, which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals.  \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS, for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies su pporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals with this disorder. Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of individuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023)  Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES  or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low - quality evidence was found for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified. Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis. Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately 37 art icles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affected famil y members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unexplained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by  Ewans  et al.  (2018) and Bowling  et al.  (2017), previously discussed  in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used in 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \nwere epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secon dary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS was performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year, and for those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undiagnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use of genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD. The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay (DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for this study, which took pl ace in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. They found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine experienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to \nhigh diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s participants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid- 2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative included COL2A1  (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies ( n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2- 22%). For WGS, outcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes; Hayes notes that additional studies evaluating both larger numbers and a broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n \nAn additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did does not address ID in individuals  with other disorders including NDD or global DD, which are discussed in separate Hayes reports. No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies and subtypes of NDD, Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing (NGS) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel sequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and \n28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was \nnot statically significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p =  .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found in this review compared to previous studies. The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; this systematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. In addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy, and this review included panel -based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were included. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, th is study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy, Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral palsy; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare- based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years and the health care- based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort (predominantly pediatric), molecular diagnostic yield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort (predominantly adult), it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participan ts and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts. Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for sequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care- based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized tria l incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days). The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 day s (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants \nwere racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that twice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group receive d a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed group at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study, however, showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical \nmanagement and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for criti cally ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretati on of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a lower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined in this study.  \n In a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who \nwere recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequ encing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, \nophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rhe umatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for cases with etiologic noncoding, structural and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for clinical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical outcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Malinowski et al. (2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS. \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy. Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was identified. Ultimately, 167 articles were i ncluded; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly al l included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision- making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by St ark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al. (2016), Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al.  \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Malinowski et al. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 participants that were extensively ph enotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare \ndiseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolomics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of ad ults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately \n6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to  aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020) examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASDs  (n = 4), DD/ID ( n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting. A total of  37 pathogenic /likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals  (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the \nSNVs identified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3%. For the individuals that had positive results, \n36.7% and 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals  \nwith DD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their cohort \ncompared to traditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that t hey also achieved their secondary objectives \nof decreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluations) addressed ES for use in individuals with (NDDs). \nThe study included a meta- analysis and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES \nwith that of CMA in affected individuals. The study defined NDD as global DD, ID and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles \naddressing diagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of \nES was 36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions), which is substantially greater \nthan previous studies focused on CMA (15- 20%). The researchers conclude that the study showed consistently better \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have been less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneous cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing. Publications by  Vissers et al.  (2017), Tarailo- Graovac  et al.  (2016), Retterer  et al.  \n(2016) , and Lee  et al.  (2014), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in the Srivastava systematic review and \nmeta- analysis.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 11 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Groopman et al. (2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 \nyears of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnostic resul t in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionabl e findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score and standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and \nfor the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes. In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) w ere found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome analysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes, however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH -funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none of which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance \nrate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malformations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub- group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early \nintervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome,  type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset  disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and  were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT  and G6PD . Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could impact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines arise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by fact ors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond that currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.   \n In order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was 2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were \nfound, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n As part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield. In some cases, family testing was performed to \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 12 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n determine gene segregation and verify pathogenicity. The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent specialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary spastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n Bardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical \nindications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing for Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes \nwere selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in \n52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platforms or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the involvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.   \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August \n2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta‐ analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utilit y of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of WES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WGS and WES was not significantly different. In studies with in-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference lab interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statisticall y significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnosti c rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be considered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n \nThe diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One B RCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a \nchange in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/601, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non- sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling for variant discussion.  \n \nAnother study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a \ncohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioRe source Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality was poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate varied by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individua ls had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that \nthe WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection rate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 –5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from consan guineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A, PPOX, FRMPD4, and SCN1B, and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a fi rst-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics ’ laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n neurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening  \nA 2023 systematic review and meta- analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Seco ndary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 47%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9- 24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27- 51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time for CMA/WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended.  Publications by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies \nwhere CMA had been negative. Testing took place between the 12th and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded ( n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm). For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence variation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was \n40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS, related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply. The researchers assert that although this \nstudy  is limited by small sample size, the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use.  \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies w ere included in this review, representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled incremental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre- selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases ( 42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these \nresults, the researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a di agnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with \nstructural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending \non the body system impacted and can be increased by specific pre- selection of cases after a  multi- disciplinary review \nindicating likelihood of a monogenic cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies \nthat were evaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of analysis which likely impact diagnostic yield  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of \nprenatal ES to gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritize cases for testing and the challenges that exist for interpreting variants w ith incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding \nphenotype. Publications by  Chen et al.  (2020), Deden et al.  (2020), Lord et al.  (2019), Petrovski  et al.  (2019) , Aarabi  et al.  \n(2018),  Fu et al.  (2018) , and Normand et al.  (2018), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in this systematic \nreview.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 15 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were obtained prior to exome analysis. After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely path ogenic variants were \nidentified that were de termined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progressed. The authors \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogeni c variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta- analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies) with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yield of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these, 42% of variants were \nhomozygous. Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appe ar to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndromes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon.  \n \nA 2020 (updated 2023 ) Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS related to \nimprovement of diagnosis and assistance with pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are \ndetected by ultrasound or other testing is lacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for the use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologi c diseases. Specifically, relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions and deletions and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP). This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals, 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels. Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platform used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals, which, according to their referring clinicians, would ena ble \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to lead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to efficient re analysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n In an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children  \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \nundiagnosed c hildren who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re- evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of better bioinformatic pipelines, improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification of previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact  the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. The study showed that not all afflicted individuals will undergo routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey, \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting and considered all di sease- related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new di agnoses, however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The \nliterature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examined 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two years of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new \ndiagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs. The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n \nAlfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of WES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton \nsystem. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs may  not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the study and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclusive WES results. Most were male (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patien ts \nhad complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS results with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because the data that demonstrated their pathogenicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original \nraw data files were not available from this lab to determin e if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four \nvariants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re- analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n and the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of positives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n \nTo evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis, Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date soft ware and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnosti c exomes. This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 –3-year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of relat ionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround- times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinical utility of these rapid and ult ra-rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra -rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), \ndiscussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gu bbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nDimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed had cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in \nGenomic Medicine and  Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). \nThe goal of the NSIGHT study was to comp are two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two \ninterpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who \nreceived urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra-\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 \nhours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. O f the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, respectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n urWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0.0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \nwere randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, cr itically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to l ess seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of bot h tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with undiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30- 50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. Sanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings outside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n \nClark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a provisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the \nmean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four timed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling took \na median of 1 hour and is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant variants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and \noptimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and l ogical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was selected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospecti vely in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with t wo children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the \nprior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously il l infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 hours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger sequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Whole Transcriptome Sequencing  \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS. The results of RNAseq were combined with gen ome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional seven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels, and SVs were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 samples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7– 27%), bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29 –48%). The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of RNAseq. The study was limited by its small cohort size which underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center, \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional \nstudies on broader populations and focused on improv ement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication. Although it shows early promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, further development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential clinical \nutility.  \n Mantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities in a proof -of-principle study. In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra- high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM. The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not ( n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders ( n = 15), family history of chromosome abnormality ( n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound ( n = \n9). The result was compared to known anomalies obtained via current standard- of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities. They foresee continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- quality clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n \nAdditional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications . (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023)  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified \nthrough routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available. Evidence \nLevel C . (Kang et al., 2015, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 20 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nIn an AANEM 2016 consensus statement, the group stated that while they do not endorse or recommend a specific \ntesting methodology, genetic testing to establish a molecular diagnosis is a crucial step in providing optimal care to \nindividuals with neuromuscular disorders . (Kassardjian et al., 2016, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \nIn a 2021 practice guideline authored by Manickam et al., the ACMG asserts their position that evidenced- based literature \nsupports clinical utility of whole exome and whole genome sequencing on both active and long- term management of \nindividuals with congenital anomalies, developmental delay and intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). Based on their comprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first - or second - tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of standard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0 (Miller et al., 2021b), contained 73 genes and detailed the way that genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list (v3.1); a total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR  (hereditary TTR amyloidosis). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome), bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n Monaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health- care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be obtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n A 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test results. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re- evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory work collaboratively in the testing process.”  \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significance,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the i nterpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole-\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”   \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021) addressing the management of stillbirth indicates that whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023)  Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances (e.g., fetuses with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific  genes of  clinical interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances, WES or WGS  may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG, and Horizon 2020 project Solve- RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases using various analytical techniques. The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, \nefficiency and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed \nin accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal anomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple organ system anomalies ; and \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies ; and \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a fetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline . \n \nThe guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or neurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and \ncomprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)  \nIn a 2022 evidence- based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology. The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing, followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider \nin the context of appropriate pre-  and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n \nThis section is to be used for informational purposes only.

sequence (e.g., updated knowledge or unrelated condition/syndrome)  \nCPT® is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association  \n \nDescription of Services  \n \nGenetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) or Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in order to inform persons being tested about the advantages and limitations of the test as applied to their unique \nsituation.  \n WES refers to the sequence determination of the exome. The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that \nencodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome.  (Chung, 2023)  \n \nMost known disease- causing variants are found in the exons, and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient \nanalysis can be completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016) . WES results in long lists \nof genetic variants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify \ndisease causing mutations . (Richards et al., 2015)  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome.  (MedlinePlus , 2020b) . This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions , and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023).  As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and  focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years . \n(Taber et al., 2015)  \n Another type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid (RNA). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transc ribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the \ncollective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA present in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology indications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM), uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at spec ific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications (Mantere et al., 2021). OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n Chung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases. The meta-analysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations over a period of 10 years (2011- 2021). Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility (defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes t o clinical management following a diagnosis by ES or GS), \nrates of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from ES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies and evaluated. The analysi s revealed comparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36- 0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall, and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35- 0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I\n2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%). Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES (2- 579 for GS vs 1- 75 for ES), but the rate of VUS was not significantly different ( p = .78). Of the \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n nine studies (2,269 probands) that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times greater than ES \n(95% CI 0.79- 1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With respect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results. Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% - 16%. A signific ant difference in the diagn ostic rate between ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2,361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40- 0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta-\nanalysis. Additionally, of ten QUADAS -2 assessed, high- quality studies (2,170 probands) reporting on clinical utility, GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30- 0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant published literature. Twenty studies, including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES  and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA, met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was potential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta- regression. Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of  the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%), and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals with short stature and provide a strong base of reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes, which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals.  \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS, for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies su pporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals with this disorder. Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of individuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023)  Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES  or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low - quality evidence was found for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified. Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis. Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately 37 art icles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affected famil y members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unexplained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by  Ewans  et al.  (2018) and Bowling  et al.  (2017), previously discussed  in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used in 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \nwere epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secon dary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS was performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year, and for those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undiagnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use of genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD. The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay (DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for this study, which took pl ace in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. They found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine experienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to \nhigh diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s participants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid- 2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative included COL2A1  (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies ( n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2- 22%). For WGS, outcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes; Hayes notes that additional studies evaluating both larger numbers and a broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n \nAn additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did does not address ID in individuals  with other disorders including NDD or global DD, which are discussed in separate Hayes reports. No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies and subtypes of NDD, Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing (NGS) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel sequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and \n28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was \nnot statically significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p =  .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found in this review compared to previous studies. The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; this systematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. In addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy, and this review included panel -based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were included. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, th is study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy, Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral palsy; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare- based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years and the health care- based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort (predominantly pediatric), molecular diagnostic yield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort (predominantly adult), it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participan ts and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts. Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for sequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care- based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized tria l incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days). The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 day s (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants \nwere racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that twice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group receive d a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed group at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study, however, showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical \nmanagement and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for criti cally ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretati on of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a lower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined in this study.  \n In a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who \nwere recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequ encing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, \nophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rhe umatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for cases with etiologic noncoding, structural and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for clinical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical outcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Malinowski et al. (2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS. \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy. Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was identified. Ultimately, 167 articles were i ncluded; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly al l included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision- making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by St ark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al. (2016), Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al.  \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Malinowski et al. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 participants that were extensively ph enotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare \ndiseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolomics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of ad ults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately \n6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to  aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020) examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASDs  (n = 4), DD/ID ( n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting. A total of  37 pathogenic /likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals  (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the \nSNVs identified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3%. For the individuals that had positive results, \n36.7% and 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals  \nwith DD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their cohort \ncompared to traditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that t hey also achieved their secondary objectives \nof decreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluations) addressed ES for use in individuals with (NDDs). \nThe study included a meta- analysis and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES \nwith that of CMA in affected individuals. The study defined NDD as global DD, ID and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles \naddressing diagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of \nES was 36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions), which is substantially greater \nthan previous studies focused on CMA (15- 20%). The researchers conclude that the study showed consistently better \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have been less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneous cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing. Publications by  Vissers et al.  (2017), Tarailo- Graovac  et al.  (2016), Retterer  et al.  \n(2016) , and Lee  et al.  (2014), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in the Srivastava systematic review and \nmeta- analysis.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 11 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Groopman et al. (2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 \nyears of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnostic resul t in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionabl e findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score and standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and \nfor the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes. In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) w ere found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome analysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes, however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH -funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none of which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance \nrate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malformations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub- group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early \nintervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome,  type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset  disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and  were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT  and G6PD . Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could impact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines arise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by fact ors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond that currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.   \n In order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was 2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were \nfound, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n As part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield.

The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent specialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary spastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n Bardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical \nindications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing for Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes \nwere selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in \n52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platforms or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the involvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.   \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August \n2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta‐ analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utilit y of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of WES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WGS and WES was not significantly different. In studies with in-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference lab interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statisticall y significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnosti c rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be considered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n \nThe diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One B RCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a \nchange in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/601, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non- sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling for variant discussion.  \n \nAnother study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a \ncohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioRe source Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality was poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate varied by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individua ls had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that \nthe WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection rate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 –5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from consan guineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A, PPOX, FRMPD4, and SCN1B, and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a fi rst-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics ’ laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n neurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening  \nA 2023 systematic review and meta- analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Seco ndary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 47%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9- 24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27- 51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time for CMA/WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended.  Publications by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies \nwhere CMA had been negative. Testing took place between the 12th and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded ( n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm). For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence variation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was \n40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS, related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply. The researchers assert that although this \nstudy  is limited by small sample size, the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use.  \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies w ere included in this review, representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled incremental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre- selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases ( 42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these \nresults, the researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a di agnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with \nstructural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending \non the body system impacted and can be increased by specific pre- selection of cases after a  multi- disciplinary review \nindicating likelihood of a monogenic cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies \nthat were evaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of analysis which likely impact diagnostic yield  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of \nprenatal ES to gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritize cases for testing and the challenges that exist for interpreting variants w ith incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding \nphenotype. Publications by  Chen et al.  (2020), Deden et al.  (2020), Lord et al.  (2019), Petrovski  et al.  (2019) , Aarabi  et al.  \n(2018),  Fu et al.  (2018) , and Normand et al.  (2018), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in this systematic \nreview.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 15 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were obtained prior to exome analysis. After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely path ogenic variants were \nidentified that were de termined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progressed. The authors \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogeni c variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta- analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies) with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yield of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these, 42% of variants were \nhomozygous. Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appe ar to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndromes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon.  \n \nA 2020 (updated 2023 ) Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS related to \nimprovement of diagnosis and assistance with pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are \ndetected by ultrasound or other testing is lacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for the use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologi c diseases. Specifically, relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions and deletions and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP). This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals, 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels. Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platform used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals, which, according to their referring clinicians, would ena ble \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to lead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to efficient re analysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n In an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children  \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \nundiagnosed c hildren who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re- evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of better bioinformatic pipelines, improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification of previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact  the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. The study showed that not all afflicted individuals will undergo routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey, \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting and considered all di sease- related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new di agnoses, however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The \nliterature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examined 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two years of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new \ndiagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs. The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n \nAlfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of WES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton \nsystem. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs may  not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the study and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclusive WES results. Most were male (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patien ts \nhad complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS results with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because the data that demonstrated their pathogenicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original \nraw data files were not available from this lab to determin e if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four \nvariants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re- analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n and the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of positives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n \nTo evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis, Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date soft ware and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnosti c exomes. This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 –3-year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of relat ionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround- times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinical utility of these rapid and ult ra-rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra -rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), \ndiscussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gu bbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nDimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed had cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in \nGenomic Medicine and  Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). \nThe goal of the NSIGHT study was to comp are two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two \ninterpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who \nreceived urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra-\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 \nhours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. O f the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, respectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n urWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0.0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \nwere randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, cr itically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to l ess seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of bot h tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with undiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30- 50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. Sanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings outside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n \nClark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a provisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the \nmean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four timed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling took \na median of 1 hour and is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant variants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and \noptimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and l ogical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was selected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospecti vely in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with t wo children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the \nprior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously il l infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 hours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger sequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Whole Transcriptome Sequencing  \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS. The results of RNAseq were combined with gen ome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional seven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels, and SVs were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 samples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7– 27%), bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29 –48%). The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of RNAseq. The study was limited by its small cohort size which underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center, \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional \nstudies on broader populations and focused on improv ement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication. Although it shows early promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, further development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential clinical \nutility.  \n Mantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities in a proof -of-principle study. In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra- high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM. The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not ( n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders ( n = 15), family history of chromosome abnormality ( n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound ( n = \n9). The result was compared to known anomalies obtained via current standard- of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities. They foresee continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- quality clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n \nAdditional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications . (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023)  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified \nthrough routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available. Evidence \nLevel C . (Kang et al., 2015, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 20 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nIn an AANEM 2016 consensus statement, the group stated that while they do not endorse or recommend a specific \ntesting methodology, genetic testing to establish a molecular diagnosis is a crucial step in providing optimal care to \nindividuals with neuromuscular disorders . (Kassardjian et al., 2016, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \nIn a 2021 practice guideline authored by Manickam et al., the ACMG asserts their position that evidenced- based literature \nsupports clinical utility of whole exome and whole genome sequencing on both active and long- term management of \nindividuals with congenital anomalies, developmental delay and intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). Based on their comprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first - or second - tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of standard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0 (Miller et al., 2021b), contained 73 genes and detailed the way that genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list (v3.1); a total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR  (hereditary TTR amyloidosis). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome), bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n Monaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health- care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be obtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n A 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test results. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re- evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory work collaboratively in the testing process.”  \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significance,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the i nterpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole-\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”   \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021) addressing the management of stillbirth indicates that whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023)  Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances (e.g., fetuses with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific  genes of  clinical interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances, WES or WGS  may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG, and Horizon 2020 project Solve- RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases using various analytical techniques. The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, \nefficiency and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed \nin accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal anomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple organ system anomalies ; and \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies ; and \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a fetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline . \n \nThe guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or neurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and \ncomprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)  \nIn a 2022 evidence- based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology. The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing, followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider \nin the context of appropriate pre-  and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n \nThis section is to be used for informational purposes only.

About 5-10% of cancer has a hereditary etiology due to constitutional \ngermline mutations.1 \nIn oncology, next generation sequencing (NGS) technology makes it feasible to \ncatalog the DNA sequence mutations within a person’s cancer (i.e., somatic \nmutation profiling). This helps define therapeutic targets which might improve \n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

Most PPGVs (80.5%, 95% CI, 75.1%-85.0%) were in genes \nrelated to cancer susceptibility. The PPGVs in genes previously designated as \nclinically actionable cancer targets were seen in 5.0% (95% CI, 4.1%-6.2%) of \nindividuals. Most cancer-susceptibility PPGVs were retained in the tumor \n(91.9%; 95% CI, 87.3%-95.0%).5 This study is in line with other published \nstudies investigating the prevalence of incidental findings with somatic tumor \nprofiling.” 5-7 \nThe debate continues regarding whether there is an obligation to test for and report \nthese germline findings, which are secondary to the original purpose of somatic \ntumor profiling. In making this determination, pre-test informed consent is of utmost \nimportance. “Honoring patient preferences requires oncology providers to \ncommunicate the potential for incidental and secondary germline information \nspecific to the test being offered, the relevance and potential benefits of this \ninformation for patients and their relatives, and the limitations and risks of receiving \nincidental and secondary germline information”  2 \nTest information \nIntroduction \nMutations detected on somatic testing may be indicative of a hereditary cancer \nsyndrome due to a germline mutation. Thus, germline hereditary cancer testing \nfollowing somatic tumor testing may be indicated in certain situations.\nTesting to investigate somatic and germline DNA mutations has become more \ncommon as sequencing technology has evolved from the more labor intensive \nSanger sequencing to next generation sequencing (NGS). “NGS is a powerful \ntechnology that permits the characterization of large amounts of DNA sequence \nmuch quicker and at lower cost than traditional Sanger sequencing.”  2 \n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

These guidelines were recently updated\n(ESMO, 2023) and stated:14\n\"We analysed an expanded dataset including 49 264 paired tumour-normal \nsamples. We applied filters to tumour-detected variants based on variant allele \nfrequency, predicted pathogenicity and population variant frequency. For 58 cancer-\nsusceptibility genes, we then examined the proportion of filtered tumour-detected \nvariants of true germline origin [germline conversion rate (GCR)]. We conducted \nsubanalyses based on the age of cancer diagnosis, specific tumour types and 'on-\ntumour' status (established tumour-gene association).\"\nForty genes were identified for potential germline follow-up testing. \nFour different approaches were provided for germline follow-up of tumor-only \nsequencing results: \no\"Permissive: germline follow-up for all 40 genes in all tumour types\noIntermediate-permissive: germline follow-up for all 23 MA-CSGs/HA-CSGs \n[most-actionability cancer-susceptibility gene/high-actionability cancer-\nsusceptibility gene] in all tumour types but germline follow-up only in 'associated'\ntumour types for 17 SA-CSGs [standard-actionability cancer-susceptibility gene].\noIntermediate-conservative: germline follow-up in all tumour types for the 7 MA-\nCSGs but germline follow-up only in 'associated' tumour types for the other 33 \nHA-CSGs/SA-CSGs. \noConservative: germline follow-up only in 'associated' tumour types for all 40 \ngenes\"\n\"Strategic filtering improves the GCR with minimal loss of true germline variants \npresent in the tumour.\"\n\"GCR of filtered tumour-detected variants is very high (>80%) for genes such as \nBRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2.\"\n\"GCR of filtered tumour-detected variants is very low (<2%) for genes such as APC,\nTP53 and STK11.\"\n\"Germline follow-up should involve multidisciplinary expertise and follow expert \nguidance regarding tumour context.\"\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network \nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN, 2024) stated the following \nregarding germline testing following somatic tumor testing:15\n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

However, \nthe absence of a P/LP [pathogenic/likely pathogenic] variant for a given gene from \ntumor profiling does not rule out the possibility of a germline P/LP variant in that \ngene… Therefore, a variant interpreted as P/LP in the germline may be interpreted \nas normal or as a VUS in the tumor, if that variant has no clear clinical implications. \nIn addition, the sensitivity of most tumor testing is lower (particularly for \nintermediate-sized deletions and duplications) than that for most dedicated germline\ntests, sometimes due to filtering out of germline findings reported in tumor \nsequencing results.\"\n“If a mutation is detected through tumor profiling that has clinical implications if \nidentified in the germline, then germline testing for this variant is indicated.\"\n\"Somatic P/LP variants seen in tumor specimens are common in some genes with \ngermline implications (eg, TP53, STK11, PTEN) and may not indicate the need for \ngermline testing unless the clinical/family history is consistent with a P/LP variant in \nthe germline.\"\n\"If a patient meets testing criteria for germline testing for a given gene, then \nconfirmatory germline testing should be considered through a CLIA-approved lab \ndespite tumor profiling results.\" \nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN, 2023) stated the following \nregarding interpreting information obtained from tumor-only profiling:16\n“Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants reported by laboratories providing tumor-only\nprofiling may be of somatic or germline origin. Although germline origin can \nsometimes be inferred with a high degree of confidence, confirmatory germline \ntesting is indicated for pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants with a reasonable \nclinical suspicion of being of germline origin (based on patient/family history or \nclinical characteristics, presence of a founder mutation, and in some cases variant \nallele frequency).\" \n\"Somatic pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in several genes with germline \nimplications are common (e.g., TP53, STK11, PTEN, APC), and will rarely be \nindicative of a need for germline testing unless clinical/family history features \nsuggest the possibility of a germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant.\"\n“It should be noted that the absence of reported pathogenic/likely pathogenic \nvariants in a particular gene based on tumor testing does not rule out the possibility \nof a germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in that gene.

If not,\nno further testing is indicated based on the somatic results. If so, then determine if \nthe testing performed on the tumor was tumor paired with a normal sample such as \nblood or saliva. If it was paired testing, then determine if the mutation is a founder \nmutation or if the mutation is present in a relative to determine if confirmatory \ngermline testing is necessary. Additionally, following-up with the testing laboratory to\ndetermine their germline confirmation policy may be necessary. \nIf the testing was on tumor only, the following was stated: \noIf the following apply, then the mutation is likely somatic and no further testing \nmay be indicated based on the somatic results: \nThe variant allele frequency is less 30%\nThe gene mutation(s) is/are associated with the tumor type\nThere is a lacking phenotype consistent with the gene mutation\nThe individual's age of diagnosis is not consistent with the gene mutation\noIf any of the following apply and the mutation is classified as pathogenic/likely \npathogenic when present in the germline, then confirmatory genetic testing is \nappropriate: \nThe variant allele frequency is 30% or greater\nThe phenotype matches the gene mutation\nThe individual's age at diagnosis is consistent with the gene mutation\nOf note, if a mutation is not found in databases to confirm pathogenicity, \nconfirmatory testing may still be indicated.\noIf the gene change is classified as a variant of uncertain significance when \npresent in the germline, confirmatory germline testing is generally not indicated \nhowever could be considered if: \nGermline testing may be of benefit to the individual/family in the future\nThe individual/family are eligible for family or follow-up studies\nThere is clinical suspicion about the gene change\noIf the gene change is classified as benign/likely benign when present in the \ngermline, no further testing in indicated based on the somatic results.\nAdditionally points noted were: \n\"Consider multigene panel testing rather than targeted variant testing based on \npersonal/family history of cancer AND/OR other NCCN criteria met for germline \ntesting.\"\n\"Germline testing may be necessary despite paired tumor-normal report.

The testing is not designed to elucidate a hereditary etiology. A germline\nvariant may not be detected (due to differences in coverage in the testing, \ncellularity of the sample, allelic loss of the germline mutation) or may not be \nreported by the somatic testing laboratory.2,3,18,19 \noDirected germline genetic testing can be ordered to identify a potential \nhereditary etiology for the person’s tumor. Referrals to oncology genetic \ncounselors or other specialized healthcare providers should occur if the \nindividual’s personal and/or family history meets established criteria to warrant a\nmore detailed discussion.13,18,20 \noAncillary findings from somatic or germline testing may include variants in genes\nthat cause a hereditary cancer syndrome, a non-oncologic hereditary syndrome,\nor identify carrier status for Mendelian disease. Specific findings are dependent \non specific testing performed by the laboratory.2,3,10,11,18 \noMany individuals undergoing somatic tumor profiling have advanced stage \ndisease. Centers performing somatic tumor profiling should consider obtaining a\nsurrogate individual to receive results in the event that the proband has passed \naway or is otherwise unable to receive the results.2,3,18 \nPost-test considerations: \noClinicians must determine the technical specifications of the laboratory used for \nsomatic tumor profiling and determine if this includes paired germline testing. \nSome laboratories may not report germline variants, include certain known \ngermline variants on a panel, or be able to detect certain types of variants (such \nas copy number variants) depending on the assay methodology used.2,3,21 \noSomatic variant interpretation differs from the variant interpretation and \nclassification process for germline variants. For example, a laboratory profiling a\nsomatic tumor may classify a certain variant as pathogenic whereas a laboratory\ntesting a germline mutation may classify that same variant as a variant of \nuncertain significance (VUS), or vice versa.2,3,21 Resources, such as ClinVar, \nshould be used by the provider to determine if a pathogenic variant classification\nprovided by germline testing laboratories is consistent with independent \nassessments of that variant.22 \noReferrals to oncology genetic counselors or other specialized healthcare \nproviders should occur if the individual’s personal and/or family history meets \nestablished criteria to warrant a more detailed discussion, regardless of somatic \ntumor profiling results.10,16,18 In individuals meeting criteria for germline DNA \n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

(UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company Generic Certificate of Coverage 20 24) \n Next Generation Sequencing (NGS):  New sequencing techniques that can quickly analyze multiple sections of DNA at \nthe same time. Older forms of sequencing could only analyze one section of DNA at once.  \n \nPreimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT):  A test performed to analyze the DNA from oocytes or embryos for human \nleukocyte antigen (HLA) -typing or for determining genetic abnormalities. These include:  \n PGT-A: For aneuploidy screening (formerly PGS)  \n PGT-M: For  monogenic/single gene defects (formerly single- gene PGD)  \n PGT-SR: For  chromosomal structural rearrangements (formerly chromosomal PGD)  \n(Zegers -Hochschild et al., 2017)  \n \n \nVariant of Unknown Significance (VUS):  A variation in a genetic sequence that has an unknown association with \ndisease. It may also be called an unclassified variant . (MedlinePlus 2020c)  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing (WES):  About 1% of a person’s DNA makes protein. These protein making sections are \ncalled exons. All the exons together are called the exome. WES is a DNA analysis technique that looks at all of the exons \nin a person at one time, rather than gene by gene.  (MedlinePlus , 2020b) \n \nWhole Genome Sequencing (WGS):  WGS determines the sequence of all of the DNA in a person, which includes the \nprotein making (coding) as well as non- coding DNA elements .

sequence (e.g., updated knowledge or unrelated condition/syndrome)  \nCPT® is a registered trademark of the American Medical Association  \n \nDescription of Services  \n \nGenetic counseling is strongly recommended prior to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) or Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in order to inform persons being tested about the advantages and limitations of the test as applied to their unique \nsituation.  \n WES refers to the sequence determination of the exome. The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that \nencodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome.  (Chung, 2023)  \n \nMost known disease- causing variants are found in the exons, and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient \nanalysis can be completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016) . WES results in long lists \nof genetic variants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify \ndisease causing mutations . (Richards et al., 2015)  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome.  (MedlinePlus , 2020b) . This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions , and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023).  As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and  focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years . \n(Taber et al., 2015)  \n Another type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid (RNA). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transc ribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the \ncollective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA present in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology indications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM), uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at spec ific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications (Mantere et al., 2021). OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n Chung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases. The meta-analysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations over a period of 10 years (2011- 2021). Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility (defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes t o clinical management following a diagnosis by ES or GS), \nrates of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from ES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies and evaluated. The analysi s revealed comparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36- 0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall, and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35- 0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I\n2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%). Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES (2- 579 for GS vs 1- 75 for ES), but the rate of VUS was not significantly different ( p = .78). Of the \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n nine studies (2,269 probands) that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times greater than ES \n(95% CI 0.79- 1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With respect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results. Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% - 16%. A signific ant difference in the diagn ostic rate between ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2,361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40- 0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta-\nanalysis. Additionally, of ten QUADAS -2 assessed, high- quality studies (2,170 probands) reporting on clinical utility, GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30- 0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant published literature. Twenty studies, including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES  and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA, met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was potential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta- regression. Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of  the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%), and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals with short stature and provide a strong base of reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes, which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals.  \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS, for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies su pporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals with this disorder. Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of individuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023)  Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES  or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low - quality evidence was found for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified. Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis. Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately 37 art icles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affected famil y members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unexplained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by  Ewans  et al.  (2018) and Bowling  et al.  (2017), previously discussed  in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used in 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \nwere epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secon dary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS was performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year, and for those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undiagnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use of genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD. The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay (DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for this study, which took pl ace in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. They found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine experienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to \nhigh diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s participants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid- 2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative included COL2A1  (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies ( n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2- 22%). For WGS, outcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes; Hayes notes that additional studies evaluating both larger numbers and a broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n \nAn additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did does not address ID in individuals  with other disorders including NDD or global DD, which are discussed in separate Hayes reports. No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies and subtypes of NDD, Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing (NGS) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel sequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and \n28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was \nnot statically significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p =  .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found in this review compared to previous studies. The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; this systematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. In addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy, and this review included panel -based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were included. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, th is study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy, Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral palsy; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare- based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years and the health care- based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort (predominantly pediatric), molecular diagnostic yield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort (predominantly adult), it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participan ts and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts. Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for sequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care- based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized tria l incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days). The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 day s (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants \nwere racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that twice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group receive d a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed group at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study, however, showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical \nmanagement and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for criti cally ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretati on of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a lower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined in this study.  \n In a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who \nwere recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequ encing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, \nophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rhe umatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for cases with etiologic noncoding, structural and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for clinical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical outcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Malinowski et al. (2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS. \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy. Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was identified. Ultimately, 167 articles were i ncluded; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly al l included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision- making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by St ark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al. (2016), Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al.  \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Malinowski et al. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 participants that were extensively ph enotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare \ndiseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolomics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of ad ults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately \n6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to  aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020) examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASDs  (n = 4), DD/ID ( n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting. A total of  37 pathogenic /likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals  (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the \nSNVs identified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3%. For the individuals that had positive results, \n36.7% and 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals  \nwith DD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their cohort \ncompared to traditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that t hey also achieved their secondary objectives \nof decreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluations) addressed ES for use in individuals with (NDDs). \nThe study included a meta- analysis and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES \nwith that of CMA in affected individuals. The study defined NDD as global DD, ID and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles \naddressing diagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of \nES was 36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions), which is substantially greater \nthan previous studies focused on CMA (15- 20%). The researchers conclude that the study showed consistently better \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have been less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneous cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing. Publications by  Vissers et al.  (2017), Tarailo- Graovac  et al.  (2016), Retterer  et al.  \n(2016) , and Lee  et al.  (2014), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in the Srivastava systematic review and \nmeta- analysis.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 11 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Groopman et al. (2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 \nyears of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnostic resul t in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionabl e findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score and standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and \nfor the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes. In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) w ere found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome analysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes, however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH -funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none of which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance \nrate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malformations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub- group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early \nintervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome,  type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset  disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and  were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT  and G6PD . Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could impact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines arise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by fact ors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond that currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.   \n In order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was 2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were \nfound, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n As part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield. In some cases, family testing was performed to \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 12 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n determine gene segregation and verify pathogenicity. The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent specialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary spastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n Bardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical \nindications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing for Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes \nwere selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in \n52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platforms or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the involvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.   \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August \n2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta‐ analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utilit y of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of WES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WGS and WES was not significantly different. In studies with in-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference lab interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statisticall y significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnosti c rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be considered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n \nThe diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One B RCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a \nchange in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/601, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non- sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling for variant discussion.  \n \nAnother study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a \ncohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioRe source Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality was poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate varied by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individua ls had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that \nthe WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection rate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 –5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from consan guineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A, PPOX, FRMPD4, and SCN1B, and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a fi rst-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics ’ laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n neurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening  \nA 2023 systematic review and meta- analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Seco ndary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 47%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9- 24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27- 51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time for CMA/WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended.  Publications by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies \nwhere CMA had been negative. Testing took place between the 12th and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded ( n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm). For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence variation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was \n40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS, related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply. The researchers assert that although this \nstudy  is limited by small sample size, the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use.  \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies w ere included in this review, representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled incremental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre- selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases ( 42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these \nresults, the researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a di agnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with \nstructural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending \non the body system impacted and can be increased by specific pre- selection of cases after a  multi- disciplinary review \nindicating likelihood of a monogenic cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies \nthat were evaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of analysis which likely impact diagnostic yield  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of \nprenatal ES to gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritize cases for testing and the challenges that exist for interpreting variants w ith incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding \nphenotype.

(2018), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in this systematic \nreview.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 15 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were obtained prior to exome analysis. After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely path ogenic variants were \nidentified that were de termined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progressed. The authors \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogeni c variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta- analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies) with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yield of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these, 42% of variants were \nhomozygous. Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appe ar to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndromes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon.  \n \nA 2020 (updated 2023 ) Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS related to \nimprovement of diagnosis and assistance with pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are \ndetected by ultrasound or other testing is lacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for the use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologi c diseases. Specifically, relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions and deletions and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP). This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals, 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels. Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platform used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals, which, according to their referring clinicians, would ena ble \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to lead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to efficient re analysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n In an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children  \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \nundiagnosed c hildren who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re- evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of better bioinformatic pipelines, improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification of previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact  the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. The study showed that not all afflicted individuals will undergo routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey, \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting and considered all di sease- related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new di agnoses, however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The \nliterature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examined 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two years of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new \ndiagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs. The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n \nAlfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of WES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton \nsystem. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs may  not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the study and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclusive WES results. Most were male (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patien ts \nhad complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS results with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because the data that demonstrated their pathogenicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original \nraw data files were not available from this lab to determin e if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four \nvariants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re- analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n and the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of positives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n \nTo evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis, Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date soft ware and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnosti c exomes. This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 –3-year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of relat ionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround- times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinical utility of these rapid and ult ra-rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra -rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), \ndiscussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gu bbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nDimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed had cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in \nGenomic Medicine and  Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). \nThe goal of the NSIGHT study was to comp are two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two \ninterpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who \nreceived urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra-\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 \nhours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. O f the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, respectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n urWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0.0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \nwere randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, cr itically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to l ess seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of bot h tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with undiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30- 50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. Sanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings outside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n \nClark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a provisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the \nmean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four timed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling took \na median of 1 hour and is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant variants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and \noptimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and l ogical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was selected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospecti vely in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with t wo children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the \nprior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously il l infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 hours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger sequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Whole Transcriptome Sequencing  \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS. The results of RNAseq were combined with gen ome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional seven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels, and SVs were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 samples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7– 27%), bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29 –48%). The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of RNAseq. The study was limited by its small cohort size which underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center, \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional \nstudies on broader populations and focused on improv ement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication. Although it shows early promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, further development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential clinical \nutility.  \n Mantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities in a proof -of-principle study. In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra- high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM. The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not ( n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders ( n = 15), family history of chromosome abnormality ( n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound ( n = \n9). The result was compared to known anomalies obtained via current standard- of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities. They foresee continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- quality clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n \nAdditional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications . (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023)  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified \nthrough routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available.

Based on their comprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first - or second - tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of standard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0 (Miller et al., 2021b), contained 73 genes and detailed the way that genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list (v3.1); a total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR  (hereditary TTR amyloidosis). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome), bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n Monaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health- care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be obtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n A 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test results. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re- evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory work collaboratively in the testing process.”  \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significance,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the i nterpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole-\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”   \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021) addressing the management of stillbirth indicates that whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023)  Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances (e.g., fetuses with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific  genes of  clinical interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances, WES or WGS  may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG, and Horizon 2020 project Solve- RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases using various analytical techniques. The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, \nefficiency and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed \nin accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal anomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple organ system anomalies ; and \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies ; and \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a fetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline . \n \nThe guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or neurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and \ncomprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)  \nIn a 2022 evidence- based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology. The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing, followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider \nin the context of appropriate pre-  and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n \nThis section is to be used for informational purposes only.

In the brain, the FMR1 gene is responsible for producing a protein essential for development of \nconnections of the nerve cells . Alterations , or mutations, in the genetic material of the FMR1 gene can \nresult in disorders such as Fragile X syndrome, premature ovarian insufficiency, and the neurologic \ndisease Fragile X -associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).  FXTAS  primarily affects men over the \nage of 50 and is associ ated with signs and symptoms including tremor, ataxia, and dementia.  \n \nFragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and the most common \ncause of autism linked to a single gene. Associated with physical, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities, \nFragile X syndrome has an X -linked dominant inheritance pattern. Female offspring inherit an X \nchromosome from each parent, whereas male offspring always inherit the X chromosome from their \nmother and the Y chromosome from their father. This means that the FMR1 gene is inherited by females \nfrom their mother or father and  by males from their mother only. Prevalence and symptoms of Fragile X \nsyndrome in females are often milder than in males because with two X chromosomes, one X \nchromosome may compensate for the other with the mutation.  \nIn these conditions, the pattern of the building blocks of the FMR1 gene, or trinucleotides, are altered  by \nan increased repeat of patterns of nucleotides cytosine -guanine -guanine ( CGG ) on the FMR1 gene. \nDependent upon the degree of increased CGG repeats, the mutation is referred to as eithe r a premutation \nor a full mutation , and can change  over generations by inheritance. Clinical signs and symptoms of \nFragile X syndrome present with full mutation of the CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene while clinical presentation of FXTAS or premature ovarian i nsufficiency may develop in individuals with the FMR1 \nCGG premutation.  \n• Normal 5 -44 CGG repeats . \nPremutation 55- 200 CGG repeats means they carry the unstable mutation and can expand in future \ngenerations.  \nFull mutation > 200 CGG repeats  \n\nPage 2 of 4  Disclaimer____________________________________________________________________ \n \nCoverage is limited to that outlined in Medicaid Rule  or Health Care Administrative Rules that pertains to \nthe member’s  aid category.

There are two different CMA platforms currently being used in the diagnostic setting to detect microdeletions and microduplications; array comparative genomi c \nhybridization (aCGH) and single nucleotide variant  (SNV) arrays , also known as single \nnucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  arrays. CMA increases the diagnostic yield over karyotyping in \nthis population and may impact clinical management decisions.  \nDEVELOPMENTAL DELAY/INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY  \nDevelopmental delay (DD) is diagnosed in children aged five years or younger who show \nsignificant delay in two  or more developmental domains: gross or fine motor, speech/language, \ncognitive, social/personal, and activities of daily living.\n[1] DD can precede the development of \nintellectual disability (ID)  as the child ages.[2] \nID is manifest by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. It is \ndiagnosed at or after age five  (when intelligence testing is considered valid and reliable) but \nprior to age 18 and is lifelong. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fifth Edition (DSM -5) defines ID as occurring during the developmental period and involving \nimpairments of general mental abilities (e.g. , IQ <70 or 75) that impact adaptive functioning in \nthe conceptual, social, and practical domains.\n[3] \nPrevalence estimates of GDD and ID range from 1% to 3%.[4] Both are influenced by genetic, \nenvironmental, infectious, and perinatal factors. Approximately 450 genes have been causally related to ID; most genes (  approximately 90%) are associated with syndromes.\n[5] Inheritance \nof ID can be autosomal dominant, recessive, or X -linked; and most nonsyndromic genes are \nlocated on the X chromosome. Prior to the advent of whole exome and genome sequencing, Willemsen and Kleefstra (2014) concluded that 20% to 40% of ID cases could be attributed to a genetic variant.\n[6] With use of whole genome sequencing, they estimated almost 60% of \ncases have an identifiable genetic etiology.  \nCongenital anomalies are frequently present in children with GDD and ID. In addition, a suspected etiology can often be established from history and physical examination (in as much as 20% to 40% of cases) without genetic testing.\n[7] The recommended approach to evaluation \nin GDD/ID begins with a three- generation family history and physical (including neurologic) \nexam. Subsequent testing is used to confirm a suspected diagnosis (e.g. , targeted testing for \nDiGeorge or cri -du-chat syndromes). If no diagnosis is suspected, fragile X syndrome testing, \nmetabolic testing for inborn errors of metabolism, and chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing (without karyotyping) are recommended—regardles s of the presence or absence of \ndysmorphologic features or congenital anomalies.\n[1] \nAUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER \nDSM -5 defines autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as the presence of:[3] \n• Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple \ncontexts,  \n• Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities,  \n• Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (typically recognized in \n\nGT58 | 4 the first two  years of life), and  \n• Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other \nimportant areas of current functioning.  \nIn 2010, the estimated prevalence of ASD among eight -year-olds was 14.7 per 1000 or 1 in \n68.[8] ASD is four  to five times more common in boys than girls, and white children are more \noften identified with ASD than black or Hispanic children. An accurate diagnosis can generally be made by age two . Evaluation includes developmental screening and diagnostic evaluation \n(i.e., hearing, vision, neurologic, laboratory testing for metabolic disorders, and genetic \ntesting).  \nA large body of evidence supports a genetic etiology in ASD. Twin studies estimate heritability between 60% and 90%.\n[9] A family with an affected child has a 13% to 19% risk for recurrence \nin subsequent children.[10] Based on Swedish genetic studies, Gaugler (2014) concluded that \n“the bulk of autism arises from genetic variation” (as opposed to environmental causes).[11] \nStill, although genetic determinants can be heritable, most appear to arise de novo.[9] For these \nreasons, a child with ASD is often evaluated with genetic testing.  \nDIAGNOSTIC TESTING  \nKaryotyping and Fluorescence I n Situ Hybridization   \nThe goal of a cytogenetic evaluation is to identify chromosomal imbalances that cause a \ndisorder. The most common imbalances are copy number variants (CNVs) or deletions and duplications of large segments of genomic material. CNVs are common in DD/ID and ASD but more often reflect normal genetic variation.\n[12] However, de novo CNVs are observed about \nfour times more frequently in children with ASD than in normal individuals.[9] Less frequently, \nother abnormalities such as balanced translocations (i .e., exchanges of equally sized DNA loci \nbetween chromosomes) may be pathogenic. For many well -described syndromes, the type \nand location of the associated chromosomal abnormality have been established by studying large patient samples. For others, few patients with similar abnormalities may have been evaluated to establish genotype- phenotype correlation. Finally, in some patients, cytogenetic \nanalysis will discover chromosomal abnormalities that require study to determine their significance.  \nPrior to the advent of CMAs, the initial step in cytogenetic analysis was G -banded karyotyping, \nwhich evaluates all chromosomes. High- resolution G -banding can detect changes as small as \nthree to five megabases (Mb) in size, although standard G -banding evaluates more than 10-\nMb changes. In children with DD/ID, a review by Stankiewicz and Beaudet (2007) found G -\nbanded karyotyping diagnostic in approximately 3% to 5%.\n[13] In ASD, high -resolution \nkaryotyping appears to identify abnormalities in up to 5% of cases .[14]  \nIn contrast, molecular cytogenetic techniques can detect small submicroscopic chromosomal alterations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) , a targeted approach, is used to identify \nspecific chromosomal abnormalities associated with suspected diagnoses such as DiGeorge syndrome. Prior to CMAs, FISH was also used to screen the rearrangement -prone \nsubtelomeric regions. Subtelomeric FISH was found to identify abnormalities in children with DD and ID,\n[15] diagnostic in approximately 5% to 6% of those with negative karyotypes, but \nuncommonly in ASD.[16]  \nChromosomal Microarrays  \n\nGT58 | 5 Two types of CMAs are considered here: array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) \nand single nucleotide variants (SNV) arrays. The aCGH approach uses DNA samples from a patient and a normal control. Each is labeled with distinct fluorescent dyes (red or green). The labeled samples are then mixed and hybridized to thousands of cloned or synthesized reference (normal) DNA fragments of known genomic locus immobilized on a glass slide (microarray) to conduct thousands of comparative reactions simultaneously. CNVs are determined by computer analysis of  the array patterns and intensities of the hybridization \nsignals. If the patient sequence is missing part of the normal sequence (a deletion) or has the normal sequence plus additional genomic material within that genomic location (e.g. , a \nduplication), the sequence imbalance is detected as a difference in fluorescence intensity. For this reason, aCGH cannot detect balanced chromosomal translations (equal exchange of material between chromosomes) or sequence inversions (same sequence is present in reverse base pair order) because the fluorescence intensity would not change. A portion of the increased diagnostic yield from CMA over karyotyping comes from the discovery that chromosomal rearrangements  that appear balanced (and therefore not pathogenic) by G -\nbanded karyotype analysis are found to have small imbalances with greater resolution. It has been estimated that 40% of apparently balanced de novo or inherited translocations with abnormal phenotype are associated with cryptic deletion if analyzed by CMA testing.  \nLike aCGH, SNV arrays detect CNVs. In an SNV array, the two  alleles for genes of interest are \ntagged with different florescent dyes. Comparative florescence intensity will be increased when there are duplications and diminished with deletions. The resolution provided by aCGH is higher than that with SNV arrays. In addition, aCGH has better signal -to-background \ncharacteristics than SNV arrays. In contrast to aCGH, SNV arrays will also identify long stretches of DNA homozygosity, which may suggest uniparental  disomy (UPD) or \nconsanguinity. UPD occurs when a child inherits two  copies of a chromosome from one parent \nand no copies from the other parent. UPD can lead to syndromes such as Angelman and Prader -Willi.  \nMicroarrays may be prepared by the laboratory using the technology or, more commonly, by commercial manufacturers, and sold to laboratories that must qualify and validate the product for use in their assay, in conjunction with computerized software for interpretation. The proliferation of laboratory -developed and commercially available platforms prompted the \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) to publish guidelines for the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software in the postnatal setting.\n[17] \nGENETIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH DD/ID AND ASD \nFor common phenotypes and syndromes, the pathogenicity of CNVs may be supported by considerable evidence; for uncommon phenotypes and uncommon CNVs determining pathogenicity requires a systematic evaluation that includes parental studies, examining databas es for reported associations, and considering the molecular consequences of the \nidentified variant. Parental studies (e.g. , “trio” testing of affected child, father, and mother) can \nidentify an inherited CNV from an unaffected parent and therefore consider ed benign.\n[18] A \nvariety of databases index the clinical implications of CNVs their associations with a particular phenotype. CNVs are continuously cataloged and, with growth in CMA testing and improved resolution, databases have become increasingly extensive (e.g. , DECIPHER, ClinVar). For \nuncommon CNVs, in addition to reports of CNV -phenotype associations, the location and size \nof the CNV can offer clues to pathogenicity; larger CNVs are more often pathogenic and the \n\nGT58 | 6 role of affected genes in brain circuitry and effect of CNV on gene expression can implicate \npathogenicity. Although uncommon, an observed phenotype can result from unmasking a mutated recessive allele on the unaffected (non- CNV) chromosome.\n[19] Other considerations \nwhen determining pathogenicity include CNV dosage, X linkage, number of reports in the literature of association between CNV and phenotype, and findings in “normal” individuals.   \nThe ACMG has published guidelines for evaluating, interpreting, and reporting pathogenicity \nreflecting these principles.\n[20] The recommended categories of clinical significance for reporting \nare: pathogenic, uncertain clinical significance (likely pathogenic, likely benign, or no \nsubclassification), or benign. The International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays Consortium \nmore recently proposed “an evidence- based approach to guide the development of content on \nchromosomal microarrays and to support interpretation of clinically significant copy number variation.”\n[21] The proposal defined levels of evidence that describe how well or how poorly \ndetected variants or CNVs correlate with phenotype.  \nREGULATORY STATUS  \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in- house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory -developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments. Lab tests for CMA testing are available under the \nauspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that offer laboratory -\ndeveloped tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high- complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not \nto require any regulatory review of these tests, though some have received marketing \nclearance.  \nCOMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TESTS  \nCMA testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole- genome arrays, with or without SNV analysis. Some of these tests are described below.  \nGeneDx’s GenomeDx is a whole genome array intended for postnatal cases. It also contains  \nSNV probes and also targets at the exon level 65 genes associated with neurodevelopmental \ndisorders.  \nIn 2014 the FDA cleared the Affymetrix CytoScan® Dx Assay  for marketing  through its de novo \n501(k) classification process. T he FDA’s review of the CytoScan® Dx Assay included an \nanalytical evaluation of the test’s ability to accurately detect numerous chromosomal variations of different types, sizes, and genome locations when compared to several analytically validated test methods. The FDA found that the CytoScan ® Dx Assay could analyze a \npatient’s entire genome and adequately detect chromosome variations in regions of the genome associated with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  As of July 2017, Affymetrix \nreported 2.69 million markers for copy number, 750,000 biallelic probes, and 1.9 million polymorphic probes . Affymetrix ™ was acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific in 2016. \nFirstStep\nDx PLUS ® uses Lineagen’s custom -designed microarray platform manufactured by \nAffymetrix. As of July 2017, this microarray consists of a 2.8 million probe microarray for the \ndetection of CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. The array includes  probes \nthat come standard on the Affymetrix CytoScan HD® microarray, with an additional 88,4 35 \ncustom probes designed by Lineagen. FirstStepDx PLUS® is an integrated service that \ncombines proprietary genetic testing, reporting, and genetic counseling.  \n\nGT58 | 7 Ambry Genetics offers a 180K oligo array and a combined SNV + CGH array and states that \nthe tests should be considered for all individuals with syndromic or non- syndromic conditions \nthat may be caused by genomic imbalance. As of July 2017, the CMA offered by Ambry \nGenetics includes over 2.6 million probes for copy number and 750,000 SNV probes.  \nLabCorp offers the Reveal SNP M icroarray -Pediatric and states that the test is intended for \nindividuals with non- syndromic congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, DD, mental \nretardation, ID and/or ASD.  The Reveal microarray has 2, 695 million probes as of July 2017.  \nEVIDENCE SUMMARY  \nHuman Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature[22] is used to describe variants found \nin DNA and serves as an international standard. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017. According to this nomenclature, the term “variant” is used to describe a change in a DNA or protein sequence, replacing previously -used \nterms, such as “mutation.” Pathogenic variants are variants associated with disease, while benign variants are not. The majority of genetic changes have unknown effects on human health, and these are referred to as variants of uncertain significance.  \nValidation of the clinical use of any genetic test focuses on three main principles:  \n1. Analytic validity, which refers to the technical accuracy of the test in detecting a variant  \nthat is present or in excluding a variant that is absent;  \n2. Clinical validity, which refers to the diagnostic performance of the test (i.e., sensitivity,  \nspecificity, positive and negative predictive values) in detecting clinical disease; and \n3. Clinical utility, which refers to how the results of the diagnostic test will be used to change disease management and whether these changes in management lead to clinically important improvements in health outcomes.  \nThe 2015 BCBSA TEC Special Report on CMA for global DD, ID, and ASD reviewed the evidence for the analytic validity of CMA testing, and made the following conclusions: “In \nsummary, acceptable analytic validity is generally assumed for CMA testing based on \nlaboratories meeting quality standards under CLIA, including participation in proficiency testing. Reports of analytic validity specific to CMA are not readily identified. Data supporting the analytic validity of the CytoScan Dx® Assay for use in children with ID and GDD were \nincluded as part of the FDA clearance.”\n[23] The following evidence review is focused on clinical \nvalidity and utility.  \nCMA FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY/INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES IN CHILDREN AND \nADOLESCENTS \nClinical validity  \nThere is sufficient evidence of the clinical validity of CMA testing for children and adolescents \nfor the evaluation of developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder and congenital anomalies. This evidence consists of large case series and cohort studies testing between 200 and 15,000 patients with CMA. The diagnosis rates reported in these large studies ranges from 5% to 26%, depending on the study and the indication.\n[24-35] Although few \n\nGT58 | 8 studies report VUS rates, the more recent studies report VUS rates within the same range as \nCNVs determined to be pathogenic (9% to 20%).  \nClinical Utility  \nNeither standard cytogenetic analysis nor CMA analysis have been systematically studied for impact on clinical outcomes other than diagnosis\n[36, 37]; Schaefer and Mendelsohn[16] \nacknowledge, for example, that a genetic diagnosis “typically will not change interventions for the [autism] patient.” Rather, clinical utility of genetic testing is primarily inferred based on the value of diagnosis to the family, estimation of recurrence risk, and on the importance of early detection and early intervention.\n[37]  \nGuidelines emphasize the importance of cytogenetic evaluation to look for certain kinds of \nvariant s that may be linked to specific conditions for early diagnosis and intervention. However, \nthe benefits of early intervention for these disorders are uncertain. Few randomized trials have been conducted and the interventions differ considerably, indicating that the field is still early in \nresearching the critical elements of effective early intervention. For well -characterized genetic \nsyndromes, it is important  to incorporate monitoring for co- morbidities known to be associated \nwith the condition. For example, 22q11 microdeletion syndrome (includes D iGeorge and \nvelocardiofacial syndromes) is associated with development of hearing impairment in a significant proportion of patients, with subsequent delayed speech.\n[38] Velocardiofacial \nsyndrome is also associated with heart defects.[3] Klinefelter syndrome may first be detected as \ndevelopmental delay in early childhood; androgen treatment is an important component of therapy.\n[3] \nA reasonable body of literature has evaluated whether the establishment of a definitive diagnosis in patients with DD/ID, ASD, and/or congenital anomalies leads to changes in management that are likely to improve outcomes. Of particular interest in the use of CMA \ntesting to make a specific genetic diagnosis in a patient with DD/ID, ASD, and/or congenital anomalies is the effect of that diagnosis on the patient’s family. Because many affected patients will be evaluated for testing in childhood, the implications of testing on family members and the reciprocal effect on the patient are considerations.  \nSeveral retrospective studies have been published that examined the potential impact of CMA \nresults on clinical decisions, including referral to other specialists and further evaluations for  associated symptoms.\n[39-44] Additional clinical action was taken based on CMA result between \n45% to 80% of the time, depending on the study and the indication diagnosed. These studies collectively indicate that identified pathogenic variants can prompt clinical actions potentially impacting morbidity. Less clear is how often outcomes will be improved and in which cases interventions might have occurred in the absence of testing. The proportion that may  benefit \nwill depend on the variants identified as well as diagnostic yield, which in turn depends on phenotype severity. Studies did not report on any follow -up or management changes in \npatients without identified pathogenic variants. In addition to reducing morbidity, bringing closure to a diagnostic odyssey is a reason for genetic testing cited by parents and noted as an outcome in case series and reports.\n[45] Saam (2008) noted that CMA testing may influence \nthat odyssey.[43] Parents cite obtaining services and support as a reason for testing, but how \nthe frequency can impact outcomes is difficult to quantify. The studies reviewed convey a set \nof intermediate outcomes likely to favorably affect the health of some children. Lacking are \nend-to-end studies following children at presentation to final outcomes. In addition to these \nstudies, Lingen (2016) has reported a benefit for maternal quality of life if aCGH tests succeed \n\nGT58 | 9 to clarify the etiologic diagnosis in an affected child.[46] \nSection Summary \nChromosomal microarray (CMA) testing has been proposed for detection of genetic \nimbalances in patients  with characteristics of developmental delay/intellectual disability \n(DD/ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and/or congenital anomalies.  Although systematic \nstudies of the impact of CMA on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been well -demonstrated, and, for at least a subset of the disorders \npotentially diagnosed with CMA testing in this patient population, there are well -defined and \naccepted management steps associated with positive test results . Thus, there is sufficient \nevidence of the analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility of CMA testing for children and adolescents for the evaluation of developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder and congenital anomalies, and the scientific evidence will no longer be \nreviewed for CMA testing for children and adolescents for the evaluation of these indications . \nCMA TESTING IN ADULTS \nClinical Validity  \nHo (2016)  published a study on the clinical performance of an ultrahigh- resolution \nchromosomal microarray optimized for neurodevelopmental disorders, including \ndevelopmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), on a series of 5, 487 patients over 3.5 years.\n[47] A subset of 225 patients was comprised of adults \nover 18 years old, which were analyzed separately from the pediatric patients. In patients where the indication for testing was either ID (n=119) or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA) (n=35), the rate of pathogenic CNVs in adult patients tested were the highest of any age group, similar at levels similar to the first year of life: (16.8% and 20.0%, resp.). The authors note that this could be due to the relatively small size of this cohort, or alternatively,  it may be more \nreflective of severity in that particular age group. The VUS rate in adults with ID was higher than any other age group analyzed (21.8%), but lower in adults with MCG (14.8%).  \nCostain (2013)  used high- resolution genome -wide microarrays to investigate rare CNVs in a \nprospectively recruited community -based cohort of 459 unrelated adults with schizophrenia.\n[48] \nA blinded review by two independent clinical cytogenetic laboratory directors of all large (>500 kb) rare CNVs in cases and well -matched controls showed that those deemed to be clinically \nsignificant were highly enriched in schizophrenia (16.4- fold increase, p<0.0001). In this cohort, \n23 of the 459 adult patients (5.0%) were found to have a pathogenic rare CNV. The investigators state that their findings suggest consideration of a potential role for clinical microarray testing in schizophrenia and that potential aspects of clinical utility of such testing might include a potential etiological explanation for a patient’s condition and reproductive implications for siblings and patients themselves.  \nREPRODUCTIVE DECISION MAKING  \nRisk estimates for recurrence of disease in future births can be altered considerably by information from the genetic diagnosis. For example, the average sibling recurrence risk in ASDs is 5% .\n[3] However, in the case of a dominant single -gene disorder with full penetrance, \nwhen a parent is known to carry the pathogenic variant  parent, the risk to a future child is  50%. \nIf the disorder is recessive, the sibling risk is 25%. For an x -linked disorder, such as  fragile X \nsyndrome, the recurrence risk in a brother is 50%, while a sister may be only mildly affected \n\nGT58 | 10 but will have a carrier risk of up to 50%. In contrast, if the disorder is the result of a de novo \nCNV (i.e., not carried by either parent), the sibling risk remains low, at the population average.  \nKnowledge of recurrence risk is expected to lead to improved quality of life and impact future \nreproductive decision- making in families affected by  DD/ID or ASD associated with specific \nvariant s. Several family studies have reported on such measures generally reporting positive \nresults on subjective outcomes assessed.[43, 46, 49, 50] \nPRACTICE GUIDELINE SUMMARY \nAMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS  \nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics  (AAP)  Committee on Genetics published a \nclinical report to outline a medical genetic evaluation of children with intellectual disability or global developmental delay.\n[1] The committee’s is as follows:  \n1. If a specific diagnosis is suspected, arrange for the appropriate diagnostic studies to confirm including single- gene tests or chromosomal microarray test.  \n2. If diagnosis is unknown and no clinical diagnosis is strongly suspected, begin the stepwise evaluation process:  \na. CMA should be performed in all.  \nb. Metabolic testing should be considered and should include serum total homocysteine, acyl -carnitine profile, amino acids; and urine organic acids, \nglycosaminoglycans, oligosaccharides, purines, pyrimidines, guanidinoacetate/creatine metabolites.  \nc. Fragile X testing should be performed in all.  \n3. If no diagnosis is established:  \na. Male gender and family history suggestive X -linkage, complete XLID panel that \ncontains genes causal of nonsyndromic XLID and complete high- density X -CMA. \nConsider X -inactivation skewing in the mother of the proband.  \nb. Female gender: complete MECP2 deletion, duplication, and sequencing study.   \nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.\n[51] The report proposed a \nscreening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that a \"child with suspected global developmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further testing may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"  \nAlso in 2020, the AAP published a clinical report on the identification, evaluation, and \nmanagement of children with autism spectrum disorder  which states the following regarding \nCMA:\n[52] \n“CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. CMA \nidentifies copy number variants (CNVs) at this time, which are DNA duplications or \n\nGT58 | 11 deletions that alter the function of genes. CMA reveals a definitively pathogenic CNV in \n5.4% to 14% (median 9%) of individuals with ASD in clinical samples. When CNVs of uncertain significance are included, approximately 17% to 42% of patients with ASD have findings on the CMA. Some of the variants of uncertain significance may be determined as pathogenic in the future. ” \nAMERICAN ACADEMY OF NEUROLOGY AND THE PRACTICE COMMITTEE OF THE CHILD NEUROLOGY SOCIETY  \nThe American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child Neurology Society Evidence Report concludes that “microarray is the genetic test with the highest diagnostic yield in children with unexplained DD/ID” (based on Class III studies).\n[4] In addition, \nthe report notes that microarray testing can identify only CNVs and is insufficiently sensitive for detecting disorders caused by other mechanisms (e.g., inversions, balanced insertions, polyploidy etc.). Finally, per the report, the often complex results of this testing require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist.\n[4] The \nguidelines acknowledge that “Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an accurate etiologic diagnosis.”  \nAMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL GENETICS AND GENOMICS \nIn 2011, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published \nguidelines on array -based technologies and their clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal \nabnormalities.\n[53] This was reaffirmed in 2020.[54] The recommendations are based on a limited \nreview of evidence and the findings are from a handful of publications are reported. However, study selection criteria are not included and included publications are not critically appraised. Per the guidelines, CMA testing for copy number variation is recommended as a first -line test \nin the initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:  \no Multiple anomalies not specific to a well -delineated genetic syndrome  \no Apparently non- syndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability  \no Autism spectrum disorders  \nThe guideline warns that the clinicians need to be aware of the “different clinical platforms, the variation in resolution among arrays and information each provides.” Also, the guideline notes the limitations of CMA testing (e.g., cannot identify balanced chromosomal rearrangements \nsuch as translocations or inversions). Additional ACMG guidelines have been published for the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software\n[17] and \nfor the interpretation and reporting of CNVs,[20] both intended for the post -natal setting.  \nIn 2013 ACMG published guidelines on the genetic evaluation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), stating that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the recommendation being for first tier to include FXS and CMA, and second tier to include MECP2 and PTEN testing.\n[55] The guideline states that “this \napproach will evolve with continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been reported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of evaluation is a distinct possibility. Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively, advances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform”.  \n\nGT58 | 12 INTERNATIONAL STANDARD CYTOGENOMIC ARRAY CONSORTIUM  \nThe International Standard Cytogenomic Array (ISCA) Consortium published a consensus \nstatement in which they recommend offering CMA as the first- tier genetic test, in place of G -\nbanded karyotype, for patients with unexplained DD/ID, ASDs, or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA).\n[56] However, the guideline also acknowledges that CMA is still not widely \naccepted. “Except in special cases, such as those involving family history of multiple miscarriages, a karyotype is not cost effective in a child with DD/ID, ASDs, or MCA and a negative array study. CMA testing is not inexpensive, but the cost is less than the cost of a G -\nbanded karyotype plus a customized FISH test such as subtelomeric FISH, and the yield is greater.”  \nSUMMARY  \nResearch showing that  chromosomal microarray (CMA)  or copy number  testing  can improve \nhealth outcomes for patients  is limited . However, for certain disorders, CMA test results may \nprovide a diagnosis that leads to changes in medical management and can inform reproductive decision making. In addition, clinical practice guidelines recommend CMA \ntesting for certain groups of patients. Therefore, CMA  and copy number testing may be \nconsidered medically necessary in individuals with a pparent nonsyndromic cognitiv e \ndevelopmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or m ultiple \ncongenital anomalies .  \nMost research on chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing  has included patients with \napparent nonsyndromic cognitive developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism \nspectrum disorder , and/or multiple congenital anomalies . There is not enough research to \nshow that CMA or copy number testing can improve health outcomes in patients who do not have these disorders, including testing of  asymptomatic relatives of patients with abnormal \nCMA findings. Therefore, CMA or copy number testing is considered investigational when \npolicy criteria are not met.  \nREFERENCES  \n 1. Moeschler JB, Shevell M.

Intellectual disability (ID, formerly \nreferred to as mental retardation) is \"a disability characterized by significant limitations \nin both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, \nsocial and practical adaptive skills.\"1 Global developmental delay (GDD) categorizes \nyounger children (typically less than 5 years of age) who have significant delay \n(characterized as performance two standard deviations or more below the mean on \nage-appropriate, standardized, normal-referenced testing) in two or more \ndevelopmental domains, including gross or fine motor, speech and language, cognitive,\nsocial and personal, and activities of daily living.2 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 7 of 17\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Autism                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nIncidence \nASD affects approximately 1/54 children.3 ID affects 1-3% of the population worldwide.2\nThe incidence of GDD is estimated to be comparable to ID.1,4 All three \nneurodevelopmental disorders are more common in males.2,4-7 \nSymptoms \nASD was previously divided into categories that included autistic disorder, Asperger's \ndisorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder- not \notherwise specified (PDD-NOS). With current diagnostic criteria, these categories were\nsubsumed under the diagnosis of ASD.\nSymptom onset is in early childhood (typically before 3 years of age).6,7 ASD is often \naccompanied by intellectual disability, behavioral difficulties, and/or sensory \nabnormalities. \nID and GDD may present in infancy or early childhood. ID is assessed in three \ndomains: intelligence (IQ), adaptive behavior, and systems of supports the individual \nrequires.1 Children with GDD have significant delay in two or more developmental \ndomains. Young children with GDD may later be diagnosed with ID and/or ASD.2,4 \nThere are both syndromic and non-syndromic forms of inherited ASD, ID, and GDD. \nThe constellation of associated findings is highly dependent on the underlying etiology. \nClinical information (e.g. presence of specific congenital malformations, dysmorphic \nfeatures, and other symptoms) may be used in some cases to help narrow down the \nsuspected cause. In these cases, it may be possible to identify a narrow subset of \ngenes that may be responsible for an individual's neurodevelopmental concerns.\nCause \nASD, ID, and GDD can develop secondary to head injury, birth complication, endocrine\ndisorder (e.g., hypothyroidism), toxic exposure (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome), inborn \nerror of metabolism (e.g., phenylketonuria), and central nervous system infection.2,6,7 \nThere are also many known genetic conditions that are associated with an increased \nrisk for ASD, ID, and GDD. A thorough clinical genetics evaluation is estimated to result\nin an identified cause in 30–40% of affected individuals with ASD.6 Chromosome \nmicroarray analysis was previously thought to have the highest diagnostic yield of any \nsingle test for these disorders, with an estimated detection rate of at least 10-20% for \nASD, ID, and GDD (often grouped together as neurodevelopmental disorders, or \nNDDs).4,6,8,9 Whole exome and genome sequencing have more recently been \ndemonstrated to have diagnostic yields of up to 35% for those with NDDs and \npotentially higher for those with other comorbidities such as epilepsy or congenital \nanomalies.9 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 8 of 17\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Autism                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nInheritance \nInheritance patterns differ between the various syndromes associated with ASD, ID, \nGDD. Inherited forms of these disorders can show autosomal dominant, autosomal \nrecessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial patterns of inheritance. \nDiagnosis \nASD, ID, and GDD are diagnosed through the evaluation of an individual's \ndevelopment and behaviors by an appropriate specialist (such as neurodevelopmental \npediatrician or developmental-behavioral pediatrician). Medical tests such as hearing \nscreening, vision screening, and neurological evaluations may also be performed.2,5 A \ndiagnosis of ASD and/or ID is often difficult to establish in infants and very young \nchildren, as the standardized methods used for diagnosis are less reliable in children \nunder the age of 5 years; the term \"global developmental delay\" is thus used to \ncategorize these individuals.2 Identifying an underlying genetic etiology for an \nindividual's NDD cannot provide a diagnosis of ASD versus ID versus a specific \nlearning disability.\nManagement \nManagement for ASD includes behavioral interventions such as applied behavioral \nanalysis (ABA) therapy, structured educational interventions, and in some cases, \npharmacotherapy.6,7 NDDs are also managed with therapies and educational \nintervention plans tailored to the individual's needs. In a limited number of cases \n(mostly metabolic disorders), knowing the genetic mutation that is responsible for a \nneurodevelopmental disorder can help to guide management. Identifying a genetic \nsyndrome may also alert the healthcare team to potential comorbidities for which \nevaluation and surveillance may be needed.\nSurvival \nWhile life expectancy in autism may be reported as reduced, this is often secondary to \naccidents such as drowning.3 With the exception of individuals with multiple disabilities \n(such as Down syndrome), the life expectancy of individuals with intellectual disability \nis now similar to that of the general population.10 Comorbid conditions can also affect \nsurvival in these disorders.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nTesting for ASD, ID, and GDD may include known familial mutation analysis, single \ngene sequence analysis, single gene deletion/duplication analysis, or multi-gene \npanels of various sizes. \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 9 of 17\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Autism                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nKnown Familial Mutation (KFM) Testing \nKnown familial mutations analysis is performed when a causative mutation has been \nidentified in a close biological relative of the individual requesting testing. Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis. These assays detect gains and losses too large to be \nidentified through standard sequence analysis, often single or multiple exons or whole \ngenes.\nMulti-Gene Testing Panels \nThe efficiency of NGS has led to an increasing number of large, multi-gene testing \npanels. NGS panels that test several genes at once are particularly well-suited to \nconditions caused by more than one gene or where there is considerable clinical \noverlap between conditions making it difficult to reliably narrow down likely causes. \nAdditionally, tests should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of identifying mutations \nin the genes of interest, contribute to alterations in management for an individual, and/\nor minimize the chance of finding variants of uncertain clinical significance. \nASD, ID and GDD multi-gene panels include a wide variety of genes: from a few to \nhundreds or even thousands. These disorders may also be grouped together in broad \n\"neurodevelopmental\" panels. Multi-gene panels may also include genes believed to \nbe associated with disease (e.g. \"susceptibility\" genes), but with a lower impact on risk \nthan recognized syndromes. Results for such genes are of less clear value because \nthere often are not clear management recommendations for mutation-positive \nindividuals.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Benefit determinations are based in all cases on the applicable contract \nlanguage. To the extent there may be any conflict between the Medical Policy and contract language, the contract \nlanguage takes precedence.  \nPLEASE NOTE: Contracts exclude from coverage, among other things, services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers may bill members for services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers are e ncouraged to inform members before rendering such \nservices that the members are likely to be financially responsible for the cost of these services.  \n \nDESCRIPTION  \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is defined as targeted sequencing of the subset of the human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein- coding DNA.  Whole \ngenome sequencing (WGS) uses next -generation sequencing techniques to sequence both \ncoding- and non- coding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed to be \nmore efficient than traditional sequencing methods in discovering the genetic causes of diseases  and other indications . \nMEDICAL POLICY CRITERIA  \n \nNote:  This policy does not address tumor tissue or cell -free DNA testing for targeted \ntreatment of cancer (see Cross References  section ). \nI. Whole exome sequencing may be considered medically necessary for the evaluation \nof unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in pediatric patients (age 17 \nyears and younger) when all of the following criteria (A. – C.) are met:  \nA. The patient has had a clinical evaluation and has been informed about the \npotential risks of genetic testing; and \nB. There is clinical documentation that  whole exome sequencing results will guide \ndecisions for medical management; and \nC. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the patient’s \n\n\nGT76 | 2 phenotype, and one of the following is met:  \n1. The clinical presentation is not consistent with a well -described genetic \nsyndrome for which targeted genetic testing is available; or  \n2. Previous targeted genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis and whole \nexome sequencing may prevent the need for  invasive procedures as the next \ndiagnostic step (e.g. , muscle biopsy) .  \nII. Whole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic \ndisorders when Criterion I. is not met, including but not limited to prenatal or \npreimplantation testing.  \nIII. Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \nIV. Whole transcriptome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \n \nNOTE: A summary of the supporting rationale for the policy criteria is at the end of the policy.  \nLIST OF INFORMATION NEEDED FOR REVIEW  \nSUBMISSION OF GENETIC TESTING DOCUMENTATION \nAll of the following information must be submitted for review prior to the genetic testing:  \n• Name of genetic test(s)  and/or panel test   \n• Name of performing laboratory and/or genetic testing organization (more than one may \nbe listed)  \n• Date of blood draw or sample collection  \n• Relevant billing codes  \n• Brief description of how the genetic test results will guide clinical decisions that would \nnot otherwise be made in the absence of testing \n• Clinical d ocumentation that the risks of testing have been discussed \nCROSS REFERENCES  \n1.

It is being implemented for genetic testing \nmedical evidence review updates starting in 2017. According to this nomenclature, the term “variant” is used to describe a change in a DNA or protein sequence, repl acing previously \nused terms, such as “mutation.” Pathogenic variants are variants associated with disease, \nwhile benign variants are not. The majority of genetic changes have unknown effects on human health, and these are referred to as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) . \nCurrently available clinical assays designed for the molecular diagnosis of rare Mendelian diseases are incomplete. This is due to genetic heterogeneity, the presence of unknown \ncausative genes, and because only a portion of the known genes and variant s can be \nefficiently tested using conventional molecular methods. Recently, next -generation sequencing \n(NGS)  technologies have become more accessible in terms of cost and speed and have been \nadopted by a growing number of molecular genetic clinical laboratories.  \nDepending on the disorder and the degree of genetic and clinical heterogeneity, the current \ndiagnostic pathway for patients with suspected genetic disorders accompanied by multiple anomalies may depend on various combinations of low -yield radiographic, \nelectrophysiological, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic evaluations.\n[2] The search for a \ndiagnosis may thus become a time- consuming and expensive process. When a disease-\ncausing gene(s) is established, assays based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  technology, \nfor example, can be designed to specifically detect known variant s for clinical diagnosis. When \nmany different single -nucleotide variants (SNVs)  in a gene are possible, Sanger sequencing, \nthe current gold standard for detecting unknown SNVs , can be employed to determine the \nentire sequence of the coding and intron/exon splice sites of gene regions where variant s are \nmost likely to be found. However, when genes are large and variant s are possible in many or \nall exons (protein- coding regions of the gene), and when there is genetic (locus) heterogeneity, \ncomprehensive Sanger sequencing may be prohibitively laborious and costly.  \nWES using NGS technology is a relatively new approach to obtaining a genetic diagnosis in \npatients more efficiently compared with traditional methods. Exome sequencing has the capacity to determine an individual’s exomic variation profile in a single assay. This profile is \nlimited to most of the protein coding sequence of an individual (approximately 85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons, and constitutes approximately 1% of the whole genome. It is believed that the exome contains about 85% of heritable disease- causing \nvariant s. \nPublished studies have show n that exome sequencing can be used to detect previously \nannotated pathogenic variant s and reveal new likely pathogenic variant s in known and \nunknown genes. A limited number of studies have reported that the diagnostic yield of exome \nsequencing  appears to be significantly increased above that of traditional Sanger sequencing, \nwhile  also being faster and more efficien t relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.  \nWGS uses similar techniques to WES but involves the sequencing of noncoding DNA in addition to the protein- coding segments of the genome.  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing involves the use of NGS to sequence RNA molecules instead of DNA.  \nLIMITATIONS OF WES  AND WGS \n\nGT76 | 4 At this time, the limitations of WES  and WGS  include technical and implementation challenges. \nThere are issues of error rates due to uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture prior \nto sequencing, and difficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without losing likely candidate variant s. It is difficult to filter and interpret \npotential causative variants from the large number of variants of unknown significance (VUS)  \ngenerated for each patient. Variant databases are poorly annotated, and algorithms for annotating variants will need to be automated. Existing databases that catalog variants and putative disease associations are known to have significant entry error rates.  \nApproaches for characterizing the functional impact of rare and novel variants (i.e., achieving full-genome clinical interpretations that are scientifically sound and medically relevant) have to \nbe improved. The variability contributed by the different platforms and procedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service is unknown, and detailed guidance from regulatory and professional organizations is still under development. Finally, exome sequencing has some similar limitations as Sanger sequencing and will not \nidentify the following: intronic sequences or gene regulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions, duplications or rearrangements within genes; nucleotide repeats; or epigenetic changes. WGS address some of these limitations but is limited by the need for increased analytic power and the likelihood of greater identification of VUS. \nThere are also ethical questions about reporting incidental findings such as identifying \nmedically relevant variant s in genes unrelated to the diagnostic question, sex chromosome \nabnormalities, and non- paternity when family studies are performed. Standards for the \nrequired components of informed consent before WES/WGS is performed have been proposed and include a description of confidentiality and a description of how incidental findings will be managed.\n[3] Methods of reporting findings from WES/WGS are in development. \nFor example, McLaughlin et al, reporting on the MedSeq Project which is testing methods for evaluating and reporting WES/WGS data, described the development of a genome report that highlights results  that are significant to the indication being evaluated.\n[4] \nRESULTS OF TESTING WITH WES/WGS[5] \n1. A variant known to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• This is a sequence variant that has been shown through prior genetic and clinical research to cause a disease.  \n2. A variant suspected to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• Most variants detected by WES sequencing are uncharacterized and some are \nnovel (i.e., never known to have been observed in a human sample). Some variants \nallow for relatively easy and accurate clinical interpretation; however, for most there is little dat a on which to base an assessment of causality. Tools to facilitate the \nassessment of causality include bioinformatic analyses, predicted structural changes, and others. While these tools may be useful, their predictive power is highly variable. In addition, each clinical laboratory offering WES/WGS testing have their own “in- house” algorithm to facilitate assessment and classification of these \nvariants.  \n\nGT76 | 5 3. A variant of uncertain significance (VOUS/VUS)  is identified.   \n• Among the known 30,000 to 40,000 variants that reside in the protein- coding \nportions of the genome, the typical subject will have three to eight  actionable \nvariants. (Most relate to reproductive risks, i .e., heterozygous carrier alleles.) But the \nremaining thousands are either highly likely to be benign or of uncertain clinical \nsignificance. It can be equally as challenging to prove that a variant is benign as it is to prove it is pathogenic. Currently, nearly all variants among the tens of thousands must b e considered of uncertain significance.   \nAVAILABLE TESTING SERVICES  \nWES  \nExamples of some laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service and their \nindications for testing are summarized in the table below.  \nLaboratory  Laboratory indications for testing \nAmbry Genetics  “The patient's clinical presentation is unclear/atypical disease and there are \nmultiple genetic conditions in the differential diagnosis.”  \nGeneDx  “a patient with a diagnosis that suggests the involvement of one or more of many different genes, which would, if even available and sequenced individually, be prohibitively expensive”  \nBaylor College of Medicine “used when a patient’s medical history and physical exam findings strongly \nsuggest that there is an underlying genetic etiology. In some cases, the \npatient may have had an extensive evaluation consisting of multiple genetic tests, without identifying an etiology.” Baylor also offers a prenatal WES \ntest. \nUniversity of California Los Angeles Health System  “This test is intended for use in conjunction with the clinical presentation and other markers of disease progression for the management of patients with rare genetic disorders.”  \nEdgeBio Recommended “In situations where there has been a diagnostic failure with no discernible path . . . In situations where there are currently no available \ntests to determine the status of a potential genetic disease . . . In situations \nwith atypical findings  indicative of multiple disease[s]”  \nChildren’s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics  Provided as a service to families with children who have had an extensive negative work -up for a genetic disease; also used to identify novel disease \ngenes.  \nEmory Genetics Laboratory  “Indicated when there is a suspicion of a genetic etiology contributing to the proband’s manifestations.”  \nKnight Diagnostic Laboratory  “diagnosing rare hereditary diseases, inconclusive results from targeted panel tests, presentation of multiple phenotypes or when a patient presents an unknown or novel phenotype.”  \nWGS  \nAlthough WGS has been used as a research tool, it is less well -developed as a clinical service. \nSeveral laboratories offer WGS as a clinical service. \n\nGT76 | 6 Transcriptome Sequencing  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing is primarily used as a research tool, but several labs now \noffer such testing for clinical purposes.  \nREGULATORY STATUS  \nNo U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -cleared genotyping tests were found. Thus, \ngenotyping is offered as a laboratory -developed test. Clinical laboratories may develop and \nvalidate tests in- house (“home- brew”) and market them as a laboratory service.  Such tests \nmust meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). \nThe laboratory offering the service must be licensed by CLIA for high- complexity testing.  \nEVIDENCE SUMMARY  \nValidation of the clinical use of any genetic test focuses on three main principles:  \n1. The analytic validity of the test, which refers to the technical accuracy of the test in detecting a variant  that is present or in excluding a variant  that is absent;  \n2. The clinical validity of the test, which refers to the diagnostic performance of the test (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) in detecting clinical disease; and  \n3. The clinical utility of the test, i.e., how the results of the diagnostic test will be used to change management of the patient and whether these changes in management lead to clinically important improvements in health outcomes.  \nThe focus of the literature search was on evidence related to the ability of genetic test results to: \n• Guide decisions in the clinical setting related to either treatment, management, or prevention, and  \n• Improve health outcomes as a result of those decisions.  \nWHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING (WES)  \nThe clinical validity  of WES is related to the diagnostic performance of this technology, while \nthe clinical utility lies in the influence of the results on medical decision making and patient outcomes. For  clinical utility to be established, evidence would be needed of the ability of WES \nto provide the following improvements over other testing methods:  \n• Ability to establish a definitive diagnosis by detection of additional variant s not found by \nother testing methods and leading to management changes that improve outcomes and/or eliminate the need for additional testing   \n• Equivalent or superior accuracy attained with superior efficiency of workup (e.g., diagnosis obtained more quickly) compared with other methods of sequencing.  \nTechnology Assessments \nA 2013 BlueCross BlueShield Association Technology Evaluation Center (TEC) Special Report \non WES in patients with suspected genetic disorders, found no published studies that systematically examined potential outcomes of interest such as changes in medical  \nmanagement (including revision of initial diagnoses), and changes in reproductive decision \n\nGT76 | 7 making after a diagnosis of a Mendelian disorder by WES.[6] The evidence was limited to a \nsmall number of studies of patient series and a larger number of very small series or family \nstudies that reported anecdotal examples of medical management and reproductive decision-making outcomes of exome sequencing in patients who were not diagnosed by traditional methods. These studies showed that, over and above traditional molecular and conventional diagnostic testing, exome sequencing could lead to a diagnosis that influenced patient care and/or reproductive decisions but gave no indication of the proportion of patients for which this was true. The report noted that publication of a large number of small diagnostic studies with positive results but few with negative results raise the possibility of publication bias, the impact of which is unknown.  \nIn 2020, the Washington State Health Care Authority released a technology assessment of \nWES.\n[7] Information on the diagnostic yield of WES was calculated using data from 99 studies. \nThe overall pooled estimate for this was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.7% to 40.6%), \nwhile the pooled yield for gene panels and traditional testing pathways were 27% (95% CI 13.7% to 40.5%) and 21% (95% CI 5.6% to 36.4%), respectively.  The diagnostic yield \ngenerally decreased with increasing patient age. The clinical utility of WES was assessed based on data from 30 studies, most of which were single- arm observational cohort studies. \nThe key findings from this assessment were:  \n• “Among studies that enrolled patients with diverse phenotypes (18 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 12% to 100%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 5% to 25%  \no A WES diagnosis resulted in counseling and genetic testing for family members for between 4% and 97%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with epilepsy (5 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 0% to 31%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 0% to 20%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with a single phenotype (7 studies), all reported some changes in clinical management following a WES diagnosis, but the data was too heterogenous to synthesize into a single range.”  \nThe certainty of the evidence related to clinical utility was rated as very low due to study limitations including study design, inconsistency, and imprecision. Evidence related to health outcomes could not be evaluated due to the substantial limitations in study design and outcome reporting among the seven studies that reported these outcomes.  \nWES f\nor Children with Multiple Congenital Anomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of \nUnknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nSince the publication of the 2013 TEC Special Report, several studies have been published that address the use of either WES (see Table 1)  in clinical practice. Typically, the populations \nincluded in these studies have had suspected rare genetic disorders, although the specific populations vary.  Smith (2019 ) reported a scoping review of genome and exome sequencing \nas a diagnostic tool for pediatric patients.\n[8] The authors identified 171 publications, although \n131 were case reports. They concluded that diagnostic yield was the only consistently reported outcome. The median diagnostic yield in publications including more than single case reports was 33% but varied by broad clinical categories and test type.  \nSeries have been reported with as many as 2, 000 patients. The most common reason for \nreferral to a tertiary care center was an unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder. Many \n\nGT76 | 8 patients had been through standard clinical workup and testing without identification of a \ngenetic variant to explain their condition. Diagnostic yield in these studies, defined as the proportion of tested patients with clinically relevant genomic abnormalities, ranged from 25% to 48%. Because there is no reference standard for the diagnosis of patients who have exhausted alternative testing strategies, clinical confirmation may be the only method for determining false- positive and false- negative rates. No reports were identified of incorrect \ndiagnoses, and how often they might occur is unclear. When used as a first -line test in infants \nwith multiple congenital abnormalities and dysmorphic features, diagnostic yield may be as high as 58%. Testing parent -child trios has been reported to increase diagnostic yield, to \nidentify an inherited variant from an unaffected parent and be considered benign, or to identify a de novo variant not present in an unaffected parent. First -line trio testing for children with \ncomplex  neurologic disorders was shown to increase the diagnostic yield (29%, plus a possible \ndiagnostic finding in 27%) compared with a standard clinical pathway (7%) performed in parallel in the same patients .\n[9] \nTable 1.

These series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 22% to 58%, depending on the individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. Comparative studies have reported an increase in diagnostic yield compared with standard testing strategies. Thus, for individuals who have a suspected genetic etiology but for whom the specific genetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. A genetic diagnosis for these patients is reported to change management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. \nWES for Children with a Suspected Genetic Disorder Other Than Multiple Congenital \nAnomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of Unknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nMost of the literature on WES is on neurodevelopmental disorders in children; however, other \npotential indications for WES have been reported (see Table 2 ). These include limb- girdle \nmuscular dystrophy, inherited retinal disease, and other disorders including mitochondrial, endocrine, and immunologic disorders.  \nTable 2.

VUS: variant of uncertain significance  \nSection Summary  \nThere is an increasing number of reports assessing use of WES identify a molecular basis for \ndisorders other than multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies ranged from 3% for colorectal cancer to 60% for trio (parents and child) analysis of limb- girdle muscular dystrophy. Some studies have reported on the use \nof a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease- associated genes, and the authors \nnoted that WES data allows reanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder, and study of WES in these disorders is at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  \nWHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING (WGS)  \nA 2020 Health Technology Assessment conducted by Ontario Health, with literature searches conducted in January 2019, included a comparative review of the diagnostic yield of WES and WGS in children with unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies.\n[47] The diagnostic yield across all studies was 37% (95% CI 34% to 40%). More \nstudies, with an overall larger sample size, were included in the examination on WES (34 \n\nGT76 | 15 studies, n=9,142) than on whole genome sequencing (nine studies, n=648). Confidence \nintervals for studies using WES versus WGS overlapped (37%, 95% CI 34% to 40% vs. 40%, \n95% CI 32% to 49%). Diagnostic yield ranged between 16% and 73%, with variation attributed largely to technology used and participant selection. The overall quality of the evidence was \nrated as very low, downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision.  \nThis body of evidence suggests that the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup. However, it is not possible to determine from these studies the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis following WES.  \nIn some studies of WGS, the genes examined were those previously associated with the phenotype, while other studies were research -based and conducted more exploratory analysis. \nIt has been noted that genomes sequenced with WGS are available for future review when new variants associated with clinical diseases are discovered.\n[48] Studies have shown that \nWGS can detect more pathogenic variants than WES, due to an improvement in detecting copy number variants, insertions and deletions, intronic single nucleotide variants, and exonic single nucleotide variants in regions with poor coverage on WES. Most studies of  WGS \nindicated that only pathogenic or likely -pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic \nyield and that variants of uncertain significance were not reported (see Table 3). Five studies included in the Ontario HTA review provided data on the yield of VUS, with an overall yield of 17%. Only one of the five  studies used WGS, however. The review authors noted, \"Whole \ngenome sequencing always results in substantially longer lists of variants of unknown significance than whole exome sequencing does. Interpreting and acting upon variants of unknown clinical significance is the single greatest challenge identified by clinicians….”\n[47] \nThe use of WGS and rapid WGS has been studied in critically ill children in several observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, two  randomized controlled trial s \n(RCTs), and one systematic review. Studies are described in Table 6. The systematic review \nand RCTs are discussed in more detail in the following systematic review and r andomized \ncontrolled trials sections. One study included only infants with cardiac defects and had a \ndiagnostic yield of 6% with WGS. The remaining studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60%.  \nTable 3.

Three RCTs were included. The mean age of study participants was two days to 18 years. The quality of evidence was rated as \n\nGT76 | 21 high for the included RCTs and moderate for the observational studies.  The meta- analysis \nrevealed a statistically significantly higher  pooled diagnostic yield for WGS, 38.6% (95% CI  \n32.6 to 45.0) , compared to WES, 37.8% (95% CI  32.9 to 42.9) , and usual care, 7.8% (95% CI  \n4.4 to 13.2) . The review authors concluded that although whole genome sequencing for the \npediatric population with suspected genetic disorders provided an accurate and early genetic \ndiagnosis in a high proportion of cases, further research is needed to evaluate costs, effectiveness, and cost -effectiveness of WGS.  \nRandomized Controlled Trials  \nKingsmore (2019) reported early results of a randomized trial comparing rapid WGS (rWGS) to \nrapid WES (rWES) for seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology at a single center  \n(NSIGHT2 trial ).\n[35] Of the 578 eligible infants, 213 were enrolled in the study, 24 of whom were \nvery ill and received ultra- rapid WGS (ultra -rWGS) without randomization. Ninety -four of the \nremaining 189 infants were randomized to receive rWGS and 95 to receive rWES. The diagnostic yield of ultra -rWGS for the 24 very ill infants was 11 (46%)  and the median time to \nresult was 4.6 days. The diagnostic  yields were very similar for both randomized groups  (18/94 \n[19%] for rWGS and 19/95 [20%] for rWES), as were the times to results, which were 11.0 and \n11.2 days for rWGS and rWES, respectively.  Dimmock (2020)  reported results of the primary \nendpoint of NSIGHT2: clinician perception that rWGS was useful and clinic ian-reported \nchanges in management.\n[51] Clinicians provided perceptions of the clinical utility of diagnostic \ngenomic sequencing for 201 of 213 infants randomized (94%). In 154 (77%) infants, diagnostic genomic sequencing was perceived to be useful or very useful; perceptions of usefulness did not differ between infants who received rWES and rWGS, nor between ultra- rWGS and \nrWES/rWGS. Thirty -two (15%) of 207 clinician responses indicated that diagnostic genomic \nsequencing changed infant outcomes (by targeted treatments in 21 infants, avoidance of complications in 16, and institution of palliative care in two  infants). Changes in outcome did \nnot differ significantly between infants randomized to rWES and rWGS, although ultra- rWGS \nwas associated with a significantly  higher rate of change in manag ement than rWES/rWGS \n(63% vs. 23% , p=0.0001).  \nPetrikin (2018) reported on the INSIGHT1 RCT of rWGS  to diagnose suspected genetic \ndisorders in critically ill infants.\n[58] INSIGHT1 was an investigator -initiated (funded by National \nHuman Genome Research Institute [NHGRI] and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD]), blinded, pragmatic trial comparing trio rWGS with standard genetic tests to standard genetic tests alone with a primary outcome of proportion of NICU/PICU infants receiving a genetic diagnosis within 28 days. Parents of patients and clinicians were unblinded after 10 days and compassionate cross -over to rWGS \noccurred in five  control patients. The study was designed to enroll 500 patients in each group \nbut was terminated early due to loss of equipoise on the part of study clinicians who began to regard standard tests alone as inferior to standard tests plus trio rWGS. Intention- to-treat \nanalyses were reported, i.e., crossovers were included in the group to which they were randomized. The trial required confirmatory testing of WGS results which lengthened the time to rWGS diagnosis by 7 to 10 days. Molecular diagnosis was achieved in 31% of the rWGS \ngroup, compared with 3% in the standard testing group (p=0.003). The time to diagnosis was also significantly shorter in the rWGS group (13 days vs. 107 days, p=0.002).  \nIn the NICUSeq RCT, Krantz (2021) compared rWGS (test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease at five  sites in the US.\n[50] In 76% of cases, both \n\nGT76 | 22 parents were available for trio testing. Overall, 82 of 354 infants received a diagnosis (23%), \nwith a higher yield in the 15- day group. The primary outcome was change in management, \nmeasured at day 60. Significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs 10.3% , p=0.009, odds ratio 2.3, 95% \nCI 1.22 to 4.32). Changes in management included subspecialty referral (21 of 354, 6.0%), changes to medication (5 of 354, 1.4%), therapeutics specific to the primary genetic etiology (7 of 354, 2.0%) and surgical interventions (12 of 354, 3.4%). Survival and length of stay did not \ndiffer between the groups.  \nSection Summary \nWGS has been studied in critically ill and non- critically ill children with congenital abnormalities \nand development delays of unknown etiology following standard workup.  The diagnostic yield \nfor WGS has been reported between 20% and 40%. Additional indirect evidence is available from studies reporting diagnostic yield and change in management results of WES in a similar population, and it is reasonable to expect that WGS is likely to result in similar or better diagnostic yield for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and similar changes in management as compared with WES. WGS has also been studied in children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup. The diagnostic yield of WGS has been between 9% and 55%.  However, these studies include mixed indications with heterogenous populations and include little information about associated changes in management following genetic diagnosis . \nWES/WGS FOR OTHER INDICATIONS \nWES/WGS for Preimplantation  \nPeters (2015) reported on the results of WGS performed on three 5- to 10- cell biopsies from \ntwo blastocyst -stage embryos in order to detect single base de novo variants and small \ninsertions and deletions.\n[73] Both parents and paternal grandparents were also analyzed in \norder to measure false- positive and false- negative error rates. Overall, great than 95% of each \ngenome was called. Experimentally derived haplotypes were used to detect up to 82% of de \nnovo SNVs with a false -positive rate of about one error per gigabase, resulting in fewer than \n10 errors per embryo. The authors state that this represents an approximately 100- fold lower \nerror rate than previously published from 10- cell embryos, and it is the first  demonstration that \nWGS can be used to accurately identify de novo variants in spite of the thousands of false-positive errors introduced by the extensive DNA amplification required for deep sequencing.  \nWES/WGS for Pre natal Fetal Testing \nGirolamo (2023) published a systematic review and meta- analysis to estimate the incremental \nyield of detecting pathogenic or likely pathogenic diagnostic genetic variants (DGV) by whole exome sequencing (WES) over standard karyotype and chromosomal microarray (CMA) analyses in fetuses with isolated increased nuchal translucency (NT) and normal fetal anatomy at the time of 11- 14 weeks scan.\n[74] The secondary outcomes were the detection of a genetic \nvariant of unknown significance. Sub- analysis according to different NT cutoffs (between 3.0 \nand 5.5 mm and > 5.5 mm) and considering fetuses with isolated NT in which fetal anatomy was confirmed to be normal at the anomaly scan were also performed.  Eight articles (324 \nfetuses) were included in the systematic review. Of the fetuses with negative standard karyotype and CMA analysis, the 8.07% (95% CI 5.4 to 11.3) had pathogenic or likely \n\nGT76 | 23 pathogenic genetic variants detected exclusively by WES. When stratifying the analysis \naccording to NT cutoffs, genetic anomalies detected exclusively at WES analysis were found in 44.70% (95% CI 26.8 to 63.4) of fetuses with NT between 3.0 mm and 5.5 mm and 55.3% \n(95% CI 36.6 to 73.2) in those fetuses with NT >5.5 mm and positive WES results. The 7.84% \n(95% CI 1.6 to18.2) had variants of unknown significance identified by WES.  Pathogenic and \nlikely pathogenic genetic variants detected by WES are present in a significant proportion of \nfetuses with increased NT but normal standard karyotype and CMA analysis, also when no anomalies are detected at the anomaly scan. Further large studies sharing objective protocols of imaging assessment are needed to confirm these findings . \nMellis (2022) published a systematic review and meta- analysis of WES for prenatal diagnosis \nof fetal structural anomalies, which included data from 66 studies  and 4, 350 fetuses  that had \nnormal karyotype or CMA testing.\n[75] The incremental diagnostic yield of WES in this setting \nwas reported to be 31% (95% CI 26% to 36% ) and was higher in cases that were pre- selected \nas likely having monogenic disorders (42% vs. 15%). By phenotype, the yield was also higher in cases with skeletal abnormalities (53%) and lowest in cases with isolated increased nuchal translucency (2%).  \nWES/WGS for Pregnancy Loss  \nQiao (2016) evaluated the use of WES to identify genetic causes of idiopathic recurrent early pregnancy loss (RPL), assessing seven euploid miscarriages from four families with RPL.\n[76] \nThe study identified compound heterozygous pathogenic variants of DYNC2H1  and ALOX15  in \ntwo out of four families with RPL. Although the authors concluded that CNVs, individual SNVs and pool of deleterious gene variants identified by exome sequencing could contribute to RPL, they acknowledge that the study has limitations, mainly the small  sample cohort is small and \nthat functional analysis of the candidate variants must be evaluated to determine whether the variants are causative.  \nWHOLE TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING  \nTranscriptome sequencing has been used mainly as a research tool to identify potential \nmarkers for understanding disease pathologies or identifying markers for disease detection. \nLimited clinical studies of transcriptome sequencing have been published. For  example, a \nstudy by Walter (2021) compared whole transcriptome sequencing to WGS in 279 patients \nwith acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; B-cell n=211, T- cell n = 68) .[77] Transcriptome \nsequencing was able to distinguish between B -cell ALL and T- cell ALL based on the \nexpression of 14 markers, and it was used to identify  a number of gene fusions.   \nPRACTICE GUIDELINE SUMMARY \nAMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL GENETICS \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical \npractice guideline for the use of WES and WGS in pediatric patients and made the following recommendation: \"We strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second- tier test \n(guided by clinical judgment and often clinician- patient/family shared decision making after \nCMA or focused testing) for patients with one or more [congenital anomalies]  prior to one year \nof age or for patients with [developmental delay/intellec tual disability]  with onset prior to 18 \nyears of age.\"\n[78] The recommendation was informed by a systematic evidence review and a \nhealth technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.  \n\nGT76 | 24 In 2015, ACMG published a policy statement updating their 2013 their recommendation s for \nanalysis and reporting of secondary/ incidental findings in whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing .[79, 80] \n• The panel states that patients must be made aware, it the time of consent, that \nlaboratories routinely analyze the sequence of a set of genes deemed to be highly medically actionable so as to detect pathogenic variants that may predispose to a severe but preventable disease. \n• Although patients have the choice to opt out of receiving these results, that they should be made aware of the ramifications of doing so.  \nDue to the inherent difficulty of counseling patients about the features of each disorder and every gene deemed actionable by the ACMG, analysis and reporting of secondary findings should apply to the entire list of medically actionable genes, and not a subset.  \nSUMMARY  \nThere is enough research to show that whole exome sequencing (WES) can increase diagnosis rates and improve health outcomes for certain children who are suspected of having a genetic disorder. In some situations, WES testing may prevent the need for more invasive diagnostic tests, such as muscle biopsy. Therefore, WES may be considered \nmedically necessary when policy criteria are met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole exome sequencing (WES) improves health outcomes for patients who do not meet the policy criteria, including adults and individuals with signs and symptoms consistent with a well -known disorder that can be \nidentified by targeted testing. Therefore, WES is considered investigational when policy criteria are not met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) can \nbe used to improve patient health outcomes.  In addition, there are technical limitations such \nas the lack of standardized laboratory procedures, gaps in interpreting ancillary information, and the detection of variants of uncertain significance. Therefore, the use of WGS  is \nconsidered investigational for all indications.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole transcriptome sequencing can be used to improve patient health outcomes.  This technology has been primarily used in the \nresearch setting and there is little evidence regarding its clinical use.  Therefore, whole \ntranscriptome sequencing is considered investigational for all indications.  \nREFERENCES  \n 1. den Dunnen JT, Dalgleish R, Maglott DR, et al.

strongly recommended prior to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) or Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in order to inform persons being tested about the advantages and limitations of the test as applied to their unique \nsituation.  \n WES refers to the sequence determination of the exome. The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that \nencodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome.  (Chung, 2023)  \n \nMost known disease- causing variants are found in the exons, and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient \nanalysis can be completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016) . WES results in long lists \nof genetic variants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify \ndisease causing mutations . (Richards et al., 2015)  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome.  (MedlinePlus , 2020b) . This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions , and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023).  As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and  focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years . \n(Taber et al., 2015)  \n Another type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid (RNA). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transc ribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the \ncollective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA present in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology indications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM), uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at spec ific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications (Mantere et al., 2021). OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n Chung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases. The meta-analysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations over a period of 10 years (2011- 2021). Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility (defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes t o clinical management following a diagnosis by ES or GS), \nrates of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from ES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies and evaluated. The analysi s revealed comparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36- 0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall, and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35- 0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I\n2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%). Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES (2- 579 for GS vs 1- 75 for ES), but the rate of VUS was not significantly different ( p = .78). Of the \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n nine studies (2,269 probands) that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times greater than ES \n(95% CI 0.79- 1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With respect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results. Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% - 16%. A signific ant difference in the diagn ostic rate between ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2,361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40- 0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta-\nanalysis. Additionally, of ten QUADAS -2 assessed, high- quality studies (2,170 probands) reporting on clinical utility, GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30- 0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant published literature. Twenty studies, including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES  and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA, met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was potential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta- regression. Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of  the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%), and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals with short stature and provide a strong base of reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes, which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals.  \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS, for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies su pporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals with this disorder. Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of individuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023)  Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES  or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low - quality evidence was found for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified. Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis. Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately 37 art icles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affected famil y members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unexplained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by  Ewans  et al.  (2018) and Bowling  et al.  (2017), previously discussed  in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used in 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \nwere epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secon dary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS was performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year, and for those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undiagnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use of genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD. The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay (DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for this study, which took pl ace in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. They found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine experienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to \nhigh diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s participants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid- 2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative included COL2A1  (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies ( n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2- 22%). For WGS, outcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes; Hayes notes that additional studies evaluating both larger numbers and a broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n \nAn additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did does not address ID in individuals  with other disorders including NDD or global DD, which are discussed in separate Hayes reports. No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies and subtypes of NDD, Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing (NGS) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel sequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and \n28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was \nnot statically significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p =  .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found in this review compared to previous studies. The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; this systematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. In addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy, and this review included panel -based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were included. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, th is study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy, Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral palsy; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare- based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years and the health care- based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort (predominantly pediatric), molecular diagnostic yield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort (predominantly adult), it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participan ts and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts. Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for sequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care- based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized tria l incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days). The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 day s (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants \nwere racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that twice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group receive d a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed group at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study, however, showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical \nmanagement and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for criti cally ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretati on of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a lower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined in this study.  \n In a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who \nwere recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequ encing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, \nophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rhe umatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for cases with etiologic noncoding, structural and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for clinical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical outcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Malinowski et al. (2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS. \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy. Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was identified. Ultimately, 167 articles were i ncluded; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly al l included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision- making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by St ark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al. (2016), Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al.  \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Malinowski et al. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 participants that were extensively ph enotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare \ndiseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolomics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of ad ults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately \n6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to  aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020) examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASDs  (n = 4), DD/ID ( n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting. A total of  37 pathogenic /likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals  (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the \nSNVs identified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3%. For the individuals that had positive results, \n36.7% and 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals  \nwith DD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their cohort \ncompared to traditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that t hey also achieved their secondary objectives \nof decreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluations) addressed ES for use in individuals with (NDDs). \nThe study included a meta- analysis and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES \nwith that of CMA in affected individuals. The study defined NDD as global DD, ID and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles \naddressing diagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of \nES was 36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions), which is substantially greater \nthan previous studies focused on CMA (15- 20%). The researchers conclude that the study showed consistently better \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have been less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneous cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing. Publications by  Vissers et al.  (2017), Tarailo- Graovac  et al.  (2016), Retterer  et al.  \n(2016) , and Lee  et al.  (2014), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in the Srivastava systematic review and \nmeta- analysis.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 11 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Groopman et al. (2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 \nyears of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnostic resul t in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionabl e findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score and standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and \nfor the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes. In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) w ere found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome analysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes, however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH -funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none of which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance \nrate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malformations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub- group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early \nintervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome,  type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset  disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and  were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT  and G6PD . Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could impact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines arise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by fact ors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond that currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.   \n In order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was 2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were \nfound, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n As part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield. In some cases, family testing was performed to \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 12 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n determine gene segregation and verify pathogenicity. The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent specialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary spastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n Bardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical \nindications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing for Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes \nwere selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in \n52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platforms or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the involvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.   \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August \n2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta‐ analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utilit y of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of WES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WGS and WES was not significantly different. In studies with in-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference lab interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statisticall y significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnosti c rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be considered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n \nThe diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One B RCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a \nchange in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/601, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non- sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling for variant discussion.  \n \nAnother study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a \ncohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioRe source Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality was poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate varied by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individua ls had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that \nthe WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection rate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 –5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from consan guineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A, PPOX, FRMPD4, and SCN1B, and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a fi rst-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics ’ laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n neurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening  \nA 2023 systematic review and meta- analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Seco ndary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 47%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9- 24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27- 51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time for CMA/WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended.  Publications by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies \nwhere CMA had been negative. Testing took place between the 12th and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded ( n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm). For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence variation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was \n40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS, related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply. The researchers assert that although this \nstudy  is limited by small sample size, the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use.  \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies w ere included in this review, representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled incremental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre- selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases ( 42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these \nresults, the researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a di agnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with \nstructural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending \non the body system impacted and can be increased by specific pre- selection of cases after a  multi- disciplinary review \nindicating likelihood of a monogenic cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies \nthat were evaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of analysis which likely impact diagnostic yield  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of \nprenatal ES to gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritize cases for testing and the challenges that exist for interpreting variants w ith incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding \nphenotype. Publications by  Chen et al.  (2020), Deden et al.  (2020), Lord et al.  (2019), Petrovski  et al.  (2019) , Aarabi  et al.  \n(2018),  Fu et al.  (2018) , and Normand et al.  (2018), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in this systematic \nreview.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 15 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were obtained prior to exome analysis. After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely path ogenic variants were \nidentified that were de termined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progressed. The authors \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogeni c variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta- analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies) with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yield of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these, 42% of variants were \nhomozygous. Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appe ar to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndromes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon.  \n \nA 2020 (updated 2023 ) Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS related to \nimprovement of diagnosis and assistance with pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are \ndetected by ultrasound or other testing is lacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for the use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologi c diseases. Specifically, relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions and deletions and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP). This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals, 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels. Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platform used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals, which, according to their referring clinicians, would ena ble \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to lead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to efficient re analysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n In an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children  \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \nundiagnosed c hildren who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re- evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of better bioinformatic pipelines, improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification of previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact  the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. The study showed that not all afflicted individuals will undergo routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey, \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting and considered all di sease- related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new di agnoses, however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The \nliterature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examined 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two years of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new \ndiagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs. The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n \nAlfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of WES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton \nsystem. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs may  not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the study and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclusive WES results. Most were male (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patien ts \nhad complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS results with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because the data that demonstrated their pathogenicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original \nraw data files were not available from this lab to determin e if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four \nvariants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re- analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n and the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of positives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n \nTo evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis, Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date soft ware and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnosti c exomes. This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 –3-year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of relat ionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround- times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinical utility of these rapid and ult ra-rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra -rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), \ndiscussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gu bbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nDimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed had cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in \nGenomic Medicine and  Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). \nThe goal of the NSIGHT study was to comp are two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two \ninterpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who \nreceived urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra-\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 \nhours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. O f the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, respectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n urWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0.0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \nwere randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, cr itically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to l ess seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of bot h tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with undiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30- 50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. Sanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings outside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n \nClark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a provisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the \nmean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four timed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling took \na median of 1 hour and is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant variants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and \noptimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and l ogical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was selected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospecti vely in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with t wo children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the \nprior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously il l infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 hours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger sequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Whole Transcriptome Sequencing  \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS. The results of RNAseq were combined with gen ome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional seven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels, and SVs were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 samples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7– 27%), bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29 –48%). The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of RNAseq. The study was limited by its small cohort size which underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center, \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional \nstudies on broader populations and focused on improv ement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication. Although it shows early promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, further development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential clinical \nutility.  \n Mantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities in a proof -of-principle study. In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra- high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM. The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not ( n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders ( n = 15), family history of chromosome abnormality ( n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound ( n = \n9). The result was compared to known anomalies obtained via current standard- of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities. They foresee continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- quality clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n \nAdditional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications . (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023)  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified \nthrough routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available. Evidence \nLevel C . (Kang et al., 2015, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 20 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nIn an AANEM 2016 consensus statement, the group stated that while they do not endorse or recommend a specific \ntesting methodology, genetic testing to establish a molecular diagnosis is a crucial step in providing optimal care to \nindividuals with neuromuscular disorders . (Kassardjian et al., 2016, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \nIn a 2021 practice guideline authored by Manickam et al., the ACMG asserts their position that evidenced- based literature \nsupports clinical utility of whole exome and whole genome sequencing on both active and long- term management of \nindividuals with congenital anomalies, developmental delay and intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). Based on their comprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first - or second - tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of standard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0 (Miller et al., 2021b), contained 73 genes and detailed the way that genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list (v3.1); a total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR  (hereditary TTR amyloidosis). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome), bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n Monaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health- care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be obtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n A 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test results. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re- evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory work collaboratively in the testing process.”  \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significance,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the i nterpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole-\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”   \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021) addressing the management of stillbirth indicates that whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023)  Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances (e.g., fetuses with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific  genes of  clinical interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances, WES or WGS  may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG, and Horizon 2020 project Solve- RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases using various analytical techniques. The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, \nefficiency and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed \nin accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal anomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple organ system anomalies ; and \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies ; and \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a fetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline . \n \nThe guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or neurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and \ncomprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)  \nIn a 2022 evidence- based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology. The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing, followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider \nin the context of appropriate pre-  and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n \nThis section is to be used for informational purposes only.

Benefit determinations are based in all cases on the applicable contract \nlanguage. To the extent there may be any conflict between the Medical Policy and contract language, the contract \nlanguage takes precedence.  \nPLEASE NOTE: Contracts exclude from coverage, among other things, services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers may bill members for services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers are e ncouraged to inform members before rendering such \nservices that the members are likely to be financially responsible for the cost of these services.  \n \nDESCRIPTION  \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is defined as targeted sequencing of the subset of the human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein- coding DNA.  Whole \ngenome sequencing (WGS) uses next -generation sequencing techniques to sequence both \ncoding- and non- coding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed to be \nmore efficient than traditional sequencing methods in discovering the genetic causes of diseases  and other indications . \nMEDICAL POLICY CRITERIA  \n \nNote:  This policy does not address tumor tissue or cell -free DNA testing for targeted \ntreatment of cancer (see Cross References  section ). \nI. Whole exome sequencing may be considered medically necessary for the evaluation \nof unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in pediatric patients (age 17 \nyears and younger) when all of the following criteria (A. – C.) are met:  \nA. The patient has had a clinical evaluation and has been informed about the \npotential risks of genetic testing; and \nB. There is clinical documentation that  whole exome sequencing results will guide \ndecisions for medical management; and \nC. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the patient’s \n\n\nGT76 | 2 phenotype, and one of the following is met:  \n1. The clinical presentation is not consistent with a well -described genetic \nsyndrome for which targeted genetic testing is available; or  \n2. Previous targeted genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis and whole \nexome sequencing may prevent the need for  invasive procedures as the next \ndiagnostic step (e.g. , muscle biopsy) .  \nII. Whole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic \ndisorders when Criterion I. is not met, including but not limited to prenatal or \npreimplantation testing.  \nIII. Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \nIV. Whole transcriptome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \n \nNOTE: A summary of the supporting rationale for the policy criteria is at the end of the policy.  \nLIST OF INFORMATION NEEDED FOR REVIEW  \nSUBMISSION OF GENETIC TESTING DOCUMENTATION \nAll of the following information must be submitted for review prior to the genetic testing:  \n• Name of genetic test(s)  and/or panel test   \n• Name of performing laboratory and/or genetic testing organization (more than one may \nbe listed)  \n• Date of blood draw or sample collection  \n• Relevant billing codes  \n• Brief description of how the genetic test results will guide clinical decisions that would \nnot otherwise be made in the absence of testing \n• Clinical d ocumentation that the risks of testing have been discussed \nCROSS REFERENCES  \n1.

It is being implemented for genetic testing \nmedical evidence review updates starting in 2017. According to this nomenclature, the term “variant” is used to describe a change in a DNA or protein sequence, repl acing previously \nused terms, such as “mutation.” Pathogenic variants are variants associated with disease, \nwhile benign variants are not. The majority of genetic changes have unknown effects on human health, and these are referred to as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) . \nCurrently available clinical assays designed for the molecular diagnosis of rare Mendelian diseases are incomplete. This is due to genetic heterogeneity, the presence of unknown \ncausative genes, and because only a portion of the known genes and variant s can be \nefficiently tested using conventional molecular methods. Recently, next -generation sequencing \n(NGS)  technologies have become more accessible in terms of cost and speed and have been \nadopted by a growing number of molecular genetic clinical laboratories.  \nDepending on the disorder and the degree of genetic and clinical heterogeneity, the current \ndiagnostic pathway for patients with suspected genetic disorders accompanied by multiple anomalies may depend on various combinations of low -yield radiographic, \nelectrophysiological, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic evaluations.\n[2] The search for a \ndiagnosis may thus become a time- consuming and expensive process. When a disease-\ncausing gene(s) is established, assays based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  technology, \nfor example, can be designed to specifically detect known variant s for clinical diagnosis. When \nmany different single -nucleotide variants (SNVs)  in a gene are possible, Sanger sequencing, \nthe current gold standard for detecting unknown SNVs , can be employed to determine the \nentire sequence of the coding and intron/exon splice sites of gene regions where variant s are \nmost likely to be found. However, when genes are large and variant s are possible in many or \nall exons (protein- coding regions of the gene), and when there is genetic (locus) heterogeneity, \ncomprehensive Sanger sequencing may be prohibitively laborious and costly.  \nWES using NGS technology is a relatively new approach to obtaining a genetic diagnosis in \npatients more efficiently compared with traditional methods. Exome sequencing has the capacity to determine an individual’s exomic variation profile in a single assay. This profile is \nlimited to most of the protein coding sequence of an individual (approximately 85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons, and constitutes approximately 1% of the whole genome. It is believed that the exome contains about 85% of heritable disease- causing \nvariant s. \nPublished studies have show n that exome sequencing can be used to detect previously \nannotated pathogenic variant s and reveal new likely pathogenic variant s in known and \nunknown genes. A limited number of studies have reported that the diagnostic yield of exome \nsequencing  appears to be significantly increased above that of traditional Sanger sequencing, \nwhile  also being faster and more efficien t relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.  \nWGS uses similar techniques to WES but involves the sequencing of noncoding DNA in addition to the protein- coding segments of the genome.  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing involves the use of NGS to sequence RNA molecules instead of DNA.  \nLIMITATIONS OF WES  AND WGS \n\nGT76 | 4 At this time, the limitations of WES  and WGS  include technical and implementation challenges. \nThere are issues of error rates due to uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture prior \nto sequencing, and difficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without losing likely candidate variant s. It is difficult to filter and interpret \npotential causative variants from the large number of variants of unknown significance (VUS)  \ngenerated for each patient. Variant databases are poorly annotated, and algorithms for annotating variants will need to be automated. Existing databases that catalog variants and putative disease associations are known to have significant entry error rates.  \nApproaches for characterizing the functional impact of rare and novel variants (i.e., achieving full-genome clinical interpretations that are scientifically sound and medically relevant) have to \nbe improved. The variability contributed by the different platforms and procedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service is unknown, and detailed guidance from regulatory and professional organizations is still under development. Finally, exome sequencing has some similar limitations as Sanger sequencing and will not \nidentify the following: intronic sequences or gene regulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions, duplications or rearrangements within genes; nucleotide repeats; or epigenetic changes. WGS address some of these limitations but is limited by the need for increased analytic power and the likelihood of greater identification of VUS. \nThere are also ethical questions about reporting incidental findings such as identifying \nmedically relevant variant s in genes unrelated to the diagnostic question, sex chromosome \nabnormalities, and non- paternity when family studies are performed. Standards for the \nrequired components of informed consent before WES/WGS is performed have been proposed and include a description of confidentiality and a description of how incidental findings will be managed.\n[3] Methods of reporting findings from WES/WGS are in development. \nFor example, McLaughlin et al, reporting on the MedSeq Project which is testing methods for evaluating and reporting WES/WGS data, described the development of a genome report that highlights results  that are significant to the indication being evaluated.\n[4] \nRESULTS OF TESTING WITH WES/WGS[5] \n1. A variant known to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• This is a sequence variant that has been shown through prior genetic and clinical research to cause a disease.  \n2. A variant suspected to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• Most variants detected by WES sequencing are uncharacterized and some are \nnovel (i.e., never known to have been observed in a human sample). Some variants \nallow for relatively easy and accurate clinical interpretation; however, for most there is little dat a on which to base an assessment of causality. Tools to facilitate the \nassessment of causality include bioinformatic analyses, predicted structural changes, and others. While these tools may be useful, their predictive power is highly variable. In addition, each clinical laboratory offering WES/WGS testing have their own “in- house” algorithm to facilitate assessment and classification of these \nvariants.  \n\nGT76 | 5 3. A variant of uncertain significance (VOUS/VUS)  is identified.   \n• Among the known 30,000 to 40,000 variants that reside in the protein- coding \nportions of the genome, the typical subject will have three to eight  actionable \nvariants. (Most relate to reproductive risks, i .e., heterozygous carrier alleles.) But the \nremaining thousands are either highly likely to be benign or of uncertain clinical \nsignificance. It can be equally as challenging to prove that a variant is benign as it is to prove it is pathogenic. Currently, nearly all variants among the tens of thousands must b e considered of uncertain significance.   \nAVAILABLE TESTING SERVICES  \nWES  \nExamples of some laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service and their \nindications for testing are summarized in the table below.  \nLaboratory  Laboratory indications for testing \nAmbry Genetics  “The patient's clinical presentation is unclear/atypical disease and there are \nmultiple genetic conditions in the differential diagnosis.”  \nGeneDx  “a patient with a diagnosis that suggests the involvement of one or more of many different genes, which would, if even available and sequenced individually, be prohibitively expensive”  \nBaylor College of Medicine “used when a patient’s medical history and physical exam findings strongly \nsuggest that there is an underlying genetic etiology. In some cases, the \npatient may have had an extensive evaluation consisting of multiple genetic tests, without identifying an etiology.” Baylor also offers a prenatal WES \ntest. \nUniversity of California Los Angeles Health System  “This test is intended for use in conjunction with the clinical presentation and other markers of disease progression for the management of patients with rare genetic disorders.”  \nEdgeBio Recommended “In situations where there has been a diagnostic failure with no discernible path . . . In situations where there are currently no available \ntests to determine the status of a potential genetic disease . . . In situations \nwith atypical findings  indicative of multiple disease[s]”  \nChildren’s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics  Provided as a service to families with children who have had an extensive negative work -up for a genetic disease; also used to identify novel disease \ngenes.  \nEmory Genetics Laboratory  “Indicated when there is a suspicion of a genetic etiology contributing to the proband’s manifestations.”  \nKnight Diagnostic Laboratory  “diagnosing rare hereditary diseases, inconclusive results from targeted panel tests, presentation of multiple phenotypes or when a patient presents an unknown or novel phenotype.”  \nWGS  \nAlthough WGS has been used as a research tool, it is less well -developed as a clinical service. \nSeveral laboratories offer WGS as a clinical service. \n\nGT76 | 6 Transcriptome Sequencing  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing is primarily used as a research tool, but several labs now \noffer such testing for clinical purposes.  \nREGULATORY STATUS  \nNo U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -cleared genotyping tests were found. Thus, \ngenotyping is offered as a laboratory -developed test. Clinical laboratories may develop and \nvalidate tests in- house (“home- brew”) and market them as a laboratory service.  Such tests \nmust meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). \nThe laboratory offering the service must be licensed by CLIA for high- complexity testing.  \nEVIDENCE SUMMARY  \nValidation of the clinical use of any genetic test focuses on three main principles:  \n1. The analytic validity of the test, which refers to the technical accuracy of the test in detecting a variant  that is present or in excluding a variant  that is absent;  \n2. The clinical validity of the test, which refers to the diagnostic performance of the test (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) in detecting clinical disease; and  \n3. The clinical utility of the test, i.e., how the results of the diagnostic test will be used to change management of the patient and whether these changes in management lead to clinically important improvements in health outcomes.  \nThe focus of the literature search was on evidence related to the ability of genetic test results to: \n• Guide decisions in the clinical setting related to either treatment, management, or prevention, and  \n• Improve health outcomes as a result of those decisions.  \nWHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING (WES)  \nThe clinical validity  of WES is related to the diagnostic performance of this technology, while \nthe clinical utility lies in the influence of the results on medical decision making and patient outcomes. For  clinical utility to be established, evidence would be needed of the ability of WES \nto provide the following improvements over other testing methods:  \n• Ability to establish a definitive diagnosis by detection of additional variant s not found by \nother testing methods and leading to management changes that improve outcomes and/or eliminate the need for additional testing   \n• Equivalent or superior accuracy attained with superior efficiency of workup (e.g., diagnosis obtained more quickly) compared with other methods of sequencing.  \nTechnology Assessments \nA 2013 BlueCross BlueShield Association Technology Evaluation Center (TEC) Special Report \non WES in patients with suspected genetic disorders, found no published studies that systematically examined potential outcomes of interest such as changes in medical  \nmanagement (including revision of initial diagnoses), and changes in reproductive decision \n\nGT76 | 7 making after a diagnosis of a Mendelian disorder by WES.[6] The evidence was limited to a \nsmall number of studies of patient series and a larger number of very small series or family \nstudies that reported anecdotal examples of medical management and reproductive decision-making outcomes of exome sequencing in patients who were not diagnosed by traditional methods. These studies showed that, over and above traditional molecular and conventional diagnostic testing, exome sequencing could lead to a diagnosis that influenced patient care and/or reproductive decisions but gave no indication of the proportion of patients for which this was true. The report noted that publication of a large number of small diagnostic studies with positive results but few with negative results raise the possibility of publication bias, the impact of which is unknown.  \nIn 2020, the Washington State Health Care Authority released a technology assessment of \nWES.\n[7] Information on the diagnostic yield of WES was calculated using data from 99 studies. \nThe overall pooled estimate for this was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.7% to 40.6%), \nwhile the pooled yield for gene panels and traditional testing pathways were 27% (95% CI 13.7% to 40.5%) and 21% (95% CI 5.6% to 36.4%), respectively.  The diagnostic yield \ngenerally decreased with increasing patient age. The clinical utility of WES was assessed based on data from 30 studies, most of which were single- arm observational cohort studies. \nThe key findings from this assessment were:  \n• “Among studies that enrolled patients with diverse phenotypes (18 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 12% to 100%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 5% to 25%  \no A WES diagnosis resulted in counseling and genetic testing for family members for between 4% and 97%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with epilepsy (5 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 0% to 31%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 0% to 20%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with a single phenotype (7 studies), all reported some changes in clinical management following a WES diagnosis, but the data was too heterogenous to synthesize into a single range.”  \nThe certainty of the evidence related to clinical utility was rated as very low due to study limitations including study design, inconsistency, and imprecision. Evidence related to health outcomes could not be evaluated due to the substantial limitations in study design and outcome reporting among the seven studies that reported these outcomes.  \nWES f\nor Children with Multiple Congenital Anomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of \nUnknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nSince the publication of the 2013 TEC Special Report, several studies have been published that address the use of either WES (see Table 1)  in clinical practice. Typically, the populations \nincluded in these studies have had suspected rare genetic disorders, although the specific populations vary.  Smith (2019 ) reported a scoping review of genome and exome sequencing \nas a diagnostic tool for pediatric patients.\n[8] The authors identified 171 publications, although \n131 were case reports. They concluded that diagnostic yield was the only consistently reported outcome. The median diagnostic yield in publications including more than single case reports was 33% but varied by broad clinical categories and test type.  \nSeries have been reported with as many as 2, 000 patients. The most common reason for \nreferral to a tertiary care center was an unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder. Many \n\nGT76 | 8 patients had been through standard clinical workup and testing without identification of a \ngenetic variant to explain their condition. Diagnostic yield in these studies, defined as the proportion of tested patients with clinically relevant genomic abnormalities, ranged from 25% to 48%. Because there is no reference standard for the diagnosis of patients who have exhausted alternative testing strategies, clinical confirmation may be the only method for determining false- positive and false- negative rates. No reports were identified of incorrect \ndiagnoses, and how often they might occur is unclear. When used as a first -line test in infants \nwith multiple congenital abnormalities and dysmorphic features, diagnostic yield may be as high as 58%. Testing parent -child trios has been reported to increase diagnostic yield, to \nidentify an inherited variant from an unaffected parent and be considered benign, or to identify a de novo variant not present in an unaffected parent. First -line trio testing for children with \ncomplex  neurologic disorders was shown to increase the diagnostic yield (29%, plus a possible \ndiagnostic finding in 27%) compared with a standard clinical pathway (7%) performed in parallel in the same patients .\n[9] \nTable 1.

These series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 22% to 58%, depending on the individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. Comparative studies have reported an increase in diagnostic yield compared with standard testing strategies. Thus, for individuals who have a suspected genetic etiology but for whom the specific genetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. A genetic diagnosis for these patients is reported to change management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. \nWES for Children with a Suspected Genetic Disorder Other Than Multiple Congenital \nAnomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of Unknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nMost of the literature on WES is on neurodevelopmental disorders in children; however, other \npotential indications for WES have been reported (see Table 2 ). These include limb- girdle \nmuscular dystrophy, inherited retinal disease, and other disorders including mitochondrial, endocrine, and immunologic disorders.  \nTable 2.

VUS: variant of uncertain significance  \nSection Summary  \nThere is an increasing number of reports assessing use of WES identify a molecular basis for \ndisorders other than multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies ranged from 3% for colorectal cancer to 60% for trio (parents and child) analysis of limb- girdle muscular dystrophy. Some studies have reported on the use \nof a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease- associated genes, and the authors \nnoted that WES data allows reanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder, and study of WES in these disorders is at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  \nWHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING (WGS)  \nA 2020 Health Technology Assessment conducted by Ontario Health, with literature searches conducted in January 2019, included a comparative review of the diagnostic yield of WES and WGS in children with unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies.\n[47] The diagnostic yield across all studies was 37% (95% CI 34% to 40%). More \nstudies, with an overall larger sample size, were included in the examination on WES (34 \n\nGT76 | 15 studies, n=9,142) than on whole genome sequencing (nine studies, n=648). Confidence \nintervals for studies using WES versus WGS overlapped (37%, 95% CI 34% to 40% vs. 40%, \n95% CI 32% to 49%). Diagnostic yield ranged between 16% and 73%, with variation attributed largely to technology used and participant selection. The overall quality of the evidence was \nrated as very low, downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision.  \nThis body of evidence suggests that the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup. However, it is not possible to determine from these studies the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis following WES.  \nIn some studies of WGS, the genes examined were those previously associated with the phenotype, while other studies were research -based and conducted more exploratory analysis. \nIt has been noted that genomes sequenced with WGS are available for future review when new variants associated with clinical diseases are discovered.\n[48] Studies have shown that \nWGS can detect more pathogenic variants than WES, due to an improvement in detecting copy number variants, insertions and deletions, intronic single nucleotide variants, and exonic single nucleotide variants in regions with poor coverage on WES. Most studies of  WGS \nindicated that only pathogenic or likely -pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic \nyield and that variants of uncertain significance were not reported (see Table 3). Five studies included in the Ontario HTA review provided data on the yield of VUS, with an overall yield of 17%. Only one of the five  studies used WGS, however. The review authors noted, \"Whole \ngenome sequencing always results in substantially longer lists of variants of unknown significance than whole exome sequencing does. Interpreting and acting upon variants of unknown clinical significance is the single greatest challenge identified by clinicians….”\n[47] \nThe use of WGS and rapid WGS has been studied in critically ill children in several observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, two  randomized controlled trial s \n(RCTs), and one systematic review. Studies are described in Table 6. The systematic review \nand RCTs are discussed in more detail in the following systematic review and r andomized \ncontrolled trials sections. One study included only infants with cardiac defects and had a \ndiagnostic yield of 6% with WGS. The remaining studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60%.  \nTable 3.

Three RCTs were included. The mean age of study participants was two days to 18 years. The quality of evidence was rated as \n\nGT76 | 21 high for the included RCTs and moderate for the observational studies.  The meta- analysis \nrevealed a statistically significantly higher  pooled diagnostic yield for WGS, 38.6% (95% CI  \n32.6 to 45.0) , compared to WES, 37.8% (95% CI  32.9 to 42.9) , and usual care, 7.8% (95% CI  \n4.4 to 13.2) . The review authors concluded that although whole genome sequencing for the \npediatric population with suspected genetic disorders provided an accurate and early genetic \ndiagnosis in a high proportion of cases, further research is needed to evaluate costs, effectiveness, and cost -effectiveness of WGS.  \nRandomized Controlled Trials  \nKingsmore (2019) reported early results of a randomized trial comparing rapid WGS (rWGS) to \nrapid WES (rWES) for seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology at a single center  \n(NSIGHT2 trial ).\n[35] Of the 578 eligible infants, 213 were enrolled in the study, 24 of whom were \nvery ill and received ultra- rapid WGS (ultra -rWGS) without randomization. Ninety -four of the \nremaining 189 infants were randomized to receive rWGS and 95 to receive rWES. The diagnostic yield of ultra -rWGS for the 24 very ill infants was 11 (46%)  and the median time to \nresult was 4.6 days. The diagnostic  yields were very similar for both randomized groups  (18/94 \n[19%] for rWGS and 19/95 [20%] for rWES), as were the times to results, which were 11.0 and \n11.2 days for rWGS and rWES, respectively.  Dimmock (2020)  reported results of the primary \nendpoint of NSIGHT2: clinician perception that rWGS was useful and clinic ian-reported \nchanges in management.\n[51] Clinicians provided perceptions of the clinical utility of diagnostic \ngenomic sequencing for 201 of 213 infants randomized (94%). In 154 (77%) infants, diagnostic genomic sequencing was perceived to be useful or very useful; perceptions of usefulness did not differ between infants who received rWES and rWGS, nor between ultra- rWGS and \nrWES/rWGS. Thirty -two (15%) of 207 clinician responses indicated that diagnostic genomic \nsequencing changed infant outcomes (by targeted treatments in 21 infants, avoidance of complications in 16, and institution of palliative care in two  infants). Changes in outcome did \nnot differ significantly between infants randomized to rWES and rWGS, although ultra- rWGS \nwas associated with a significantly  higher rate of change in manag ement than rWES/rWGS \n(63% vs. 23% , p=0.0001).  \nPetrikin (2018) reported on the INSIGHT1 RCT of rWGS  to diagnose suspected genetic \ndisorders in critically ill infants.\n[58] INSIGHT1 was an investigator -initiated (funded by National \nHuman Genome Research Institute [NHGRI] and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD]), blinded, pragmatic trial comparing trio rWGS with standard genetic tests to standard genetic tests alone with a primary outcome of proportion of NICU/PICU infants receiving a genetic diagnosis within 28 days. Parents of patients and clinicians were unblinded after 10 days and compassionate cross -over to rWGS \noccurred in five  control patients. The study was designed to enroll 500 patients in each group \nbut was terminated early due to loss of equipoise on the part of study clinicians who began to regard standard tests alone as inferior to standard tests plus trio rWGS. Intention- to-treat \nanalyses were reported, i.e., crossovers were included in the group to which they were randomized. The trial required confirmatory testing of WGS results which lengthened the time to rWGS diagnosis by 7 to 10 days. Molecular diagnosis was achieved in 31% of the rWGS \ngroup, compared with 3% in the standard testing group (p=0.003). The time to diagnosis was also significantly shorter in the rWGS group (13 days vs. 107 days, p=0.002).  \nIn the NICUSeq RCT, Krantz (2021) compared rWGS (test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease at five  sites in the US.\n[50] In 76% of cases, both \n\nGT76 | 22 parents were available for trio testing. Overall, 82 of 354 infants received a diagnosis (23%), \nwith a higher yield in the 15- day group. The primary outcome was change in management, \nmeasured at day 60. Significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs 10.3% , p=0.009, odds ratio 2.3, 95% \nCI 1.22 to 4.32). Changes in management included subspecialty referral (21 of 354, 6.0%), changes to medication (5 of 354, 1.4%), therapeutics specific to the primary genetic etiology (7 of 354, 2.0%) and surgical interventions (12 of 354, 3.4%). Survival and length of stay did not \ndiffer between the groups.  \nSection Summary \nWGS has been studied in critically ill and non- critically ill children with congenital abnormalities \nand development delays of unknown etiology following standard workup.  The diagnostic yield \nfor WGS has been reported between 20% and 40%. Additional indirect evidence is available from studies reporting diagnostic yield and change in management results of WES in a similar population, and it is reasonable to expect that WGS is likely to result in similar or better diagnostic yield for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and similar changes in management as compared with WES. WGS has also been studied in children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup. The diagnostic yield of WGS has been between 9% and 55%.  However, these studies include mixed indications with heterogenous populations and include little information about associated changes in management following genetic diagnosis . \nWES/WGS FOR OTHER INDICATIONS \nWES/WGS for Preimplantation  \nPeters (2015) reported on the results of WGS performed on three 5- to 10- cell biopsies from \ntwo blastocyst -stage embryos in order to detect single base de novo variants and small \ninsertions and deletions.\n[73] Both parents and paternal grandparents were also analyzed in \norder to measure false- positive and false- negative error rates. Overall, great than 95% of each \ngenome was called. Experimentally derived haplotypes were used to detect up to 82% of de \nnovo SNVs with a false -positive rate of about one error per gigabase, resulting in fewer than \n10 errors per embryo. The authors state that this represents an approximately 100- fold lower \nerror rate than previously published from 10- cell embryos, and it is the first  demonstration that \nWGS can be used to accurately identify de novo variants in spite of the thousands of false-positive errors introduced by the extensive DNA amplification required for deep sequencing.  \nWES/WGS for Pre natal Fetal Testing \nGirolamo (2023) published a systematic review and meta- analysis to estimate the incremental \nyield of detecting pathogenic or likely pathogenic diagnostic genetic variants (DGV) by whole exome sequencing (WES) over standard karyotype and chromosomal microarray (CMA) analyses in fetuses with isolated increased nuchal translucency (NT) and normal fetal anatomy at the time of 11- 14 weeks scan.\n[74] The secondary outcomes were the detection of a genetic \nvariant of unknown significance. Sub- analysis according to different NT cutoffs (between 3.0 \nand 5.5 mm and > 5.5 mm) and considering fetuses with isolated NT in which fetal anatomy was confirmed to be normal at the anomaly scan were also performed.  Eight articles (324 \nfetuses) were included in the systematic review. Of the fetuses with negative standard karyotype and CMA analysis, the 8.07% (95% CI 5.4 to 11.3) had pathogenic or likely \n\nGT76 | 23 pathogenic genetic variants detected exclusively by WES. When stratifying the analysis \naccording to NT cutoffs, genetic anomalies detected exclusively at WES analysis were found in 44.70% (95% CI 26.8 to 63.4) of fetuses with NT between 3.0 mm and 5.5 mm and 55.3% \n(95% CI 36.6 to 73.2) in those fetuses with NT >5.5 mm and positive WES results. The 7.84% \n(95% CI 1.6 to18.2) had variants of unknown significance identified by WES.  Pathogenic and \nlikely pathogenic genetic variants detected by WES are present in a significant proportion of \nfetuses with increased NT but normal standard karyotype and CMA analysis, also when no anomalies are detected at the anomaly scan. Further large studies sharing objective protocols of imaging assessment are needed to confirm these findings . \nMellis (2022) published a systematic review and meta- analysis of WES for prenatal diagnosis \nof fetal structural anomalies, which included data from 66 studies  and 4, 350 fetuses  that had \nnormal karyotype or CMA testing.\n[75] The incremental diagnostic yield of WES in this setting \nwas reported to be 31% (95% CI 26% to 36% ) and was higher in cases that were pre- selected \nas likely having monogenic disorders (42% vs. 15%). By phenotype, the yield was also higher in cases with skeletal abnormalities (53%) and lowest in cases with isolated increased nuchal translucency (2%).  \nWES/WGS for Pregnancy Loss  \nQiao (2016) evaluated the use of WES to identify genetic causes of idiopathic recurrent early pregnancy loss (RPL), assessing seven euploid miscarriages from four families with RPL.\n[76] \nThe study identified compound heterozygous pathogenic variants of DYNC2H1  and ALOX15  in \ntwo out of four families with RPL. Although the authors concluded that CNVs, individual SNVs and pool of deleterious gene variants identified by exome sequencing could contribute to RPL, they acknowledge that the study has limitations, mainly the small  sample cohort is small and \nthat functional analysis of the candidate variants must be evaluated to determine whether the variants are causative.  \nWHOLE TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING  \nTranscriptome sequencing has been used mainly as a research tool to identify potential \nmarkers for understanding disease pathologies or identifying markers for disease detection. \nLimited clinical studies of transcriptome sequencing have been published. For  example, a \nstudy by Walter (2021) compared whole transcriptome sequencing to WGS in 279 patients \nwith acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; B-cell n=211, T- cell n = 68) .[77] Transcriptome \nsequencing was able to distinguish between B -cell ALL and T- cell ALL based on the \nexpression of 14 markers, and it was used to identify  a number of gene fusions.   \nPRACTICE GUIDELINE SUMMARY \nAMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL GENETICS \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical \npractice guideline for the use of WES and WGS in pediatric patients and made the following recommendation: \"We strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second- tier test \n(guided by clinical judgment and often clinician- patient/family shared decision making after \nCMA or focused testing) for patients with one or more [congenital anomalies]  prior to one year \nof age or for patients with [developmental delay/intellec tual disability]  with onset prior to 18 \nyears of age.\"\n[78] The recommendation was informed by a systematic evidence review and a \nhealth technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.  \n\nGT76 | 24 In 2015, ACMG published a policy statement updating their 2013 their recommendation s for \nanalysis and reporting of secondary/ incidental findings in whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing .[79, 80] \n• The panel states that patients must be made aware, it the time of consent, that \nlaboratories routinely analyze the sequence of a set of genes deemed to be highly medically actionable so as to detect pathogenic variants that may predispose to a severe but preventable disease. \n• Although patients have the choice to opt out of receiving these results, that they should be made aware of the ramifications of doing so.  \nDue to the inherent difficulty of counseling patients about the features of each disorder and every gene deemed actionable by the ACMG, analysis and reporting of secondary findings should apply to the entire list of medically actionable genes, and not a subset.  \nSUMMARY  \nThere is enough research to show that whole exome sequencing (WES) can increase diagnosis rates and improve health outcomes for certain children who are suspected of having a genetic disorder. In some situations, WES testing may prevent the need for more invasive diagnostic tests, such as muscle biopsy. Therefore, WES may be considered \nmedically necessary when policy criteria are met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole exome sequencing (WES) improves health outcomes for patients who do not meet the policy criteria, including adults and individuals with signs and symptoms consistent with a well -known disorder that can be \nidentified by targeted testing. Therefore, WES is considered investigational when policy criteria are not met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) can \nbe used to improve patient health outcomes.  In addition, there are technical limitations such \nas the lack of standardized laboratory procedures, gaps in interpreting ancillary information, and the detection of variants of uncertain significance. Therefore, the use of WGS  is \nconsidered investigational for all indications.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole transcriptome sequencing can be used to improve patient health outcomes.  This technology has been primarily used in the \nresearch setting and there is little evidence regarding its clinical use.  Therefore, whole \ntranscriptome sequencing is considered investigational for all indications.  \nREFERENCES  \n 1. den Dunnen JT, Dalgleish R, Maglott DR, et al.

Results of testing with ES include known pathogenic variants\ndefinitely associated with disease or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).13,14 \nPathogenic variants that can be identified by ES include missense, nonsense, \nsplice-site, and small deletions or insertions.\nAt the present time, ES can fail to detect certain classes of disease-causing \nvariants, such as structural variants (e.g., translocations, inversions), abnormal \nchromosome imprinting or methylation, some mid-size insertions and deletions (ca. \n10-500 bp), trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations, deeper intronic mutations, \nand low-level mosaicism. The current evidence base evaluating ES to specifically \nidentify deletions/duplications is limited, but suggests improved detection in recent \nyears.15 \nES has the advantage of decreased turnaround time and increased efficiency \nrelative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.\nES is associated with technical and analytical variability, including uneven \nsequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, as well as \nvariability in variant classification based on proprietary filtering algorithms and \npotential lack of critical clinical history or family samples.16 \nGuidelines and evidence \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2012) stated the following \nregarding the clinical application of exome and genome testing:17\n\"WGS [whole genome sequencing]/WES should be considered in the clinical \ndiagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:\" \no“The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but \nthe phenotype does not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic \ntest targeting a specific gene is available on a clinical basis.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The current technology does not\nsupport short turnaround times, which are often expected in the prenatal setting.\nThere are high rates of false positives, false negatives, and variants of unknown \nclinical significance. These can be expected to be significantly higher than seen \nwhen array CGH is used in prenatal diagnosis.”  \nThe following were recommended pretest considerations: \no“Pretest counseling should be done by a medical geneticist or an affiliated \ngenetic counselor and should include a formal consent process.”  \no“Before initiating WGS/WES, participants should be counseled regarding the \nexpected outcomes of testing, the likelihood and type of incidental results that \ncould be generated, and what results will or will not be disclosed.”  \no“As part of the pretest counseling, a clear distinction should be made between \nclinical and research-based testing. In many cases, findings will include variants \nof unknown significance that might be the subject for research; in such \ninstances a protocol approved by an institutional review board must be in place \nand appropriate prior informed consent obtained from the participant.”  \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2013) stated the following \nregarding informed consent for exome and genome testing:18\n“Before initiating GS/ES, counseling should be performed by a medical geneticist or\nan affiliated genetic counselor and should include written documentation of consent \nfrom the patient.”  \n“Incidental/secondary findings revealed in either children or adults may have high \nclinical significance for which interventions exist to prevent or ameliorate disease \nseverity. Patients should be informed of this possibility as a part of the informed \nconsent process.”  \n“Pretest counseling should include a discussion of the expected outcomes of \ntesting, the likelihood and type of incidental results that may be generated, and the \ntypes of results that will or will not be returned. Patients should know if and what \ntype of incidental findings may be returned to their referring physician by the \nlaboratory performing the test.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

They stated:19\n“The overall goal of the SFWG [Secondary Findings Working Group] is to \nrecommend a minimum list of genes that places limited excess burden on patients \nand clinical laboratories while maximizing the potential to reduce morbidity and \nmortality when ES/GS is being performed.”  \n“Variants of uncertain significance should not be reported in any gene.”  \n“It is important to reiterate here that use of the SF results should not be a \nreplacement for indication-based diagnostic clinical genetic testing.” \nA table of “ACMG SF v3.0 gene and associated phenotypes recommended for \nreturn as secondary findings from clinical exome and genome sequencing” was \nprovided. ACMG has published updates to this list to expand upon the \nrecommended genes.20,21 \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG, 2020) issued an \neducational Points to Consider Statement addressing good process, benefits, and \nlimitations of using exome sequencing in the prenatal setting.22 \nA 2020 systematic evidence-based review by the ACMG on \"outcomes from exome \nand genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual \ndisability\" stated:23\n\"There is evidence that ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID informs clinical and \nreproductive decision-making, which could lead to improved outcomes for patients \nand their family members.

Since ultrasound and/or MRI imaging is frequently \nlimited, the fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described and \nnew fetal phenotypes for conditions recognized postnatally are now being \nidentified.” \n“There is no universal consensus on the management of IF [incidental findings] and\nSF [secondary findings] and each center should convey their policy detailing \nwhether they are or are not reported, and if reported what is included for parents \nand fetus.” \nData support benefit of prenatal genomic analysis for clinical indications such as \nmultiple congenital anomalies with a negative microarray and previous undiagnosed\nfetus with major or multiple anomalies. Routine prenatal genomic testing (by \nparental request) is not supported by the current body of evidence.\nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis, Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine, \nand Perinatal Quality Foundation \nA joint statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD, 2018), \nthe Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM, 2018), and the Perinatal Quality \nFoundation (PQF, 2018) on prenatal ES stated:29\n“The routine use of prenatal [genome wide] sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot \ncurrently be supported due to insufficient validation data and knowledge about its \nbenefits and pitfalls. Prospective studies with adequate population numbers for \nvalidation are needed…. Currently, it is ideally done in the setting of a research \nprotocol. Alternatively, sequencing may be performed outside a research setting on \na case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected for which a confirmatory\ngenetic diagnosis can be obtained more quickly and accurately by sequencing. \nSuch cases should be managed after consultation with and under the expert \nguidance of genetic professionals working in multidisciplinary teams with expertise \nin the clinical diagnostic application of sequencing, including interpretation of \ngenomic sequencing results and how they translate to the prenatal setting, as well \nas expertise in prenatal imaging and counseling.”  \n“There is currently limited genotype-phenotype correlation for the genetic disorders \nidentified in the fetal period because ultrasound imaging is frequently limited, and \nthe fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

ES \nserves as a powerful diagnostic tool for individuals with rare genetic conditions in which\nthe specific genetic etiology is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup.10,15,30-\n32 \nThe average diagnostic yield of ES is 20-40% depending on the individual's age, \nphenotype, previous workup, and number of comparator samples analyzed.8,11,30,33 \nAmong individuals with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic findings by ES, 5-7% \nreceived a dual molecular diagnosis (i.e., two significant findings associated with \nnon-overlapping clinical presentations).30,33 \nThe use of family trio ES reduces the rate of uncertain findings, adds to the clinical \nsensitivity with regard to the interpretation of clinically novel genes, and increases \nthe diagnostic utility of ES. For example, in three publications the positive rate \nranges from 31-37% in patients undergoing trio analysis compared to 20-23% \npositive rate among proband-only ES.5,30,34,35 \nRe-evaluation of previously obtained exome sequence has the potential for \nadditional diagnostic yield because of constant expansions of existing variant \ndatabases, as well as periodic novel gene discovery.36-38 \nReferences \n1.Shashi V, McConkie-Rosell A, Rosell B, et al The utility of the traditional medical \ngenetics diagnostic evaluation in the context of next-generation sequencing for \nundiagnosed genetic disorders.

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results.

Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history.

Results of testing with ES include known pathogenic variants\ndefinitely associated with disease or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).13,14 \nPathogenic variants that can be identified by ES include missense, nonsense, \nsplice-site, and small deletions or insertions.\nAt the present time, ES can fail to detect certain classes of disease-causing \nvariants, such as structural variants (e.g., translocations, inversions), abnormal \nchromosome imprinting or methylation, some mid-size insertions and deletions (ca. \n10-500 bp), trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations, deeper intronic mutations, \nand low-level mosaicism. The current evidence base evaluating ES to specifically \nidentify deletions/duplications is limited, but suggests improved detection in recent \nyears.15 \nES has the advantage of decreased turnaround time and increased efficiency \nrelative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.\nES is associated with technical and analytical variability, including uneven \nsequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, as well as \nvariability in variant classification based on proprietary filtering algorithms and \npotential lack of critical clinical history or family samples.16 \nGuidelines and evidence \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2012) stated the following \nregarding the clinical application of exome and genome testing:17\n\"WGS [whole genome sequencing]/WES should be considered in the clinical \ndiagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:\" \no“The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but \nthe phenotype does not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic \ntest targeting a specific gene is available on a clinical basis.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The current technology does not\nsupport short turnaround times, which are often expected in the prenatal setting.\nThere are high rates of false positives, false negatives, and variants of unknown \nclinical significance. These can be expected to be significantly higher than seen \nwhen array CGH is used in prenatal diagnosis.”  \nThe following were recommended pretest considerations: \no“Pretest counseling should be done by a medical geneticist or an affiliated \ngenetic counselor and should include a formal consent process.”  \no“Before initiating WGS/WES, participants should be counseled regarding the \nexpected outcomes of testing, the likelihood and type of incidental results that \ncould be generated, and what results will or will not be disclosed.”  \no“As part of the pretest counseling, a clear distinction should be made between \nclinical and research-based testing. In many cases, findings will include variants \nof unknown significance that might be the subject for research; in such \ninstances a protocol approved by an institutional review board must be in place \nand appropriate prior informed consent obtained from the participant.”  \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2013) stated the following \nregarding informed consent for exome and genome testing:18\n“Before initiating GS/ES, counseling should be performed by a medical geneticist or\nan affiliated genetic counselor and should include written documentation of consent \nfrom the patient.”  \n“Incidental/secondary findings revealed in either children or adults may have high \nclinical significance for which interventions exist to prevent or ameliorate disease \nseverity. Patients should be informed of this possibility as a part of the informed \nconsent process.”  \n“Pretest counseling should include a discussion of the expected outcomes of \ntesting, the likelihood and type of incidental results that may be generated, and the \ntypes of results that will or will not be returned. Patients should know if and what \ntype of incidental findings may be returned to their referring physician by the \nlaboratory performing the test.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

They stated:19\n“The overall goal of the SFWG [Secondary Findings Working Group] is to \nrecommend a minimum list of genes that places limited excess burden on patients \nand clinical laboratories while maximizing the potential to reduce morbidity and \nmortality when ES/GS is being performed.”  \n“Variants of uncertain significance should not be reported in any gene.”  \n“It is important to reiterate here that use of the SF results should not be a \nreplacement for indication-based diagnostic clinical genetic testing.” \nA table of “ACMG SF v3.0 gene and associated phenotypes recommended for \nreturn as secondary findings from clinical exome and genome sequencing” was \nprovided. ACMG has published updates to this list to expand upon the \nrecommended genes.20,21 \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG, 2020) issued an \neducational Points to Consider Statement addressing good process, benefits, and \nlimitations of using exome sequencing in the prenatal setting.22 \nA 2020 systematic evidence-based review by the ACMG on \"outcomes from exome \nand genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual \ndisability\" stated:23\n\"There is evidence that ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID informs clinical and \nreproductive decision-making, which could lead to improved outcomes for patients \nand their family members.

Since ultrasound and/or MRI imaging is frequently \nlimited, the fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described and \nnew fetal phenotypes for conditions recognized postnatally are now being \nidentified.” \n“There is no universal consensus on the management of IF [incidental findings] and\nSF [secondary findings] and each center should convey their policy detailing \nwhether they are or are not reported, and if reported what is included for parents \nand fetus.” \nData support benefit of prenatal genomic analysis for clinical indications such as \nmultiple congenital anomalies with a negative microarray and previous undiagnosed\nfetus with major or multiple anomalies. Routine prenatal genomic testing (by \nparental request) is not supported by the current body of evidence.\nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis, Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine, \nand Perinatal Quality Foundation \nA joint statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD, 2018), \nthe Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM, 2018), and the Perinatal Quality \nFoundation (PQF, 2018) on prenatal ES stated:29\n“The routine use of prenatal [genome wide] sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot \ncurrently be supported due to insufficient validation data and knowledge about its \nbenefits and pitfalls. Prospective studies with adequate population numbers for \nvalidation are needed…. Currently, it is ideally done in the setting of a research \nprotocol. Alternatively, sequencing may be performed outside a research setting on \na case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected for which a confirmatory\ngenetic diagnosis can be obtained more quickly and accurately by sequencing. \nSuch cases should be managed after consultation with and under the expert \nguidance of genetic professionals working in multidisciplinary teams with expertise \nin the clinical diagnostic application of sequencing, including interpretation of \ngenomic sequencing results and how they translate to the prenatal setting, as well \nas expertise in prenatal imaging and counseling.”  \n“There is currently limited genotype-phenotype correlation for the genetic disorders \nidentified in the fetal period because ultrasound imaging is frequently limited, and \nthe fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

ES \nserves as a powerful diagnostic tool for individuals with rare genetic conditions in which\nthe specific genetic etiology is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup.10,15,30-\n32 \nThe average diagnostic yield of ES is 20-40% depending on the individual's age, \nphenotype, previous workup, and number of comparator samples analyzed.8,11,30,33 \nAmong individuals with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic findings by ES, 5-7% \nreceived a dual molecular diagnosis (i.e., two significant findings associated with \nnon-overlapping clinical presentations).30,33 \nThe use of family trio ES reduces the rate of uncertain findings, adds to the clinical \nsensitivity with regard to the interpretation of clinically novel genes, and increases \nthe diagnostic utility of ES. For example, in three publications the positive rate \nranges from 31-37% in patients undergoing trio analysis compared to 20-23% \npositive rate among proband-only ES.5,30,34,35 \nRe-evaluation of previously obtained exome sequence has the potential for \nadditional diagnostic yield because of constant expansions of existing variant \ndatabases, as well as periodic novel gene discovery.36-38 \nReferences \n1.Shashi V, McConkie-Rosell A, Rosell B, et al The utility of the traditional medical \ngenetics diagnostic evaluation in the context of next-generation sequencing for \nundiagnosed genetic disorders.

strongly recommended prior to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) or Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in order to inform persons being tested about the advantages and limitations of the test as applied to their unique \nsituation.  \n WES refers to the sequence determination of the exome. The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that \nencodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome.  (Chung, 2023)  \n \nMost known disease- causing variants are found in the exons, and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient \nanalysis can be completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016) . WES results in long lists \nof genetic variants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify \ndisease causing mutations . (Richards et al., 2015)  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome.  (MedlinePlus , 2020b) . This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions , and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023).  As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and  focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years . \n(Taber et al., 2015)  \n Another type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid (RNA). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transc ribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the \ncollective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA present in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology indications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM), uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at spec ific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications (Mantere et al., 2021). OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n Chung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases. The meta-analysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations over a period of 10 years (2011- 2021). Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility (defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes t o clinical management following a diagnosis by ES or GS), \nrates of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from ES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies and evaluated. The analysi s revealed comparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36- 0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall, and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35- 0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I\n2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%). Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES (2- 579 for GS vs 1- 75 for ES), but the rate of VUS was not significantly different ( p = .78). Of the \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n nine studies (2,269 probands) that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times greater than ES \n(95% CI 0.79- 1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With respect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results. Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% - 16%. A signific ant difference in the diagn ostic rate between ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2,361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40- 0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta-\nanalysis. Additionally, of ten QUADAS -2 assessed, high- quality studies (2,170 probands) reporting on clinical utility, GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30- 0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant published literature. Twenty studies, including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES  and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA, met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was potential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta- regression. Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of  the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%), and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals with short stature and provide a strong base of reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes, which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals.  \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS, for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies su pporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals with this disorder. Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of individuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023)  Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES  or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low - quality evidence was found for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified. Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis. Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately 37 art icles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affected famil y members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unexplained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by  Ewans  et al.  (2018) and Bowling  et al.  (2017), previously discussed  in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used in 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \nwere epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secon dary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS was performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year, and for those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undiagnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use of genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD. The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay (DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for this study, which took pl ace in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. They found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine experienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to \nhigh diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s participants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid- 2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative included COL2A1  (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies ( n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2- 22%). For WGS, outcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes; Hayes notes that additional studies evaluating both larger numbers and a broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n \nAn additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did does not address ID in individuals  with other disorders including NDD or global DD, which are discussed in separate Hayes reports. No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies and subtypes of NDD, Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing (NGS) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel sequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and \n28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was \nnot statically significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p =  .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found in this review compared to previous studies. The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; this systematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. In addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy, and this review included panel -based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were included. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, th is study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy, Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral palsy; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare- based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years and the health care- based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort (predominantly pediatric), molecular diagnostic yield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort (predominantly adult), it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participan ts and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts. Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for sequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care- based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized tria l incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days). The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 day s (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants \nwere racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that twice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group receive d a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed group at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study, however, showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical \nmanagement and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for criti cally ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretati on of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a lower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined in this study.  \n In a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who \nwere recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequ encing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, \nophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rhe umatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for cases with etiologic noncoding, structural and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for clinical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical outcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Malinowski et al. (2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS. \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy. Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was identified. Ultimately, 167 articles were i ncluded; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly al l included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision- making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by St ark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al. (2016), Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al.  \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Malinowski et al. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 participants that were extensively ph enotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare \ndiseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolomics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of ad ults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately \n6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to  aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020) examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASDs  (n = 4), DD/ID ( n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting. A total of  37 pathogenic /likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals  (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the \nSNVs identified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3%. For the individuals that had positive results, \n36.7% and 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals  \nwith DD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their cohort \ncompared to traditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that t hey also achieved their secondary objectives \nof decreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluations) addressed ES for use in individuals with (NDDs). \nThe study included a meta- analysis and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES \nwith that of CMA in affected individuals. The study defined NDD as global DD, ID and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles \naddressing diagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of \nES was 36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions), which is substantially greater \nthan previous studies focused on CMA (15- 20%). The researchers conclude that the study showed consistently better \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have been less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneous cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing. Publications by  Vissers et al.  (2017), Tarailo- Graovac  et al.  (2016), Retterer  et al.  \n(2016) , and Lee  et al.  (2014), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in the Srivastava systematic review and \nmeta- analysis.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 11 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Groopman et al. (2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 \nyears of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnostic resul t in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionabl e findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score and standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and \nfor the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes. In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) w ere found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome analysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes, however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH -funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none of which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance \nrate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malformations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub- group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early \nintervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome,  type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset  disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and  were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT  and G6PD . Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could impact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines arise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by fact ors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond that currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.   \n In order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was 2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were \nfound, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n As part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield. In some cases, family testing was performed to \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 12 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n determine gene segregation and verify pathogenicity. The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent specialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary spastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n Bardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical \nindications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing for Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes \nwere selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in \n52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platforms or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the involvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.   \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August \n2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta‐ analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utilit y of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of WES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WGS and WES was not significantly different. In studies with in-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference lab interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statisticall y significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnosti c rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be considered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n \nThe diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One B RCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a \nchange in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/601, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non- sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling for variant discussion.  \n \nAnother study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a \ncohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioRe source Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality was poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate varied by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individua ls had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that \nthe WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection rate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 –5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from consan guineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A, PPOX, FRMPD4, and SCN1B, and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a fi rst-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics ’ laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n neurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening  \nA 2023 systematic review and meta- analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Seco ndary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 47%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9- 24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27- 51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time for CMA/WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended.  Publications by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies \nwhere CMA had been negative. Testing took place between the 12th and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded ( n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm). For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence variation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was \n40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS, related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply. The researchers assert that although this \nstudy  is limited by small sample size, the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use.  \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies w ere included in this review, representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled incremental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre- selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases ( 42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these \nresults, the researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a di agnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with \nstructural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending \non the body system impacted and can be increased by specific pre- selection of cases after a  multi- disciplinary review \nindicating likelihood of a monogenic cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies \nthat were evaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of analysis which likely impact diagnostic yield  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of \nprenatal ES to gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritize cases for testing and the challenges that exist for interpreting variants w ith incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding \nphenotype. Publications by  Chen et al.  (2020), Deden et al.  (2020), Lord et al.  (2019), Petrovski  et al.  (2019) , Aarabi  et al.  \n(2018),  Fu et al.  (2018) , and Normand et al.  (2018), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in this systematic \nreview.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 15 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were obtained prior to exome analysis. After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely path ogenic variants were \nidentified that were de termined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progressed. The authors \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogeni c variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta- analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies) with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yield of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these, 42% of variants were \nhomozygous. Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appe ar to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndromes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon.  \n \nA 2020 (updated 2023 ) Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS related to \nimprovement of diagnosis and assistance with pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are \ndetected by ultrasound or other testing is lacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for the use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologi c diseases. Specifically, relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions and deletions and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP). This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals, 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels. Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platform used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals, which, according to their referring clinicians, would ena ble \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to lead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to efficient re analysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n In an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children  \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \nundiagnosed c hildren who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re- evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of better bioinformatic pipelines, improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification of previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact  the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. The study showed that not all afflicted individuals will undergo routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey, \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting and considered all di sease- related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new di agnoses, however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The \nliterature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examined 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two years of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new \ndiagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs. The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n \nAlfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of WES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton \nsystem. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs may  not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the study and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclusive WES results. Most were male (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patien ts \nhad complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS results with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because the data that demonstrated their pathogenicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original \nraw data files were not available from this lab to determin e if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four \nvariants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re- analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n and the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of positives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n \nTo evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis, Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date soft ware and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnosti c exomes. This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 –3-year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of relat ionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround- times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinical utility of these rapid and ult ra-rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra -rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), \ndiscussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gu bbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nDimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed had cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in \nGenomic Medicine and  Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). \nThe goal of the NSIGHT study was to comp are two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two \ninterpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who \nreceived urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra-\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 \nhours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. O f the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, respectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n urWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0.0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \nwere randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, cr itically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to l ess seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of bot h tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with undiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30- 50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. Sanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings outside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n \nClark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a provisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the \nmean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four timed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling took \na median of 1 hour and is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant variants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and \noptimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and l ogical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was selected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospecti vely in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with t wo children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the \nprior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously il l infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 hours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger sequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Whole Transcriptome Sequencing  \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS. The results of RNAseq were combined with gen ome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional seven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels, and SVs were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 samples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7– 27%), bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29 –48%). The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of RNAseq. The study was limited by its small cohort size which underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center, \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional \nstudies on broader populations and focused on improv ement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication. Although it shows early promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, further development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential clinical \nutility.  \n Mantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities in a proof -of-principle study. In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra- high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM. The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not ( n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders ( n = 15), family history of chromosome abnormality ( n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound ( n = \n9). The result was compared to known anomalies obtained via current standard- of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities. They foresee continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- quality clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n \nAdditional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications . (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023)  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified \nthrough routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available. Evidence \nLevel C . (Kang et al., 2015, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 20 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nIn an AANEM 2016 consensus statement, the group stated that while they do not endorse or recommend a specific \ntesting methodology, genetic testing to establish a molecular diagnosis is a crucial step in providing optimal care to \nindividuals with neuromuscular disorders . (Kassardjian et al., 2016, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \nIn a 2021 practice guideline authored by Manickam et al., the ACMG asserts their position that evidenced- based literature \nsupports clinical utility of whole exome and whole genome sequencing on both active and long- term management of \nindividuals with congenital anomalies, developmental delay and intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). Based on their comprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first - or second - tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of standard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0 (Miller et al., 2021b), contained 73 genes and detailed the way that genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list (v3.1); a total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR  (hereditary TTR amyloidosis). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome), bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n Monaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health- care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be obtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n A 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test results. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re- evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory work collaboratively in the testing process.”  \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significance,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the i nterpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole-\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”   \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021) addressing the management of stillbirth indicates that whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023)  Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances (e.g., fetuses with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific  genes of  clinical interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances, WES or WGS  may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG, and Horizon 2020 project Solve- RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases using various analytical techniques. The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, \nefficiency and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed \nin accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal anomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple organ system anomalies ; and \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies ; and \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a fetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline . \n \nThe guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or neurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and \ncomprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)  \nIn a 2022 evidence- based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology. The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing, followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider \nin the context of appropriate pre-  and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n \nThis section is to be used for informational purposes only.

strongly recommended prior to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) or Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in order to inform persons being tested about the advantages and limitations of the test as applied to their unique \nsituation.  \n WES refers to the sequence determination of the exome. The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that \nencodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome.  (Chung, 2023)  \n \nMost known disease- causing variants are found in the exons, and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient \nanalysis can be completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016) . WES results in long lists \nof genetic variants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify \ndisease causing mutations . (Richards et al., 2015)  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome.  (MedlinePlus , 2020b) . This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions , and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023).  As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and  focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years . \n(Taber et al., 2015)  \n Another type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid (RNA). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transc ribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the \ncollective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA present in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology indications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM), uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at spec ific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications (Mantere et al., 2021). OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n Chung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases. The meta-analysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations over a period of 10 years (2011- 2021). Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility (defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes t o clinical management following a diagnosis by ES or GS), \nrates of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from ES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies and evaluated. The analysi s revealed comparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36- 0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall, and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35- 0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I\n2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%). Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES (2- 579 for GS vs 1- 75 for ES), but the rate of VUS was not significantly different ( p = .78). Of the \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n nine studies (2,269 probands) that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times greater than ES \n(95% CI 0.79- 1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With respect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results. Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% - 16%. A signific ant difference in the diagn ostic rate between ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2,361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40- 0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta-\nanalysis. Additionally, of ten QUADAS -2 assessed, high- quality studies (2,170 probands) reporting on clinical utility, GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30- 0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis of relevant published literature. Twenty studies, including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES  and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA, met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was potential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta- regression. Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of  the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%), and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals with short stature and provide a strong base of reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes, which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals.  \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS, for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies su pporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals with this disorder. Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of individuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023)  Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES  or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low - quality evidence was found for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified. Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis. Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately 37 art icles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affected famil y members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unexplained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by  Ewans  et al.  (2018) and Bowling  et al.  (2017), previously discussed  in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used in 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \nwere epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secon dary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS was performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year, and for those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undiagnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use of genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD. The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay (DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for this study, which took pl ace in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. They found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine experienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to \nhigh diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s participants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid- 2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative included COL2A1  (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies ( n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2- 22%). For WGS, outcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes; Hayes notes that additional studies evaluating both larger numbers and a broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n \nAn additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did does not address ID in individuals  with other disorders including NDD or global DD, which are discussed in separate Hayes reports. No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies and subtypes of NDD, Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing (NGS) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel sequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and \n28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was \nnot statically significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p =  .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found in this review compared to previous studies. The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; this systematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. In addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy, and this review included panel -based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were included. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, th is study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy, Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral palsy; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare- based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years and the health care- based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort (predominantly pediatric), molecular diagnostic yield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort (predominantly adult), it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participan ts and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts. Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for sequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care- based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized tria l incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days). The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 day s (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants \nwere racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that twice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group receive d a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed group at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study, however, showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical \nmanagement and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for criti cally ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretati on of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a lower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined in this study.  \n In a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing in individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who \nwere recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequ encing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, \nophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rhe umatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for cases with etiologic noncoding, structural and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for clinical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical outcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Malinowski et al. (2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS. \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy. Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was identified. Ultimately, 167 articles were i ncluded; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly al l included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision- making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by St ark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al. (2016), Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al.  \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Malinowski et al. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 participants that were extensively ph enotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare \ndiseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolomics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of ad ults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately \n6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to  aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020) examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASDs  (n = 4), DD/ID ( n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting. A total of  37 pathogenic /likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals  (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the \nSNVs identified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3%. For the individuals that had positive results, \n36.7% and 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals  \nwith DD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their cohort \ncompared to traditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that t hey also achieved their secondary objectives \nof decreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluations) addressed ES for use in individuals with (NDDs). \nThe study included a meta- analysis and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES \nwith that of CMA in affected individuals. The study defined NDD as global DD, ID and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles \naddressing diagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of \nES was 36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions), which is substantially greater \nthan previous studies focused on CMA (15- 20%). The researchers conclude that the study showed consistently better \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have been less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneous cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing. Publications by  Vissers et al.  (2017), Tarailo- Graovac  et al.  (2016), Retterer  et al.  \n(2016) , and Lee  et al.  (2014), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in the Srivastava systematic review and \nmeta- analysis.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 11 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Groopman et al. (2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 \nyears of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnostic resul t in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionabl e findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score and standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and \nfor the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes. In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) w ere found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome analysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes, however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH -funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none of which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance \nrate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malformations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub- group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early \nintervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome,  type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset  disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and  were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT  and G6PD . Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could impact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines arise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by fact ors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond that currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.   \n In order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was 2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were \nfound, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n As part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield. In some cases, family testing was performed to \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 12 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n determine gene segregation and verify pathogenicity. The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent specialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary spastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n Bardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical \nindications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing for Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes \nwere selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in \n52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platforms or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the involvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.   \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August \n2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta‐ analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utilit y of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of WES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WGS and WES was not significantly different. In studies with in-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference lab interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statisticall y significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnosti c rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be considered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n \nThe diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One B RCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a \nchange in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/601, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non- sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling for variant discussion.  \n \nAnother study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a \ncohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioRe source Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality was poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate varied by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individua ls had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that \nthe WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection rate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 –5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from consan guineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A, PPOX, FRMPD4, and SCN1B, and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a fi rst-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics ’ laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n neurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening  \nA 2023 systematic review and meta- analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Seco ndary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 47%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9- 24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27- 51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time for CMA/WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended.  Publications by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies \nwhere CMA had been negative. Testing took place between the 12th and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded ( n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm). For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence variation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was \n40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS, related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply. The researchers assert that although this \nstudy  is limited by small sample size, the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use.  \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies w ere included in this review, representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled incremental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre- selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases ( 42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these \nresults, the researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a di agnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with \nstructural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending \non the body system impacted and can be increased by specific pre- selection of cases after a  multi- disciplinary review \nindicating likelihood of a monogenic cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies \nthat were evaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of analysis which likely impact diagnostic yield  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of \nprenatal ES to gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritize cases for testing and the challenges that exist for interpreting variants w ith incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding \nphenotype. Publications by  Chen et al.  (2020), Deden et al.  (2020), Lord et al.  (2019), Petrovski  et al.  (2019) , Aarabi  et al.  \n(2018),  Fu et al.  (2018) , and Normand et al.  (2018), previously discussed  in this policy, were included in this systematic \nreview.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 15 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were obtained prior to exome analysis. After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely path ogenic variants were \nidentified that were de termined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progressed. The authors \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogeni c variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta- analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies) with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yield of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these, 42% of variants were \nhomozygous. Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appe ar to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndromes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon.  \n \nA 2020 (updated 2023 ) Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS related to \nimprovement of diagnosis and assistance with pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are \ndetected by ultrasound or other testing is lacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for the use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologi c diseases. Specifically, relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions and deletions and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP). This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals, 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels. Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platform used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals, which, according to their referring clinicians, would ena ble \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to lead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to efficient re analysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n In an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children  \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \nundiagnosed c hildren who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re- evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of better bioinformatic pipelines, improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification of previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact  the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. The study showed that not all afflicted individuals will undergo routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey, \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting and considered all di sease- related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new di agnoses, however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The \nliterature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examined 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two years of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new \ndiagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs. The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n \nAlfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of WES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton \nsystem. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs may  not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the study and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclusive WES results. Most were male (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patien ts \nhad complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS results with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because the data that demonstrated their pathogenicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original \nraw data files were not available from this lab to determin e if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four \nvariants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re- analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n and the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of positives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n \nTo evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis, Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date soft ware and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnosti c exomes. This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 –3-year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of relat ionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround- times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinical utility of these rapid and ult ra-rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra -rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), \ndiscussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gu bbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nDimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed had cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in \nGenomic Medicine and  Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). \nThe goal of the NSIGHT study was to comp are two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two \ninterpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who \nreceived urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra-\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 \nhours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. O f the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, respectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n urWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0.0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \nwere randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, cr itically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to l ess seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of bot h tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with undiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30- 50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. Sanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings outside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n \nClark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a provisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the \nmean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four timed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling took \na median of 1 hour and is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant variants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and \noptimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and l ogical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was selected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospecti vely in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with t wo children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the \nprior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously il l infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 hours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger sequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n Whole Transcriptome Sequencing  \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS. The results of RNAseq were combined with gen ome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional seven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels, and SVs were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 samples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7– 27%), bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29 –48%). The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of RNAseq. The study was limited by its small cohort size which underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center, \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional \nstudies on broader populations and focused on improv ement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication. Although it shows early promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, further development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential clinical \nutility.  \n Mantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities in a proof -of-principle study. In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra- high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM. The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not ( n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders ( n = 15), family history of chromosome abnormality ( n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound ( n = \n9). The result was compared to known anomalies obtained via current standard- of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities. They foresee continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- quality clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n \nAdditional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications . (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023)  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified \nthrough routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available. Evidence \nLevel C . (Kang et al., 2015, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 20 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nIn an AANEM 2016 consensus statement, the group stated that while they do not endorse or recommend a specific \ntesting methodology, genetic testing to establish a molecular diagnosis is a crucial step in providing optimal care to \nindividuals with neuromuscular disorders . (Kassardjian et al., 2016, reaffirmed 2021)  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \nIn a 2021 practice guideline authored by Manickam et al., the ACMG asserts their position that evidenced- based literature \nsupports clinical utility of whole exome and whole genome sequencing on both active and long- term management of \nindividuals with congenital anomalies, developmental delay and intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). Based on their comprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first - or second - tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of standard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0 (Miller et al., 2021b), contained 73 genes and detailed the way that genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list (v3.1); a total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR  (hereditary TTR amyloidosis). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome), bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n Monaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health- care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be obtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n A 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test results. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re- evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory work collaboratively in the testing process.”  \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significance,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the i nterpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole-\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”   \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021) addressing the management of stillbirth indicates that whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023)  Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances (e.g., fetuses with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific  genes of  clinical interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances, WES or WGS  may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG, and Horizon 2020 project Solve- RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases using various analytical techniques. The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, \nefficiency and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed \nin accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal anomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple organ system anomalies ; and \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies ; and \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a fetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Oxford Clinical  Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \n©1996 -202 5, Oxford Health Plans, LLC  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline . \n \nThe guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or neurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and \ncomprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)  \nIn a 2022 evidence- based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology. The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing, followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider \nin the context of appropriate pre-  and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n \nThis section is to be used for informational purposes only.

Results of testing with ES include known pathogenic variants\ndefinitely associated with disease or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).13,14 \nPathogenic variants that can be identified by ES include missense, nonsense, \nsplice-site, and small deletions or insertions.\nAt the present time, ES can fail to detect certain classes of disease-causing \nvariants, such as structural variants (e.g., translocations, inversions), abnormal \nchromosome imprinting or methylation, some mid-size insertions and deletions (ca. \n10-500 bp), trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations, deeper intronic mutations, \nand low-level mosaicism. The current evidence base evaluating ES to specifically \nidentify deletions/duplications is limited, but suggests improved detection in recent \nyears.15 \nES has the advantage of decreased turnaround time and increased efficiency \nrelative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.\nES is associated with technical and analytical variability, including uneven \nsequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, as well as \nvariability in variant classification based on proprietary filtering algorithms and \npotential lack of critical clinical history or family samples.16 \nGuidelines and evidence \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2012) stated the following \nregarding the clinical application of exome and genome testing:17\n\"WGS [whole genome sequencing]/WES should be considered in the clinical \ndiagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:\" \no“The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but \nthe phenotype does not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic \ntest targeting a specific gene is available on a clinical basis.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The current technology does not\nsupport short turnaround times, which are often expected in the prenatal setting.\nThere are high rates of false positives, false negatives, and variants of unknown \nclinical significance. These can be expected to be significantly higher than seen \nwhen array CGH is used in prenatal diagnosis.”  \nThe following were recommended pretest considerations: \no“Pretest counseling should be done by a medical geneticist or an affiliated \ngenetic counselor and should include a formal consent process.”  \no“Before initiating WGS/WES, participants should be counseled regarding the \nexpected outcomes of testing, the likelihood and type of incidental results that \ncould be generated, and what results will or will not be disclosed.”  \no“As part of the pretest counseling, a clear distinction should be made between \nclinical and research-based testing. In many cases, findings will include variants \nof unknown significance that might be the subject for research; in such \ninstances a protocol approved by an institutional review board must be in place \nand appropriate prior informed consent obtained from the participant.”  \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2013) stated the following \nregarding informed consent for exome and genome testing:18\n“Before initiating GS/ES, counseling should be performed by a medical geneticist or\nan affiliated genetic counselor and should include written documentation of consent \nfrom the patient.”  \n“Incidental/secondary findings revealed in either children or adults may have high \nclinical significance for which interventions exist to prevent or ameliorate disease \nseverity. Patients should be informed of this possibility as a part of the informed \nconsent process.”  \n“Pretest counseling should include a discussion of the expected outcomes of \ntesting, the likelihood and type of incidental results that may be generated, and the \ntypes of results that will or will not be returned. Patients should know if and what \ntype of incidental findings may be returned to their referring physician by the \nlaboratory performing the test.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Prospective studies with adequate population numbers for \nvalidation are needed…. Currently, it is ideally done in the setting of a research \nprotocol. Alternatively, sequencing may be performed outside a research setting on \na case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected for which a confirmatory\ngenetic diagnosis can be obtained more quickly and accurately by sequencing. \nSuch cases should be managed after consultation with and under the expert \nguidance of genetic professionals working in multidisciplinary teams with expertise \nin the clinical diagnostic application of sequencing, including interpretation of \ngenomic sequencing results and how they translate to the prenatal setting, as well \nas expertise in prenatal imaging and counseling.”  \n“There is currently limited genotype-phenotype correlation for the genetic disorders \nidentified in the fetal period because ultrasound imaging is frequently limited, and \nthe fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Benefit determinations are based in all cases on the applicable contract \nlanguage. To the extent there may be any conflict between the Medical Policy and contract language, the contract \nlanguage takes precedence.  \nPLEASE NOTE: Contracts exclude from coverage, among other things, services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers may bill members for services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers are e ncouraged to inform members before rendering such \nservices that the members are likely to be financially responsible for the cost of these services.  \n \nDESCRIPTION  \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is defined as targeted sequencing of the subset of the human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein- coding DNA.  Whole \ngenome sequencing (WGS) uses next -generation sequencing techniques to sequence both \ncoding- and non- coding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed to be \nmore efficient than traditional sequencing methods in discovering the genetic causes of diseases  and other indications . \nMEDICAL POLICY CRITERIA  \n \nNote:  This policy does not address tumor tissue or cell -free DNA testing for targeted \ntreatment of cancer (see Cross References  section ). \nI. Whole exome sequencing may be considered medically necessary for the evaluation \nof unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in pediatric patients (age 17 \nyears and younger) when all of the following criteria (A. – C.) are met:  \nA. The patient has had a clinical evaluation and has been informed about the \npotential risks of genetic testing; and \nB. There is clinical documentation that  whole exome sequencing results will guide \ndecisions for medical management; and \nC. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the patient’s \n\n\nGT76 | 2 phenotype, and one of the following is met:  \n1. The clinical presentation is not consistent with a well -described genetic \nsyndrome for which targeted genetic testing is available; or  \n2. Previous targeted genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis and whole \nexome sequencing may prevent the need for  invasive procedures as the next \ndiagnostic step (e.g. , muscle biopsy) .  \nII. Whole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic \ndisorders when Criterion I. is not met, including but not limited to prenatal or \npreimplantation testing.  \nIII. Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \nIV. Whole transcriptome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \n \nNOTE: A summary of the supporting rationale for the policy criteria is at the end of the policy.  \nLIST OF INFORMATION NEEDED FOR REVIEW  \nSUBMISSION OF GENETIC TESTING DOCUMENTATION \nAll of the following information must be submitted for review prior to the genetic testing:  \n• Name of genetic test(s)  and/or panel test   \n• Name of performing laboratory and/or genetic testing organization (more than one may \nbe listed)  \n• Date of blood draw or sample collection  \n• Relevant billing codes  \n• Brief description of how the genetic test results will guide clinical decisions that would \nnot otherwise be made in the absence of testing \n• Clinical d ocumentation that the risks of testing have been discussed \nCROSS REFERENCES  \n1.

It is being implemented for genetic testing \nmedical evidence review updates starting in 2017. According to this nomenclature, the term “variant” is used to describe a change in a DNA or protein sequence, repl acing previously \nused terms, such as “mutation.” Pathogenic variants are variants associated with disease, \nwhile benign variants are not. The majority of genetic changes have unknown effects on human health, and these are referred to as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) . \nCurrently available clinical assays designed for the molecular diagnosis of rare Mendelian diseases are incomplete. This is due to genetic heterogeneity, the presence of unknown \ncausative genes, and because only a portion of the known genes and variant s can be \nefficiently tested using conventional molecular methods. Recently, next -generation sequencing \n(NGS)  technologies have become more accessible in terms of cost and speed and have been \nadopted by a growing number of molecular genetic clinical laboratories.  \nDepending on the disorder and the degree of genetic and clinical heterogeneity, the current \ndiagnostic pathway for patients with suspected genetic disorders accompanied by multiple anomalies may depend on various combinations of low -yield radiographic, \nelectrophysiological, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic evaluations.\n[2] The search for a \ndiagnosis may thus become a time- consuming and expensive process. When a disease-\ncausing gene(s) is established, assays based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  technology, \nfor example, can be designed to specifically detect known variant s for clinical diagnosis. When \nmany different single -nucleotide variants (SNVs)  in a gene are possible, Sanger sequencing, \nthe current gold standard for detecting unknown SNVs , can be employed to determine the \nentire sequence of the coding and intron/exon splice sites of gene regions where variant s are \nmost likely to be found. However, when genes are large and variant s are possible in many or \nall exons (protein- coding regions of the gene), and when there is genetic (locus) heterogeneity, \ncomprehensive Sanger sequencing may be prohibitively laborious and costly.  \nWES using NGS technology is a relatively new approach to obtaining a genetic diagnosis in \npatients more efficiently compared with traditional methods. Exome sequencing has the capacity to determine an individual’s exomic variation profile in a single assay. This profile is \nlimited to most of the protein coding sequence of an individual (approximately 85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons, and constitutes approximately 1% of the whole genome. It is believed that the exome contains about 85% of heritable disease- causing \nvariant s. \nPublished studies have show n that exome sequencing can be used to detect previously \nannotated pathogenic variant s and reveal new likely pathogenic variant s in known and \nunknown genes. A limited number of studies have reported that the diagnostic yield of exome \nsequencing  appears to be significantly increased above that of traditional Sanger sequencing, \nwhile  also being faster and more efficien t relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.  \nWGS uses similar techniques to WES but involves the sequencing of noncoding DNA in addition to the protein- coding segments of the genome.  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing involves the use of NGS to sequence RNA molecules instead of DNA.  \nLIMITATIONS OF WES  AND WGS \n\nGT76 | 4 At this time, the limitations of WES  and WGS  include technical and implementation challenges. \nThere are issues of error rates due to uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture prior \nto sequencing, and difficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without losing likely candidate variant s. It is difficult to filter and interpret \npotential causative variants from the large number of variants of unknown significance (VUS)  \ngenerated for each patient. Variant databases are poorly annotated, and algorithms for annotating variants will need to be automated. Existing databases that catalog variants and putative disease associations are known to have significant entry error rates.  \nApproaches for characterizing the functional impact of rare and novel variants (i.e., achieving full-genome clinical interpretations that are scientifically sound and medically relevant) have to \nbe improved. The variability contributed by the different platforms and procedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service is unknown, and detailed guidance from regulatory and professional organizations is still under development. Finally, exome sequencing has some similar limitations as Sanger sequencing and will not \nidentify the following: intronic sequences or gene regulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions, duplications or rearrangements within genes; nucleotide repeats; or epigenetic changes. WGS address some of these limitations but is limited by the need for increased analytic power and the likelihood of greater identification of VUS. \nThere are also ethical questions about reporting incidental findings such as identifying \nmedically relevant variant s in genes unrelated to the diagnostic question, sex chromosome \nabnormalities, and non- paternity when family studies are performed. Standards for the \nrequired components of informed consent before WES/WGS is performed have been proposed and include a description of confidentiality and a description of how incidental findings will be managed.\n[3] Methods of reporting findings from WES/WGS are in development. \nFor example, McLaughlin et al, reporting on the MedSeq Project which is testing methods for evaluating and reporting WES/WGS data, described the development of a genome report that highlights results  that are significant to the indication being evaluated.\n[4] \nRESULTS OF TESTING WITH WES/WGS[5] \n1. A variant known to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• This is a sequence variant that has been shown through prior genetic and clinical research to cause a disease.  \n2. A variant suspected to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• Most variants detected by WES sequencing are uncharacterized and some are \nnovel (i.e., never known to have been observed in a human sample). Some variants \nallow for relatively easy and accurate clinical interpretation; however, for most there is little dat a on which to base an assessment of causality. Tools to facilitate the \nassessment of causality include bioinformatic analyses, predicted structural changes, and others. While these tools may be useful, their predictive power is highly variable. In addition, each clinical laboratory offering WES/WGS testing have their own “in- house” algorithm to facilitate assessment and classification of these \nvariants.  \n\nGT76 | 5 3. A variant of uncertain significance (VOUS/VUS)  is identified.   \n• Among the known 30,000 to 40,000 variants that reside in the protein- coding \nportions of the genome, the typical subject will have three to eight  actionable \nvariants. (Most relate to reproductive risks, i .e., heterozygous carrier alleles.) But the \nremaining thousands are either highly likely to be benign or of uncertain clinical \nsignificance. It can be equally as challenging to prove that a variant is benign as it is to prove it is pathogenic. Currently, nearly all variants among the tens of thousands must b e considered of uncertain significance.   \nAVAILABLE TESTING SERVICES  \nWES  \nExamples of some laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service and their \nindications for testing are summarized in the table below.  \nLaboratory  Laboratory indications for testing \nAmbry Genetics  “The patient's clinical presentation is unclear/atypical disease and there are \nmultiple genetic conditions in the differential diagnosis.”  \nGeneDx  “a patient with a diagnosis that suggests the involvement of one or more of many different genes, which would, if even available and sequenced individually, be prohibitively expensive”  \nBaylor College of Medicine “used when a patient’s medical history and physical exam findings strongly \nsuggest that there is an underlying genetic etiology. In some cases, the \npatient may have had an extensive evaluation consisting of multiple genetic tests, without identifying an etiology.” Baylor also offers a prenatal WES \ntest. \nUniversity of California Los Angeles Health System  “This test is intended for use in conjunction with the clinical presentation and other markers of disease progression for the management of patients with rare genetic disorders.”  \nEdgeBio Recommended “In situations where there has been a diagnostic failure with no discernible path . . . In situations where there are currently no available \ntests to determine the status of a potential genetic disease . . . In situations \nwith atypical findings  indicative of multiple disease[s]”  \nChildren’s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics  Provided as a service to families with children who have had an extensive negative work -up for a genetic disease; also used to identify novel disease \ngenes.  \nEmory Genetics Laboratory  “Indicated when there is a suspicion of a genetic etiology contributing to the proband’s manifestations.”  \nKnight Diagnostic Laboratory  “diagnosing rare hereditary diseases, inconclusive results from targeted panel tests, presentation of multiple phenotypes or when a patient presents an unknown or novel phenotype.”  \nWGS  \nAlthough WGS has been used as a research tool, it is less well -developed as a clinical service. \nSeveral laboratories offer WGS as a clinical service. \n\nGT76 | 6 Transcriptome Sequencing  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing is primarily used as a research tool, but several labs now \noffer such testing for clinical purposes.  \nREGULATORY STATUS  \nNo U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -cleared genotyping tests were found. Thus, \ngenotyping is offered as a laboratory -developed test. Clinical laboratories may develop and \nvalidate tests in- house (“home- brew”) and market them as a laboratory service.  Such tests \nmust meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). \nThe laboratory offering the service must be licensed by CLIA for high- complexity testing.  \nEVIDENCE SUMMARY  \nValidation of the clinical use of any genetic test focuses on three main principles:  \n1. The analytic validity of the test, which refers to the technical accuracy of the test in detecting a variant  that is present or in excluding a variant  that is absent;  \n2. The clinical validity of the test, which refers to the diagnostic performance of the test (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) in detecting clinical disease; and  \n3. The clinical utility of the test, i.e., how the results of the diagnostic test will be used to change management of the patient and whether these changes in management lead to clinically important improvements in health outcomes.  \nThe focus of the literature search was on evidence related to the ability of genetic test results to: \n• Guide decisions in the clinical setting related to either treatment, management, or prevention, and  \n• Improve health outcomes as a result of those decisions.  \nWHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING (WES)  \nThe clinical validity  of WES is related to the diagnostic performance of this technology, while \nthe clinical utility lies in the influence of the results on medical decision making and patient outcomes. For  clinical utility to be established, evidence would be needed of the ability of WES \nto provide the following improvements over other testing methods:  \n• Ability to establish a definitive diagnosis by detection of additional variant s not found by \nother testing methods and leading to management changes that improve outcomes and/or eliminate the need for additional testing   \n• Equivalent or superior accuracy attained with superior efficiency of workup (e.g., diagnosis obtained more quickly) compared with other methods of sequencing.  \nTechnology Assessments \nA 2013 BlueCross BlueShield Association Technology Evaluation Center (TEC) Special Report \non WES in patients with suspected genetic disorders, found no published studies that systematically examined potential outcomes of interest such as changes in medical  \nmanagement (including revision of initial diagnoses), and changes in reproductive decision \n\nGT76 | 7 making after a diagnosis of a Mendelian disorder by WES.[6] The evidence was limited to a \nsmall number of studies of patient series and a larger number of very small series or family \nstudies that reported anecdotal examples of medical management and reproductive decision-making outcomes of exome sequencing in patients who were not diagnosed by traditional methods. These studies showed that, over and above traditional molecular and conventional diagnostic testing, exome sequencing could lead to a diagnosis that influenced patient care and/or reproductive decisions but gave no indication of the proportion of patients for which this was true. The report noted that publication of a large number of small diagnostic studies with positive results but few with negative results raise the possibility of publication bias, the impact of which is unknown.  \nIn 2020, the Washington State Health Care Authority released a technology assessment of \nWES.\n[7] Information on the diagnostic yield of WES was calculated using data from 99 studies. \nThe overall pooled estimate for this was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.7% to 40.6%), \nwhile the pooled yield for gene panels and traditional testing pathways were 27% (95% CI 13.7% to 40.5%) and 21% (95% CI 5.6% to 36.4%), respectively.  The diagnostic yield \ngenerally decreased with increasing patient age. The clinical utility of WES was assessed based on data from 30 studies, most of which were single- arm observational cohort studies. \nThe key findings from this assessment were:  \n• “Among studies that enrolled patients with diverse phenotypes (18 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 12% to 100%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 5% to 25%  \no A WES diagnosis resulted in counseling and genetic testing for family members for between 4% and 97%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with epilepsy (5 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 0% to 31%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 0% to 20%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with a single phenotype (7 studies), all reported some changes in clinical management following a WES diagnosis, but the data was too heterogenous to synthesize into a single range.”  \nThe certainty of the evidence related to clinical utility was rated as very low due to study limitations including study design, inconsistency, and imprecision. Evidence related to health outcomes could not be evaluated due to the substantial limitations in study design and outcome reporting among the seven studies that reported these outcomes.  \nWES f\nor Children with Multiple Congenital Anomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of \nUnknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nSince the publication of the 2013 TEC Special Report, several studies have been published that address the use of either WES (see Table 1)  in clinical practice. Typically, the populations \nincluded in these studies have had suspected rare genetic disorders, although the specific populations vary.  Smith (2019 ) reported a scoping review of genome and exome sequencing \nas a diagnostic tool for pediatric patients.\n[8] The authors identified 171 publications, although \n131 were case reports. They concluded that diagnostic yield was the only consistently reported outcome. The median diagnostic yield in publications including more than single case reports was 33% but varied by broad clinical categories and test type.  \nSeries have been reported with as many as 2, 000 patients. The most common reason for \nreferral to a tertiary care center was an unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder. Many \n\nGT76 | 8 patients had been through standard clinical workup and testing without identification of a \ngenetic variant to explain their condition. Diagnostic yield in these studies, defined as the proportion of tested patients with clinically relevant genomic abnormalities, ranged from 25% to 48%. Because there is no reference standard for the diagnosis of patients who have exhausted alternative testing strategies, clinical confirmation may be the only method for determining false- positive and false- negative rates. No reports were identified of incorrect \ndiagnoses, and how often they might occur is unclear. When used as a first -line test in infants \nwith multiple congenital abnormalities and dysmorphic features, diagnostic yield may be as high as 58%. Testing parent -child trios has been reported to increase diagnostic yield, to \nidentify an inherited variant from an unaffected parent and be considered benign, or to identify a de novo variant not present in an unaffected parent. First -line trio testing for children with \ncomplex  neurologic disorders was shown to increase the diagnostic yield (29%, plus a possible \ndiagnostic finding in 27%) compared with a standard clinical pathway (7%) performed in parallel in the same patients .\n[9] \nTable 1.

These series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 22% to 58%, depending on the individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. Comparative studies have reported an increase in diagnostic yield compared with standard testing strategies. Thus, for individuals who have a suspected genetic etiology but for whom the specific genetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. A genetic diagnosis for these patients is reported to change management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. \nWES for Children with a Suspected Genetic Disorder Other Than Multiple Congenital \nAnomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of Unknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nMost of the literature on WES is on neurodevelopmental disorders in children; however, other \npotential indications for WES have been reported (see Table 2 ). These include limb- girdle \nmuscular dystrophy, inherited retinal disease, and other disorders including mitochondrial, endocrine, and immunologic disorders.  \nTable 2.

VUS: variant of uncertain significance  \nSection Summary  \nThere is an increasing number of reports assessing use of WES identify a molecular basis for \ndisorders other than multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies ranged from 3% for colorectal cancer to 60% for trio (parents and child) analysis of limb- girdle muscular dystrophy. Some studies have reported on the use \nof a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease- associated genes, and the authors \nnoted that WES data allows reanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder, and study of WES in these disorders is at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  \nWHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING (WGS)  \nA 2020 Health Technology Assessment conducted by Ontario Health, with literature searches conducted in January 2019, included a comparative review of the diagnostic yield of WES and WGS in children with unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies.\n[47] The diagnostic yield across all studies was 37% (95% CI 34% to 40%). More \nstudies, with an overall larger sample size, were included in the examination on WES (34 \n\nGT76 | 15 studies, n=9,142) than on whole genome sequencing (nine studies, n=648). Confidence \nintervals for studies using WES versus WGS overlapped (37%, 95% CI 34% to 40% vs. 40%, \n95% CI 32% to 49%). Diagnostic yield ranged between 16% and 73%, with variation attributed largely to technology used and participant selection. The overall quality of the evidence was \nrated as very low, downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision.  \nThis body of evidence suggests that the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup. However, it is not possible to determine from these studies the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis following WES.  \nIn some studies of WGS, the genes examined were those previously associated with the phenotype, while other studies were research -based and conducted more exploratory analysis. \nIt has been noted that genomes sequenced with WGS are available for future review when new variants associated with clinical diseases are discovered.\n[48] Studies have shown that \nWGS can detect more pathogenic variants than WES, due to an improvement in detecting copy number variants, insertions and deletions, intronic single nucleotide variants, and exonic single nucleotide variants in regions with poor coverage on WES. Most studies of  WGS \nindicated that only pathogenic or likely -pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic \nyield and that variants of uncertain significance were not reported (see Table 3). Five studies included in the Ontario HTA review provided data on the yield of VUS, with an overall yield of 17%. Only one of the five  studies used WGS, however. The review authors noted, \"Whole \ngenome sequencing always results in substantially longer lists of variants of unknown significance than whole exome sequencing does. Interpreting and acting upon variants of unknown clinical significance is the single greatest challenge identified by clinicians….”\n[47] \nThe use of WGS and rapid WGS has been studied in critically ill children in several observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, two  randomized controlled trial s \n(RCTs), and one systematic review. Studies are described in Table 6. The systematic review \nand RCTs are discussed in more detail in the following systematic review and r andomized \ncontrolled trials sections. One study included only infants with cardiac defects and had a \ndiagnostic yield of 6% with WGS. The remaining studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60%.  \nTable 3.

Three RCTs were included. The mean age of study participants was two days to 18 years. The quality of evidence was rated as \n\nGT76 | 21 high for the included RCTs and moderate for the observational studies.  The meta- analysis \nrevealed a statistically significantly higher  pooled diagnostic yield for WGS, 38.6% (95% CI  \n32.6 to 45.0) , compared to WES, 37.8% (95% CI  32.9 to 42.9) , and usual care, 7.8% (95% CI  \n4.4 to 13.2) . The review authors concluded that although whole genome sequencing for the \npediatric population with suspected genetic disorders provided an accurate and early genetic \ndiagnosis in a high proportion of cases, further research is needed to evaluate costs, effectiveness, and cost -effectiveness of WGS.  \nRandomized Controlled Trials  \nKingsmore (2019) reported early results of a randomized trial comparing rapid WGS (rWGS) to \nrapid WES (rWES) for seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology at a single center  \n(NSIGHT2 trial ).\n[35] Of the 578 eligible infants, 213 were enrolled in the study, 24 of whom were \nvery ill and received ultra- rapid WGS (ultra -rWGS) without randomization. Ninety -four of the \nremaining 189 infants were randomized to receive rWGS and 95 to receive rWES. The diagnostic yield of ultra -rWGS for the 24 very ill infants was 11 (46%)  and the median time to \nresult was 4.6 days. The diagnostic  yields were very similar for both randomized groups  (18/94 \n[19%] for rWGS and 19/95 [20%] for rWES), as were the times to results, which were 11.0 and \n11.2 days for rWGS and rWES, respectively.  Dimmock (2020)  reported results of the primary \nendpoint of NSIGHT2: clinician perception that rWGS was useful and clinic ian-reported \nchanges in management.\n[51] Clinicians provided perceptions of the clinical utility of diagnostic \ngenomic sequencing for 201 of 213 infants randomized (94%). In 154 (77%) infants, diagnostic genomic sequencing was perceived to be useful or very useful; perceptions of usefulness did not differ between infants who received rWES and rWGS, nor between ultra- rWGS and \nrWES/rWGS. Thirty -two (15%) of 207 clinician responses indicated that diagnostic genomic \nsequencing changed infant outcomes (by targeted treatments in 21 infants, avoidance of complications in 16, and institution of palliative care in two  infants). Changes in outcome did \nnot differ significantly between infants randomized to rWES and rWGS, although ultra- rWGS \nwas associated with a significantly  higher rate of change in manag ement than rWES/rWGS \n(63% vs. 23% , p=0.0001).  \nPetrikin (2018) reported on the INSIGHT1 RCT of rWGS  to diagnose suspected genetic \ndisorders in critically ill infants.\n[58] INSIGHT1 was an investigator -initiated (funded by National \nHuman Genome Research Institute [NHGRI] and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD]), blinded, pragmatic trial comparing trio rWGS with standard genetic tests to standard genetic tests alone with a primary outcome of proportion of NICU/PICU infants receiving a genetic diagnosis within 28 days. Parents of patients and clinicians were unblinded after 10 days and compassionate cross -over to rWGS \noccurred in five  control patients. The study was designed to enroll 500 patients in each group \nbut was terminated early due to loss of equipoise on the part of study clinicians who began to regard standard tests alone as inferior to standard tests plus trio rWGS. Intention- to-treat \nanalyses were reported, i.e., crossovers were included in the group to which they were randomized. The trial required confirmatory testing of WGS results which lengthened the time to rWGS diagnosis by 7 to 10 days. Molecular diagnosis was achieved in 31% of the rWGS \ngroup, compared with 3% in the standard testing group (p=0.003). The time to diagnosis was also significantly shorter in the rWGS group (13 days vs. 107 days, p=0.002).  \nIn the NICUSeq RCT, Krantz (2021) compared rWGS (test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease at five  sites in the US.\n[50] In 76% of cases, both \n\nGT76 | 22 parents were available for trio testing. Overall, 82 of 354 infants received a diagnosis (23%), \nwith a higher yield in the 15- day group. The primary outcome was change in management, \nmeasured at day 60. Significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs 10.3% , p=0.009, odds ratio 2.3, 95% \nCI 1.22 to 4.32). Changes in management included subspecialty referral (21 of 354, 6.0%), changes to medication (5 of 354, 1.4%), therapeutics specific to the primary genetic etiology (7 of 354, 2.0%) and surgical interventions (12 of 354, 3.4%). Survival and length of stay did not \ndiffer between the groups.  \nSection Summary \nWGS has been studied in critically ill and non- critically ill children with congenital abnormalities \nand development delays of unknown etiology following standard workup.  The diagnostic yield \nfor WGS has been reported between 20% and 40%. Additional indirect evidence is available from studies reporting diagnostic yield and change in management results of WES in a similar population, and it is reasonable to expect that WGS is likely to result in similar or better diagnostic yield for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and similar changes in management as compared with WES. WGS has also been studied in children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup. The diagnostic yield of WGS has been between 9% and 55%.  However, these studies include mixed indications with heterogenous populations and include little information about associated changes in management following genetic diagnosis . \nWES/WGS FOR OTHER INDICATIONS \nWES/WGS for Preimplantation  \nPeters (2015) reported on the results of WGS performed on three 5- to 10- cell biopsies from \ntwo blastocyst -stage embryos in order to detect single base de novo variants and small \ninsertions and deletions.\n[73] Both parents and paternal grandparents were also analyzed in \norder to measure false- positive and false- negative error rates. Overall, great than 95% of each \ngenome was called. Experimentally derived haplotypes were used to detect up to 82% of de \nnovo SNVs with a false -positive rate of about one error per gigabase, resulting in fewer than \n10 errors per embryo. The authors state that this represents an approximately 100- fold lower \nerror rate than previously published from 10- cell embryos, and it is the first  demonstration that \nWGS can be used to accurately identify de novo variants in spite of the thousands of false-positive errors introduced by the extensive DNA amplification required for deep sequencing.  \nWES/WGS for Pre natal Fetal Testing \nGirolamo (2023) published a systematic review and meta- analysis to estimate the incremental \nyield of detecting pathogenic or likely pathogenic diagnostic genetic variants (DGV) by whole exome sequencing (WES) over standard karyotype and chromosomal microarray (CMA) analyses in fetuses with isolated increased nuchal translucency (NT) and normal fetal anatomy at the time of 11- 14 weeks scan.\n[74] The secondary outcomes were the detection of a genetic \nvariant of unknown significance. Sub- analysis according to different NT cutoffs (between 3.0 \nand 5.5 mm and > 5.5 mm) and considering fetuses with isolated NT in which fetal anatomy was confirmed to be normal at the anomaly scan were also performed.  Eight articles (324 \nfetuses) were included in the systematic review. Of the fetuses with negative standard karyotype and CMA analysis, the 8.07% (95% CI 5.4 to 11.3) had pathogenic or likely \n\nGT76 | 23 pathogenic genetic variants detected exclusively by WES. When stratifying the analysis \naccording to NT cutoffs, genetic anomalies detected exclusively at WES analysis were found in 44.70% (95% CI 26.8 to 63.4) of fetuses with NT between 3.0 mm and 5.5 mm and 55.3% \n(95% CI 36.6 to 73.2) in those fetuses with NT >5.5 mm and positive WES results. The 7.84% \n(95% CI 1.6 to18.2) had variants of unknown significance identified by WES.  Pathogenic and \nlikely pathogenic genetic variants detected by WES are present in a significant proportion of \nfetuses with increased NT but normal standard karyotype and CMA analysis, also when no anomalies are detected at the anomaly scan. Further large studies sharing objective protocols of imaging assessment are needed to confirm these findings . \nMellis (2022) published a systematic review and meta- analysis of WES for prenatal diagnosis \nof fetal structural anomalies, which included data from 66 studies  and 4, 350 fetuses  that had \nnormal karyotype or CMA testing.\n[75] The incremental diagnostic yield of WES in this setting \nwas reported to be 31% (95% CI 26% to 36% ) and was higher in cases that were pre- selected \nas likely having monogenic disorders (42% vs. 15%). By phenotype, the yield was also higher in cases with skeletal abnormalities (53%) and lowest in cases with isolated increased nuchal translucency (2%).  \nWES/WGS for Pregnancy Loss  \nQiao (2016) evaluated the use of WES to identify genetic causes of idiopathic recurrent early pregnancy loss (RPL), assessing seven euploid miscarriages from four families with RPL.\n[76] \nThe study identified compound heterozygous pathogenic variants of DYNC2H1  and ALOX15  in \ntwo out of four families with RPL. Although the authors concluded that CNVs, individual SNVs and pool of deleterious gene variants identified by exome sequencing could contribute to RPL, they acknowledge that the study has limitations, mainly the small  sample cohort is small and \nthat functional analysis of the candidate variants must be evaluated to determine whether the variants are causative.  \nWHOLE TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING  \nTranscriptome sequencing has been used mainly as a research tool to identify potential \nmarkers for understanding disease pathologies or identifying markers for disease detection. \nLimited clinical studies of transcriptome sequencing have been published. For  example, a \nstudy by Walter (2021) compared whole transcriptome sequencing to WGS in 279 patients \nwith acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; B-cell n=211, T- cell n = 68) .[77] Transcriptome \nsequencing was able to distinguish between B -cell ALL and T- cell ALL based on the \nexpression of 14 markers, and it was used to identify  a number of gene fusions.   \nPRACTICE GUIDELINE SUMMARY \nAMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL GENETICS \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical \npractice guideline for the use of WES and WGS in pediatric patients and made the following recommendation: \"We strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second- tier test \n(guided by clinical judgment and often clinician- patient/family shared decision making after \nCMA or focused testing) for patients with one or more [congenital anomalies]  prior to one year \nof age or for patients with [developmental delay/intellec tual disability]  with onset prior to 18 \nyears of age.\"\n[78] The recommendation was informed by a systematic evidence review and a \nhealth technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.  \n\nGT76 | 24 In 2015, ACMG published a policy statement updating their 2013 their recommendation s for \nanalysis and reporting of secondary/ incidental findings in whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing .[79, 80] \n• The panel states that patients must be made aware, it the time of consent, that \nlaboratories routinely analyze the sequence of a set of genes deemed to be highly medically actionable so as to detect pathogenic variants that may predispose to a severe but preventable disease. \n• Although patients have the choice to opt out of receiving these results, that they should be made aware of the ramifications of doing so.  \nDue to the inherent difficulty of counseling patients about the features of each disorder and every gene deemed actionable by the ACMG, analysis and reporting of secondary findings should apply to the entire list of medically actionable genes, and not a subset.  \nSUMMARY  \nThere is enough research to show that whole exome sequencing (WES) can increase diagnosis rates and improve health outcomes for certain children who are suspected of having a genetic disorder. In some situations, WES testing may prevent the need for more invasive diagnostic tests, such as muscle biopsy. Therefore, WES may be considered \nmedically necessary when policy criteria are met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole exome sequencing (WES) improves health outcomes for patients who do not meet the policy criteria, including adults and individuals with signs and symptoms consistent with a well -known disorder that can be \nidentified by targeted testing. Therefore, WES is considered investigational when policy criteria are not met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) can \nbe used to improve patient health outcomes.  In addition, there are technical limitations such \nas the lack of standardized laboratory procedures, gaps in interpreting ancillary information, and the detection of variants of uncertain significance. Therefore, the use of WGS  is \nconsidered investigational for all indications.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole transcriptome sequencing can be used to improve patient health outcomes.  This technology has been primarily used in the \nresearch setting and there is little evidence regarding its clinical use.  Therefore, whole \ntranscriptome sequencing is considered investigational for all indications.  \nREFERENCES  \n 1. den Dunnen JT, Dalgleish R, Maglott DR, et al.

To the extent there may be any conflict between the Medical Policy and contract language, the contract \nlanguage takes precedence.  \nPLEASE NOTE: Contracts exclude from coverage, among other things, services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers may bill members for services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers are e ncouraged to inform members before rendering such \nservices that the members are likely to be financially responsible for the cost of these services.  \n \nDESCRIPTION  \nFragile X syndrome (FXS), caused by expansion of the FMR1  gene, is characterized by \nintellectual disability. FXS is also associated with certain physical and behavioral characteristics, including typical facial features, connective tissue anomalies, autism spectrum disorder , and seizures.  Fragile XE (FRAXE) syndrome is caused by expansion of the AFF2  \ngene (also known as FMR2 ) and is associated with mild intellectual disability without \nconsistent physical features.  \nMEDICAL POLICY CRITERIA  \n \nNote: This policy applies to diagnostic testing only. Reproductive carrier screening is \naddressed separately (see Cross References).  \nI. Diagnostic genetic testing for FMR1  variant s may be considered medically necessary \nwhen one or more of the following criteria are met : \nA. Individuals with intellectual disability , developmental del ay, or autism spectrum \ndisorder . \nB. Individuals  diagnosed with primary ovarian insufficiency  before the age of 40. \n\n\nGT43 | 2 C. Prenatal testing of f etuses of known carrier mothers.  \nD. Individuals with neurologic symptoms consistent with fragile X  syndrome, \nincluding but not limited to ataxia and intention tremor . \nII.

Reproductive Carrier Screening for Genetic Diseases , Genetic Testing, Policy No. 81  \nBACKGROUND  \nHuman Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature[1] is used to describe variants found \nin DNA and serves as an international standard. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017. According to this nomenclature, the term “variant” is used to describe a change in a DNA or protein sequence, replacing previously -used \nterms, such as “mutation.” Pathogenic variants are variants associated with disease, while benign variants are not. The majority of genetic changes have unknown effects on human health, and these are referred to as variants of uncertain significance.  \nFragile X Syndrome  \n\nGT43 | 3 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common cause of heritable intellectual disability , \ncharacterized by mild to moderate intellectual disability . In addition to the intellectual \nimpairment, patients present with typical facial characteristics such as an elongated face with a \nprominent forehead, protruding jaw, and large ears. Connective tissue anomalies include hyperextensible finger and thumb joi nts, hand calluses, velvet -like skin, flat feet , and mitral \nvalve prolapse. The characteristic appearance of adult males includes macroorchidism. Patients may show behavioral problems  including autism spectrum disorders, sleeping \nproblems, social anxiety, poor eye contact, mood disorders and hand- flapping or biting. \nAnother prominent feature of the disorder is neuronal hyperexcitability  manifested by \nhyperactivity, increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli , and a high incidence of epileptic \nseizures. \nCurrent approaches to therapy are supportive and symptom -based. Psychopharmacologic \nintervention to modify behavioral problems in a child with fragile X syndrome may represent an \nimportant adjunctive therapy when combined with other supportive strategies including speech therapy, occupational therapy, special educational services, and behavioral interventions. Medication management may be indicated to modify attention deficits, problems with impulse control, and hyperactivity. Anxiety -related symptoms, incl uding obsessive compulsive \ntendencies with perseverative behaviors, also may be present and require medical intervention. Emotional lability and episodes of aggression and self -injury may be a danger to \nthe child and others around him or her; therefore, the use of medication(s) to modify these symptoms also may significantly improve an affected child’s ability to participate more successfully in activities in home and school settings.  \nDNA studies are used to test for fragile X syndrome (FXS) . Genotypes of individuals with \nsymptoms of FXS and individuals at risk for carrying the pathogenic variant  can be determined \nby examining the size of the CGG trinucleotide repeat segment and the methylation status of \nthe FMR1  gene on the X chromosome. There are no known forms of fragile X mental \nretardation protein (FMRP) deficiency that do not map to the FMR1  gene.  Two main testing \napproaches are used: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analysis. In  fragile \nX testing , the high fraction of GC bases in the repeat region makes it extremely difficult for \nstandard PCR techniques to amplify beyond about 100- 150 CGG. As a result, Southern blot \nanalysis is commonly used to determine the number of triplet repeats in FXS  and methylation \nstatus .  \nCGG -repeat expansion full mutations account for more than 99% of cases of fragile X \nsyndrome (FXS). Therefore, tests that effectively detect and measure the CGG repeat region of the FMR1  gene are more than 99% sensitive. Positive results are 100% specific. The patient \nis classified as normal, intermediate (or “gray zone”), premutation, or full mutation based on \nthe number of CGG repeats.  \n• Full mutation: >200- 230 CGG repeats (methylated)  \n Patients with a full mutation are associated with FXS, which is caused by expansion of the FMR1  gene CGG triplet repeat above 200 units in the untranslated region of FMR1 , leading \nto a hypermethylation of the promoter region followed by transcriptional inactivation of the gene. The FXS is caused by a loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Approximately 1% to 3% of children ascertained on the basis of autism diagnosis are shown to have fragi le X syndrome.  \n \n\nGT43 | 4 Full mutations are typically maternally transmitted.  The mother of a child with an FMR1  \nmutation is almost always a carrier of a premutation or full mutation. Men who are \npremutation carriers are referred to as transmitting males. All of their daughters will inherit a \npremutation, but their sons will not inherit the premutation. Males with a full mutation usually have intellectual disability  and decreased fertility.  \n• Premutation: 55- 200 CGG repeats (unmethylated)  \n Patients with a premutation are carriers and are at small risk for developing a FMR1 -related \ndisorder, fragile X -associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). This disorder  is a late \nonset, progressive development of intention tremor and ataxia often accompanied by progressive cognitive and behavioral difficulties including memory loss, anxiety, reclusive behavior, deficits of executive function and dementia, or premature ovarian insufficiency \n(FXPOI).  \n Premutation alleles in females are unstable and may expand to full mutations in offspring. Premutations of less than 59 repeats have not been reported to expand to a full mutation in a single generation. Premutation alleles in males may expand or contract by several repeats with transmission; however, expansion to full mutations has not been reported.  A \nconsiderable number of children being evaluated for autism have been found to have FMR1  premutations (55- 200 CGG repeats).\n[2] \n• Intermediate: 45- 54 CGG repeats (unmethylated)  \n• Normal: 5 -44 CGG repeats (unmethylated)  \nFragile XE Syndrome  \nFragile XE syndrome (FRAXE)  is much rare r than FXS, and affects an estimated 1 on 25,000 \nto 100,000 males .[3] This disorder is characterized by mild intellectual disability, though some \naffected individuals may have borderline cognitive function that is not severe enough to be classified as a disability.  \nSimilar to FXS, FRAXE is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion – nearly all cases are \ndue to the presence of more than 200 repeats of CCG in the AFF2  gene (sometimes referred \nto as FMR2 ). Individuals with 50 to 200 CCG repeats are said to have a premutation, which is \nnot associated with impaired cognition.   \nRegulatory Status  \nNo FDA -cleared genotyping tests were found. Thus, genotyping is offered as a laboratory -\ndeveloped test. Clinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in- house and market them \nas a laboratory service . Such tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). The laboratory offering the service must be licensed by CLIA for high- complexity testing.  \nAsuragen offers the Xpansion Interpreter ™ test which analyzes AGG sequences that interrupt \nthe CGG repeats which have been suggested to stabilize alleles and protect against expansion in subsequent generations.  \nNote : An additional test for developmental delays, Lineagen FirstStepDxPLUS, offers \nsequencing of FMR1  in combination with a chromosomal microarray genetic test. When FMR1  \n\nGT43 | 5 analysis is bundled with CMA analysis or any other genetic test, additional plan medical \npolicies may apply. For the plan’s medical policy on CMA analysis, see Cross References in the section above.  \nEVIDENCE  SUMMARY  \nThe focus of this review is on evidence related to the clinical utility of the testing, which is the \nability of test results to:  \n• Guide decisions in the clinical setting related to either treatment, management, or \nprevention, and  \n• Improve health outcomes as a result of those decisions.  \nFMR1  \nThe conditions caused by abnormal CGG repeats in the FMR1  gene, FXS, FXTAS, and \nFXPOI, do not have specific treatments that alter the natural history of the disorders. However, \nbecause they represent relatively common causes of conditions that are often difficult to diagnose and involve numerous diagnostic tests, the capability of FMR1  testing to obtain an \naccurate definitive diagnosis and avoid additional diagnostic testing supports its clinical utility. Knowledge that the condition is caused by fragile X provides important knowledge to offspring and the risk of disease in subsequent generations.  \nSince there is no specific treatment for FXS , a definitive diagnosis will not lead to treatment \nthat alters the natural history of the disorder. However, there are several potential ways in which adjunctive management might be changed following genetic testing after confirmation of the diagnosis.\n[4, 5] Although not related specifically to FMR1  testing, the American Academy of \nPediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN)/Child Neurology Society (CNS)  guidelines, described in more detail below, noted  the following more immediate and \ngeneral clinical benefits of achieving a specific genetic diagnosis:  \n• limit additional diagnostic testing;  \n• anticipate and manage associated medical and behavioral comorbidities;  \n• improve understanding of treatment and prognosis;  \n• allow counseling regarding risk of recurrence in future offspring and help with reproductive planning; \n• early diagnosis and intervention in an attempt to ameliorate or improve behavioral and cognitive outcomes over time.  \nIn a 2012 review by Abrams , the importance of early diagnostic and management issues, in \nconjunction with the identification of family members at risk for or affected by FMR1 variant s is \ndiscussed.\n[6] The expanded CGG repeat  in the FMR1  gene, once thought to have clinical \nsignificance limited to fragile X syndrome, is now well established as the cause for other fragile X-associated disorders including fragile X -associated primary ovarian insufficiency and fragile \nX-associated tremor ataxia syndrome in individuals with the premutation (carriers).  \nAlso, FXS is associated with a number of medical  and behavioral comorbidities.\n[7] Behavioral \ncomorbidities may include attention problems, hyperactivity, anxiety, aggression, poor sleep, and self -injury. Individuals with FXS are also prone to seizures, recurrent otitis media, \nstrabismus, gastrointestinal disturbances, and connective tissue problems. A correct diagnosis can lead to the appropriate identification and treatment of these comorbidities.  \n\nGT43 | 6 Hersh (2011) reported on families with an affected male and whether an early diagnosis would \nhave influenced their reproductive decision making.[4] After a diagnosis in the affected male \nwas made, 73% of families reported that the diagnosis of FXS affected their decision to have \nanother child, and 43% of the families surveyed had had a second child with a full mutation.  \nThe feasibility of newborn screening is bei ng investigated.[8] However, there is currently no \ntreatment for FXS that would reduce mortality or morbidity if given in infancy. Also, there are a number of ethical concerns with newborn screening for FXS, including the need for informed consent from both parents, the need for genetic counseling for both full mutation and \npremutation status, and the detection of carriers in infants.\n[9] \nAFF2  \nAs with FXS, there are no specific treatments available for people diagnosed with FRAXE. In addition, FRAXE is a far less common disorder with a variable presentation ranging from relatively normal cognition to mild intellectual disability. There is limited evidence regarding the clinical utility of testing for AFF2 . Several studies have screened for FRAXE in populations with \nintellectual disability\n[10-13], but only one identified a patient with this disorder.[14] \nPRACTICE GUIDELINE SUMMARY \nTHE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL GENETICS   \nThe purpose of the  following American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guideline[15] \nrecommendations is to provide aid to clinicians in making referrals for testing the repeat region \nof the FMR1  gene : \n• Individuals of either sex with intellectual disability , developmental delay, or autism, \nespecially if they have (a) any physical or behavioral characteristics of fragile X syndrome, (b) a family history of fragile X syndrome, or (c) male or female relatives with undiagnosed intellectual disability  \n• Individuals seeking reproductive counseling who have (a) a family history of fragile X syndrome or (b) a family history of undiagnosed intellectual disability  \n• F etuses of known carrier mothers  \n• Affected individuals or their relatives in the context of a positive cytogenetic fragile X test result  who are seeking further counseling related to the risk of carrier status among \nthemselves or their relatives. The cytogenetic test was used prior to the identification of the FMR1  gene and is significantly less accurate than the current DNA test. DNA testing \non such individuals is warranted to accurately identify premutation carriers and to distinguish premutation from full mutation carrier women.   \nIn the clinical genetics evaluation in identifying the etiology of autism spectrum disorders, the ACMG recommends testing for FXS as part of first tier testing.\n[16] \nIn 2021, the ACMG released a revised technical standard on laboratory testing for fragile X.[17] \nThe authors noted that the new laboratory standards \"are in general agreement\" with the 2005 ACMG policy statement summarized above.  \nTHE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS  \n\nGT43 | 7 In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published consensus guidelines which \nsuggested that, because children with FXS may not have apparent physical features, any child who presents with developmental delay, borderline intellectual abilities or intellectual disability,  \nor has a diagnosis of autism without a specific etiology should undergo molecular testing for FXS to determine the number of CGG repeats .\n[4] \nIn 2014, the AAP updated their consensus guidelines which recommend Fragile X testing in patients with global developmental delay (GDD) or intellectual disability (ID).\n[18] Specifically, the \nAAP guideline recommended, “fragile X testing should be performed in all boys and girls with GDD/ID of unknown cause. Of boys with GDD/ID of uncertain cause, 2% to 3% will have fragile X syndrome (full mutation of FMR1 , >200 CGG repeats), as will 1% to 2% of girls (full \nmutation).”  \nTHE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS  \nThe 2017  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) committee opinion \nrecommended prenatal testing for fragile X syndrome for known carriers of the fragile X \npremutation or full mutation and for women with a family history of fragile X -related disorders  \nor intellectual disability s uggestive of fragile X syndrome.\n[19] They additionally recommended \nFMR1  premutation testing for women younger than 40 with unexplained ovarian insufficiency \nor failure, or an elevated follicle- stimulating hormone level.  \nSUMMARY  \nThere is enough research to show that testing the FMR1  gene can improve the diagnostic \nprocess for individuals with fragile X -related symptoms  and help in informed reproductive \ndecision making. Also, clinical guidelines based on research from several  U.S. professional \nassociations recommend this testing for certain people. Therefore, genetic testing for FMR1  \nmay be considered medically necessary for patients when criteria are met . \nFor all other situations , FRM1  gene testing provides no benefit in directing medical \nmanagement and is therefore considered not medically necessary.  \nThere is not enough research to show that testing for AFF2  (FMR2 ) variants can help \nimprove health outcomes for patients or inform reproductive decision making. In addition, there are no clinical guidelines based on research that recommend AFF2  testing. Therefore, \ngenetic testing for AFF2  is considered investigational.  \nREFERENCES \n 1. den Dunnen JT, Dalgleish R, Maglott DR, et al.

This phenomenon is often called a \nFounder effect [ National Cancer Institute ( NCI) Dictionary of Genetics  Terms , 2024 ; NCCN, Genetic/Familial High -Risk \nAssessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic v1. 2025]. \n \nGleason Scoring : Gleason Scoring is a system of grading prostate cancer tissue based on how it looks under a \nmicroscope. Gleason Scores range from 2 to 10 and indicate how likely it is that a tumor will spread. A low Gleason Score means the cancer tissue is similar to no rmal prostate tissue and the tumor is less likely to spread. A high Gleason Score \nmeans the cancer tissue is very different from normal and the tumor is more likely to spread (NCI Dictionary of Cancer  \nTerms , 202 4). \n High Penetrance Breast Cancer Susceptibility Genes: Genes in which certain mutations are related to significantly \nincreased likelihood of B reast Cancer.  NCCN i nclude s genes such as  BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, PALB2, PTEN, SKT11 , \nand TP53  (NCCN, Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic v1.2025). \n \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 4 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

It has been estimated that 5- 10% of all cancers are hereditary (Heald et al., 2016). Hereditary cancers typically \nhave an earl ier age of onset and have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance observable in a family (NCCN, \nGenetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic v1.2025 ).  \n \nTo identify whether  an individual has an increased risk of having a hereditary cancer, it is important to take a detailed \nfamily history that includes first -, second - and third -degree relatives and focuses on cancer diagnoses by age of onset, \nprimary site(s), presence of bil ateral disease, and current age or age at time of death. Other conditions that can be a \nfeature of hereditary cancers should be noted, as well as medical and surgical history. The individual should have a \nthorough physical exam performed  by a clinician with familiarity with hereditary cancer syndromes. When applicable, risk \nassessment tools should be utilized to help identify the risk of an individual having a hereditary cancer gene. Some \nexamples of tools include BRCAPRO, the Breast and Ovarian Cancer Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) , and PREMM plus (NCCN, Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, \nand Pancreatic v 1.2025 ). Genetic testing is generally recommended when there is a personal or family history consistent \nwith a hereditary cancer susceptibility, the test can be adequately interpreted , and the results can be used to diagnose or \ninfluence the medical management of the individual or at -risk family members (Robson et al., 2015).  \n Breast Cancer is the second most common cause of cancer -related death among women (Siegel et al., 2022), affecting \napproximately 13% of women in the general population at some time in their lives (NCI, 2024). BRCA1  and BRCA2 \ngenes, sometimes called tumor suppressor genes, can contain certain pathogenic changes that may lead to cancer development. Individuals who inherit harmful variants in one or both of these genes are at an increased risk of Breast Cancer as well as several other types of cancer. Women wh o are found to have a harmful BRCA  variant are significantly \nmore likely to develop Breast or Ovarian Cancer in their lifetime; for Breast Cancer, estimated risk is 60% -72% for women \nwho are carriers of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) BRCA1  variant and 55% -69% for BRCA2  P/LP variant carriers. \nFor Ovarian Cancer, cumulative risk (by age 70) associated with BRCA1  P/LP variants is approximately 48.3% and for \nBRCA2 , associated cumulative risk is approximately 20%. Breast and Ovarian Cancer are most notabl e, but elevated risk \nof other cancers, including fallopian tube cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer, is also present. Other genes, such as CDH1, PALB2, PTEN, STK11 , ATM , BRIP1  and TP53  have been linked to a higher \nrisk of Breast, Ovarian, and/or pancreatic Cancer as well. (NCI, 2024; NCCN, Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: \nBreast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic v1.2025).  \n NCCN suggests that several specific genes may contribute to hereditary cancers including, but not limited to, those in the table below. (NCCN, Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic v 1.202 5, NCCN, \nGenetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Colorectal v2.2024 , NCCN, Prostate Cancer v4.2024). \n \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 7 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

These Panels are intuitively attractive because they can rapidly test for numerous mutations related to increased cancer risk both within a single gene and across multiple genes. It is also possible that these Multi -\nGene tests can, in the case of families where more than one hereditary cancer syndrome is suspected, be performed more cost effectively than stepwise individual gene testing. However, many Panel tests also  include low to moderate-risk \ngenes that may result in the identification of gene mutations that are of unclear clinical significance  and/or cannot  be used \nto direct an individual’s medical management. Identification of mutations for which the clinical management is uncertain \nmay lead to unnecessary follow -up testing and procedures, all of which have their own inherent risks [NCCN, \nGenetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic v1.2025; NCCN, Genetic/Familial High -Risk \nAssessment: Co lorectal v2.2024 ; LaDuca et al., 2014; Robson et al., 2015; Kurian et al., 2014 ( included in Hayes, 2023) ; \nTung et al., 2015; Plon et al., 2011 ]. \n \nClinical Evidence  \n \nBRCA1/BRCA2  \nTesting for BRCA1  and BRCA 2 mutations  can include targeted analysis for pathogenic founder variants for at risk \npopulations  (e.g., individuals  with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry ), sequence analysis  and duplication/deletion analysis  of \nBRCA1  and BRCA2 , or a multigene panel . BRCA1  accounts for about 66% of  BRCA1/BRCA2 -associated hereditary \nbreast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). S equence analysis can identify variants in approximately  87-89% of cases \nfor BRCA1  and 97 -98% of cases for BRCA2 . Gene -targeted duplication/deletion testing identifies variants in eleven to \nthirteen percent  of cases  for BRCA1  and two to three percent  for BRCA2  (Petrucelli et al., 2023 ). The risk of developing \nbreast and ovarian cancer are significantly increased in individuals who inherit a harmful variation in BRCA1  or BRCA2 ; \nover 60% of women with these variants  with develop breast cancer in their lifetime, compared with only 13% of women in \nthe general population.  Women with BRCA1  and BRCA2  variations are also at increased risk of developing cancer in the \ncontralateral breast in the future. Approximately 39% -58% of women with a harmful mutation in BRCA1  and 13% -29% of \nwomen with a harmful mutation in BRCA2  will develop ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube cancer and primary \nperitoneal cancer) in their lifetime, compared to only 1.1% of women in the general population. There is also evidence that variations in BRCA1  or BRCA2  genes are related to increased risk of pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and other \ncancers such as melanoma, gastric cancer, and uterine serious carcinoma (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2024).  \n Several studies have shown that BRCA1  breast cancer is more likely to be characterized as triple negative . Studies \nhave reported BRCA1  pathogenic/likely pathogenic ( P/LP ) variants in 4.4% to 16% of individuals with triple -negative \nbreast cancer. In addition, it appears that among patients with triple- negative disease, BRCA  mutation carriers were \ndiagnosed at a younger age compared with non- carriers (NCCN, Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, \nOvarian, and Pancreatic v1.2025). A study of 54 women aged 40 years or younger with triple -negative breast cancer \nwho were not considered candidates for BRCA  testing because of the lack of a strong family history revealed that five of \nthe women had BRCA1  mutations and one of the women had a BRCA2  mutation (11% mutation prevalence) (Young et \nal., 2009). In a cohort of individuals with triple -negative breast cancer (median age of 51 years ), Gonzalez -Angulo et al. \n(2011) found a 19.5% incidence of BRCA  mutations. The authors recommend that genetic testing be discussed with all \npatients  diagnosed  with triple -negative breast cancer.  \n To investigate the significance of BRCA1/2  mutations in familial pancreatic cancer (FPC), Limijadi et al. (2024) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of nine diagnostic studies including 4267 individuals from the US, \nItaly,  and Poland. The length of the research period for the studies varied from a minimum of two years to a maximum of \n36 years, with average duration of 14 years. Based on their analysis, the reviewers assert  that BRCA1/2  testing  benefit s \nfirst-degree relatives of individuals with FPC, who have two to ten times higher risk than the general population of \ndeveloping FPC. Identifying BRCA1/2  mutations is important not only for FPC risk, but also broader cancer risks such \nas HBOC. BRCA1/2  testing has also shown to be beneficial for  individuals with FPC for whom pol y-ADP ribose \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 8 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Prevalence data was analyzed \nfor individuals from different risk and ethnic groups. Subjects were designated as high- risk (n  = 25,535) if their clinical \nhistory predicted a high prior probability. For these individuals , LR testing was performed automatically in conjunction with \nsequencing. Individuals not meeting  the high- risk criteria  (elective, n  = 22,921)  underwent LR testing if BRCA1/2  \nseque ncing indicated no known mutations. Overall , BRCA1/2  mutation prevalence among subjects considered high-risk \nwas 23.8% vs 8.2% for the elective group. The mutation profile for individuals at high- risk was 90.1% sequencing \nmutations vs 9.9% LRs, and for elective patients was 94.1% sequencing vs 5.9% LRs. The authors noted that this \ndifference may reflect the bias in subjects at high- risk to carry mutations in BRCA1 , which has a higher penetrance and \nfrequency of LRs compared with BRCA2 . Significant differenc es in the prevalence and types of LRs were found in \nindividuals of different ancestries , with LR mutations significantly more common in individuals of Latin \nAmerican/Caribbean descent (Judkins et al., 2012).  \n \nOf 211 Ashkenazi  Jewish  breast cancer probands  with a family  history  of pancreatic  cancer,  Stadler  et al. (2012)  found  that \n30 (14.2%)  harbored a BRCA  mutation.  Fourteen (47%)  of the mutations  were  in BRCA1  and sixteen  (53%)  were  in \nBRCA2 . Subjects diagnosed with breast cancer at 50 years of age or younger were found to have a higher BRCA1/2  \nmutation prevalence than those with breast cancer who were diagnosed at greater than 50 years  of age (21.1% vs 6.9%). \nIn subjects with a first -, second -, or third -degree relative with pancreatic cancer, mutation prevalence was 15.4%, 15.3% \nand 8.6%, respectively. The authors found that BRCA1  and BRCA2  mutations are observed with nearly equal distribution \nin Ashkenazi Jewish families with breast  and/or pancreas can cers, suggesting that both genes are associated with \npancreatic cancer  risk. \n Ferrone et al. (2009) looked at the prevalence of BRCA1  and BRCA2  in an unselected group of individuals of Jewish \ndescent  and compared subjects  with resected BRCA  mutation -associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) to those \nwith PAC but no identified  mutations. Of the 187 individuals of Jewish ancestry who underwent resection for PAC, \ntissue was available for 145. Founder mutations for BRCA1  and BRCA2  were identified in 5.5% of subjects (two with \nBRCA1  [1.3%] and six with BRCA2  [4.1%]). A previous cancer was reported by 24% (35 /145) of subjects , with the \nmost common sites being breast (9/ 35; 74%) and prostate (8 /35; 23%).  These findings led the researchers to conclude \nthat BRCA2 mutations are associated with a higher risk of PAC.  \n \nHereditary Breast , Ovarian , and Pancreatic Cancer Multi -Gene Panels  \nIn a recent cohort study, Whitworth et al. (2022) sought to answer this question:  Could all individuals with breast cancer \nbenefit from multigene germline genetic testing? Currently NCCN guidelines recommend germline testing for high- risk \ngenes in individuals diagnosed with breast cancer when certain criteria are met. This study evaluat es the potential effect \nof universal testing of individuals with breast cancer on clinical decision- making.  The study included 952 individuals \nbetween the ages of 18 and 90 y ears with a diagnosis of breast cancer who had not pre viously undergone either single or \nmultigene testing. Individuals were evaluated as in- criteria or out -of-criteria as per the 2017 NCCN guidelines; t esting was \nthen performed using a multigene germline test panel  (80 genes). Clinicians from a combination of 20 community and \nacademic locations assessed and recorded clinical information and changes to clinical recommendations based on test results.  Relationships between previously unreported clinical features (including BRCAPRO scores) and P/LP prevalence \nwere ascertained. Clinician -reported recommendations for 939 (467 in -criteria and 472 out -of-criteria) of the individuals \nwith breast cancer were made available. For individuals found to have a P/LP variant, changes in recommended management were reported for 83.8% (31/37) of in- criteria individuals and 67.6% (23/34) of out -of-criteria individuals. \nTesting results led to a change in recommendations for 63.6%  (14/22) of out-of-criteria individuals with a variant in a \nbreast cancer predisposition gene. Multigene testing was considered helpful for two- thirds of indi viduals with P/LP \nvariants, and for one- third of the individuals with results that were either negative or found variants of uncertain \nsignificance ( VUS). No changes were made for 98.9% of participants with negative results or VUS. The researchers \nconcluded that universal germline testing provides useful information for clinical decision- making and leads to targeted \ntreatments and/or clinical trials for al l individuals diagnosed with breast cancer.  However, s everal limitations were noted, \nincluding the lack  of documentation of cancer stage at diagnosis; study sites were primarily breast  surgery practices  so \nindividuals included in the study were biased toward early -stage, resectable disease. In addition, the study was performed \nprior to the NCCN guideline update allowing screening of individuals for PARP inhibitor treatment eligibility. The out -of-\n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 9 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n criteria population is skewed to individuals older than 45 ( per NCCN guideline requirements) and there was no ongoing \nfollow up for determination of longer -term outcomes . Lastly, the study was sponsored by a multigene test manufacturer \nand several  of the authors had affiliations with the sponsor, creating potential for bias.  \nHayes (2021, updated 202 4) reported on the evidence for use of genetic testing to detect both high and moderate \nhereditary cancer risk gene variants in woman with new diagnoses of breast cancer regardless of other risk factors. An \noverall low to moderate quality of evidenc e (including f ive studies ) found  that use of gene testing for high- risk breast \ncancer genes identified a small number of women who would not have been recognized with standard clinical criteria for \nselection of candidates for testing. Hayes suggests that there is probable clinical utility for high risk gene screening in \nwomen with breast cancer  who are not preselected for other risk factors . In the case of testing for moderate gene variants, \nevidence for clinical utility is uncertain.  \n \nAlvarado et al. (2020) evaluated 3162 women for the prevalence of P/LP with the same multigene cancer panel including  \n20 genes. The majority of women (65.4%) were post -breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis. Overall prevalence of any P/LP \nresult was 11.7% with nearly 5.4% having BRCA1/2  mutations, while 6.3% had at least one mutation in non- BRCA  genes. \nBreaking the subset down to only those with P/LP result, 55% of the total mutations were non- BRCA . The researchers \nconcluded that multigene cancer panel testing may be appropriate in a high- risk cohort.  \n Corredor et al. (2020) evaluated women with multiple primary breast cancers using panel testing to determine the rate of \nnon-BRCA  mutations. Eight y-five women were tested with a multigene panel and of those, 33 (38.8%) tested positive for a \npathogenic  mutation including  nine women with BRCA1  mutations , five with BRCA2  mutations , five with ATM  mutations , \none with a BARD1  mutation, four with CHEK2  mutations, one with an MSH2  mutation , one with an MSH6  mutation , two \nwith PALB2  mutations , one with a PMS2  mutati on, one with  a PTEN  mutation  and three with TP53  mutations . Overall, \n17.6% tested positive for a non- BRCA  breast cancer predisposition gene.  \n Lee et al. (201 9) reviewed several genes on HBOC susceptibility test panels that have not been fully evaluated for \nstrength of association with disease. The researchers used the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) clinical validity \nframework to calculate the strength of ev idence between selected genes and breast or ovarian cancer. A total of  31 genes \nwere selected for evaluation of the relationship between the gene and breast cancer and 32 genes were selected for \novarian cancer. The relationship was then classified as: Definitive, Strong, Moderate, Limited, Refuted, Disputed,  or No \nReported Evidence. Of the genes, Definitive clinical validity classifications were made for 10 of 31 and 10 of 32 gene-disease pairs for breast and ovarian cancer, respectively. Only 2 genes had a Moderate classification. In the Limited \ngroup, 6 of 31 for breast cancer and 6 of 32 for ovarian cancer were defined. Inconsistent evidence resulted in Disputed or \nRefuted assertions for 9/31 genes for breast and 4/32 genes for ovarian can cer. No Reported Evidence of disease \nassociation was found for 5/31 genes for breast and 11/32 for ovarian cancer. The study demonstrated that there is still \nsome development to be done prior to having standardized panels.  \n \nShimelis et al. (2018) aimed to define the cancer genes associated with an increased risk of triple- negative breast cancer \n(TNBC). A large cohort of subjects  with TNBC was assembled and multi -gene panel testing of 21 genes in 8753 \nparticipants was performed by a clinical testing laboratory  (Ambry Genetics, Alisa Viejo, CA).  Additionally, t esting of 17 \ngenes in 2148 participants from a previous  Triple -Negative Breast Cancer Consortium (TNBCC) study were included . The \nstudy found that germline pathogenic vari ants in BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 , and RAD51D  were associated with \nhigh risk (odds ratio >  5.0) of TNBC and greater than 20% lifetime risk for overall breast cancer among Caucasians. \nPathogenic variants in BRIP1, RAD51C , and TP53  were associated with moderate risk (odds ratio > 2) of TNBC. \nComparable trends were observed for the African American population. Pathogenic variants in these TNBC genes were \ndetected in 12.0% (3.7% non- BRCA1/2 ) of all participants. The researchers concluded that multi -gene heredi tary cancer \npanel testing can identify genes that give an elevated risk of TNBC.  \n \nCrawford et al. (2017) evaluated 300 women who had previously tested negative for pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2  by \neither limited or comprehensive sequencing . All of the study subjects met additional criteria including: 1) a personal history \nof bilateral breast cancer , 2) a personal history of breast cancer and a first - or second-  degree relative with ovarian \ncancer , or 3) a personal history of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma. The testing determined that nine \npercent  of the total population of the study had pathogenic mutations associated with heritable cancer risk and eight \npercent  had mutations in genes other than BRCA1/BRCA2 . Elevated pathogenic mutation rates in genes other than \nBRCA1/2  were found in women of Ashkenazi Jewish and Hispanic descent  (12% an d 18%, respectively) . The researchers \nconcluded that individuals who have tested negative for BRCA1/2  mutations but meet the additional criteria ( outlined \nabove)  should be candidates for subsequent multi- gene panel testing which has important implications for family testing.  \n \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 10 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Clinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \nIn a 2020 statement, ACMG explored the evidence supporting BRCA 1/2 and other inherited breast cancer genetic testing \nfor all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer (Pal et al ., 2020). Although they  recommend that all patients with breast \ncancer be evaluated regarding the need for germline genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer, the ACMG statement \nindicates that the current evidence does not support the use of genetic testing for every individual diagnosed with breast \ncancer, especially in the case of  multi -gene panels that include genes lacking evidence to support a change in medical \nmanagement. When performed, genetic testing for inherited breast cancer should include full gene sequencing, \ndeletion/duplication analysis , and detection of known P/LP variants in an appropriately accredited genetic testing \nlaboratory. When a P/LP variant is found in moderately penetrant breast cancer genes, guidance will be based on \nconsensus recommendations. Enhanced screening has not yet been associated with enhanced survival or earlier \nidentification of disease. The implications of genetic testing should be carefully discuss ed with individuals during genetic \ncounseling with a trained genetics professional or a health care provider with expertise in cancer genetics , and any \nindividual found to have a P/LP variant in established breast cancer genes should be educated about the importance of \ncascade testing of family members.  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn 2019  (reaffirmed 2020) , ACOG published Committee Opinion 793 titled  Hereditary Cancer Syndromes and Risk \nAssessment. The document included recommendations for genetic testing including:  \n A hereditary cancer risk assessment is the key to identifying patients and families who may be at increased risk of \ndeveloping certain types of cancer. Assessments should be performed by obstetrician –gynecologists or other \nobstetric –gynecologic care providers and should be updated regularly.  \n If a hereditary cancer risk assessment suggests an increased risk of a hereditary cancer syndrome, referral to a specialist in cancer genetics or a health care provider with expertise in genetics is recommended for expanded gathering of family history information, risk assessment, education, and counseling, which may lead to genetic testing and tailored cancer screening or risk reduction measures, or both.  \n Genetic testing may be performed using a panel of multiple genes through next -generation sequencing  (NGS)  \ntechnology. This multigene testing process allows for testing for P/LP  variants in multiple genes that may be \nassociated with a specific cancer syndrome or family cancer phenotype (or multiple phenotypes).  It also increases the \nlikelihood of finding VUS.  \n In practice bulletin 182 (2017, reaffirmed 2019), ACOG provided guidance for genetic evaluation of HBOC syndrome. \nTheir recommendations address women with the following:  \n A close relative (mother, sister, daughter, grandmother, granddaughter, aunt,  or niece) with a known BRCA  mutation, \na first -degree or several close relatives that meet one or more of the criteria below , or a close relative with male breast \ncancer . \n A personal history of the following:  \no Ovarian cancer . \no Breast cancer at age 45 years or less . \no Breast cancer and a close relative with breast cancer at age 50 years or less or close relative with ovarian cancer at any age . \no Breast cancer at age 50 years or less with a limited or unknown family history . \no Breast cancer and two or more close relatives with breast cancer at any age, pancreatic cancer , or prostate \ncancer . \no Two breast cancer primaries with the first diagnosed before age 50. \no Triple -negative breast cancer at age 60 years or less . \no Breast cancer and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry . \no Pancreatic cancer and two or more close relatives with a BRCA -related cancer . \n Additionally, in 2017 Committee Opinion  716 (reaffirmed 2021) , ACOG recommends that women with a strong family \nhistory of ovarian, breast , or colon cancer may have a BRCA  mutation or Lynch syndrome (LS) and should be referred for \nformal genetic counseling to assess their cancer risk, and if appropriate, be offered testing.  \n \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS)  \nAn ASBrS consensus guideline (2019) made several recommendations regarding the genetic assessment of hereditary risk for breast cancer including:  \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 11 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n \n Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals knowledgeable in genetics  can provide patient \neducation and counseling, although when the individual’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a certified \ngenetic counselor or genetics professional may be helpful.  \n Multi -gene panels are increasingly available for screening purposes. There is a lack of consensus among experts \nregarding which genes should be tested in different clinical scenarios.  \n Genetic testing should be made available to all individuals with a personal history of breast cancer.  \n Individuals who have had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing.  \n Genetic testing should be made available to individuals without a history of breast cancer when NCCN guidelines  are \nmet. Unaffected individuals should be informed that testing an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more \ninformative than undergoing testing themselves.  \n VUS are not clinically actionable and are considered inconclusive. Individuals should be managed on their risk factors, \nand not a VUS result.  \n \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)  \nASCO published a guideline for genetic testing in women with a diagnosis of epithelial ovarian cancer (Konstantinopoulos , \n2020). This was the result of a systematic review of 19 identified studies including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), \ncomparative observational studies , systematic reviews,  and meta- analyses published from 2007 through 2019. Per the \nASCO guideline, all women with epithelial ovarian cancer should undergo germline genetic testing for BRCA1/2  and other \novarian cancer susceptible genes  (e.g., multigene panel that includes, at minimum, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, RAD51D, \nBRIP1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and PALB2 ). In women without BRCA1/2  variants, somatic tumor testing for \nBRCA1/2  variants should be performed. Health care providers familiar with diagnosis and management of hereditary \ncancer should conduct the genetic evaluations, and first - or second- degree blood relatives of an individual with ovarian \ncancer and a known gene variant should be offered counseling, evaluation,  and testing as well. VUS should not drive \nclinical decision making.  \n ASCO convened an expert panel to determine recommendations for male breast cancer management and recently \npublished the results (Hassett et al., 2020). The panel used 26 studies as the basis of the recommendations. While the \nmajority of recommendations concerned treatment options, the panel did recommend that “genetic counseling and \ngermline genetic testing of cancer predisposition genes should be offered to all men with breast cancer” (Evidence quality: \nlow; Strength of recommendation: strong).  \n An ASCO policy statement update in 2015 (Robson et al.) recommended that genetic testing for cancer susceptibility be \nperformed when the following three criteria are met: the individual being tested has a personal or family history suggestive \nof genetic cancer susceptibility , the test can be adequately interpreted,  and the test results have accepted clinical utility . \n \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO)  \nIn 2024, ASCO and SSO (Bedrosian et al.) published recommendations for germline mutation testing for individuals \ndiagnosed with breast cancer. These recommendations were developed through a systematic review and formal consensus process undertaken by a des ignated multidisciplinary panel of joint ASCO and SSO experts. A total of 47 \narticles met eligibility requirements for inclusion in the analysis for germline mutation recommendations and 18 articles were evaluated for genetic counseling recommendations. As  a results of the review and discussion, the following \nrecommendations for germline genetic testing were made:  \n Individuals 65 years of age or younger and newly diagnosed with breast cancer (stage I -III or de novo stage \nIV/metastatic disease) should be offered BRCA1/2  testing (Formal Consensus; Agreement: 87.50%).  \n Individuals older than 65 years of age diagnosed with breast cancer (stage I -III or de novo stage IV/metastatic \ndisease) should be offered BRCA1/2  testing if they:  \no Are candidates for poly  (ADP –ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy for early -stage or metastatic disease.  \no Have triple- negative breast cancer . \no Have personal or family history suggesting the possibility of a pathogenic variant . \no Were assigned male sex at birth . \no Are of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry or are members of a population with an increased prevalence of founder  \nmutations (Formal Consensus; Agreement: 92.50%) . \n Individuals undergoing BRCA1/2  testing should be offered testing for other hereditary cancer predisposition genes to \nbe determined by their individual or family history (Formal Consensus; Agreement: 90%) . \n Any individual with recurrent breast cancer (local or metastatic) who is a candidate for PARP inhibitor therapy should \nbe offered BRCA1/2  testing regardless of their family history (Formal Consensus; Agreement: 97.50%).  \n Individuals with a second primary cancer, either in the contralateral or ipsilateral breast, should be offered BRCA1/2  \ntesting (Formal Consensus; Agreement: 89.74%).  \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 12 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n \n Individuals with a personal history of breast cancer diagnosed at 65 years of age or younger who currently do not \nhave active disease should be offered BRCA1/2  testing if the result will inform their personal risk management or a \nfamily risk assessment (Formal Consensus; Agreement: 90%).  \n Individuals with a personal history of breast cancer diagnosed at age 66 or older who currently do not have active \ndisease but meet one of the following criteria should be offered BRCA1/2  testing if the result will inform their personal \nrisk management or a family risk assessment:  \no Their personal or family history suggests the possibility of a pathogenic variant . \no They were assigned male sex at birth.  \no They had triple- negative breast cancer . \no They are of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry or are members of a population with an increased prevalence of founder \nmutations (Type: Formal Consensus; Agreement: 94.87%) . \n Undergoing testing for high penetrance genes beyond BRCA1/2  (including PALB2, TP53, PTEN, STK11 , and CDH1 ) \nmay be helpful for clinical decision making and could help refine estimates of risk of second primary cancer as well as \ninforming family risk assessment. Therefore this testing should be offered to appropriate candidates (Formal \nConsensus; Agreement: 92. 31%).  \n Although there is no benefit for treatment of the index breast cancer from testing moderate penetrance breast cancer \ngenes, risk of second primary cancer or family risk assessment may be informed by such testing and may be offered \nto individuals undergoing BRCA1/2  testing when appropriate (Formal Consensus; Agreement: 87.50%).  \n An individual’s personal and family history should be considered if a multigene panel is ordered (Formal Consensus; Agreement: 91.43%).  \n VUS should not change management (Formal Consensus; Agreement: 88.57%).  \n The importance of individualized genetic consultation and counseling for selection of the appropriate test and to assist with interpretation and communication of results to the affected individual and/or family is highlighted.  \n \nEuropean Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO)  \nESMO’s recent clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis, treatment,  and follow -up of early breast cancer (Loibl et al., 2024) \nrecommend germline testing and genetic counseling for individuals with pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2  who meet \nnational criteria guidelines and/or those who are candidates for olaparib therapy.  \n \nA 2023 ESMO clinical practice guideline (Sessa et al.) addresses risk reduction and screening for cancer in HBOC  \nsyndrome. Per this guideline, germline genetic testing with multigene panels should be offered to individuals with \nsignificant family history (Grade of recommendation: A). Panels should be comprised of clinically validated HBOC genes (ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2, PTEN, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, TP53 ). The authors \npoint out that screening panels marketed today incorporate gene s beyond BRCA1/2 , and associated cancer risk varies \ngreatly with each gene. The importance of comprehensive genetic counseling to differentiate risks associated with various HBOC- associated genes is highlighted.  \n \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)  \nThe NCCN Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian and Pancreatic Cancer guidelines (v1.2025 ) present \nevidence- based criteria for genetic testing for hereditary breast , ovarian,  and/or pancreatic cancer , noting that an \nindividual’s personal and/or family history can often be explained by more than just one inherited cancer syndrome. Multi-\ngene testing simultaneously evaluates genes for hereditary cancer types associated with a specific family phenotype (or \nmultiple phenotypes). Phenotype- direct ed testing using tailored, multi -gene panel tests can be more efficient and cost -\neffective and increase potential for detection of P/LP variants  in individuals at  risk. For individuals who have tested \nnegative for a single syndrome , but whose personal/family history suggests hereditary susceptibility , such testing may \nalso prove helpful. These guidelines address genetic risk assessment, counseling, testing, and management based on \ntest results. T esting recommendations are separated into three categories: 1) clinically indicated; 2) may be considered; \n3) low probability that testing will find documented high- penetrance genes . \n \nPer NCCN guidelines, hereditary cancer testing is clinically indicated in the following general situations:  \n An individual has any blood relative with a  known P/LP variant in a cancer susceptibility gene.  \n An individual  has previously tested negative with limited testing  (e.g., single gene or absent deletion duplication \nanalysis),  meets testing criteria below , and desires  multi- gene testing . \n A known P/LP variant has been identified on tumor genomic testing that has clinical implications if also identified in \nthe germline.  \n Testing is performed to aid in systemic therapy and surgical decision- making . \n Individual meets Li -Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome/PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome or LS  testing criteria . \n \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 13 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Testing may be considered in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry without other risk factors or for a personal history \nof serous endometrial cancer  (EC).  \n \nBreast Cancer  \nFor individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer, testing for high- penetrance breast cancer susceptibility \ngenes ( e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, PALB2, PTEN, STK11 , and TP53 ) is clinically indicated in the following situations  \n(also see general testing criteria above) : \n Individual has a personal history of breast cancer  with the following features:  \no Diagnosed ≤ 50 years old . \no Diagn osed at any age and:  \n Used for treatment indications . \n Testing will aid in treatment decisions involving PARP inhibitors in the metastatic setting; or  \n Testing will aid in adjuvant treatment decisions with olaparib for high- risk, HER2 -negative breast cancer . \n Pathology/histology includes :  \n Triple-negative breast cancer . \n Multiple primary breast cancer (synchronous or metachronous) . \n– Lobular breast cancer with personal or family history of diffuse gastric cancer . \n Breast cancer  in an individual assigned male at birth.  \n Individual is of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry . \n Individual has at least one close blood relative with : \n Breast cancer at age 50 or younger . \n Male breast cancer . \n Ovarian, pancreatic, or metastatic, or high-  or very -high risk group prostate cancer . \n There are a t least three total diagnoses (including patient with breast cancer) of breast and/or prostate cancer \n(any grade) on the same side of the family . \n Individual is unaffected or affected but does not meet criteria above and:  \no Has a first - or second- degree blood relative that meets any above criteria (except unaffected individuals whose \nrelatives meet criteria only for systemic therapy decision- making) . \no Has a probability >  5% of a BRCA1/2 P/LP variant based on prior probability models (e.g., Tyrer -Cuzick, \nBRCAPro, CanRisk) . \n \nTesting may be considered with appropriate counseling and management in the following situations:  \n Individual has a personal history of breast cancer at age 65 or younger and does not meet any of the above criteria \n*Caution: The majority of those pathogenic variants ( PVs) will be in moderate penetrance genes, which are over -\nrepresented in older affected individuals. Access to an experienced genetic counseling team to discuss management options is especially important in this setting.  \n Individual has a personal history of breast cancer diagnosed at any age with one or more close blood relatives with intermediate- risk prostate cancer with intraductal/cribriform histology . \n Individual is unaffected or affected but does not meet any of the above criteria and has  a 2.5% –5% probability of \nBRCA1/2  P/LP variant based on prior probability models ( e.g., Tyrer -Cuzick, BRCAPro, CanRisk) . \n Individual has a personal history of malignant phyllodes tumors . \n There is a low probability (less than 2.5%) that testing will identify high- penetrance genes in the following situations:  \n Individual assigned female at birth who has been diagnosed with breast cancer at greater than 65 years of age with \nno close relatives  with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer . \n Individual is diagnosed with localized prostate cancer with Gleason Score <  7 and has no close relatives with breast, \novarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer . \n Note : Consideration of the limitations of unknown or limited family structure is indicated in those aged ≥  51 years . \n \nOvarian Cancer  \nFor individuals with a personal or family history of ovarian cancer, testing for ovarian cancer susceptibility genes ( e.g., \nATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1 , LS genes [MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, EPCAM ], PALB2, RAD51C , and RAD51D ) is clinically \nindicated in the following situations  (also see general testing criteria above) : \n Individual has a personal history of epithelial ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer) diagnosed at any age . \n Individual unaffected with ovarian cancer has family history including one of the following:  \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 14 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

NSGC notes the complexities of genetic testing and stres ses the importance of \ninvolving genetic counselors and other experts who are able to provide education regarding the appropriate utilization of such testing to avoid undo harm and/or unnecessary costs.  \n \nIn 2021, the NSGC published a new practice resource which notes the growing body of research that has emerged \nrelated to expanded genetic testing of genes other than BRCA1  and BRCA2  and the impact on risk assessment, \npsychosocial issues, medical management , and genetic assessment for individuals from families with moderate or high-\nrisk breast and or ovarian cancer  (Berliner et al., 2021) . The practice resource indicates that  little is known about clinical  \nmanagement for individuals with P/LP variants within less common, high- penetrance or moderate- penetrance genes and \nongoing research is being done in this area.  The NSGC recommends the following steps for cancer risk assessment:  \n Gathering personal medical and family history data.  \n Psychosocial assessment . \n Providing education focused on the basic principles of genetics and cancer . \n Discussion of cancer and P/LP risk and how personalized risk estimates are derived.  \n Facilitation of the informed consent process through discussion of the risks, benefits, limitations, and likelihood of \nidentifying a mutation with genetic susceptibility testing . \n Results disclosure (if applicable) . \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 15 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

The updated document recommends that primary care providers screen women who have a \npersonal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  \nmutations. This screening should be performed with one of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1  or BRCA2 ). Tools evaluated by the USPSTF include the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool, Manchester \nScoring System, Referral Screening Tool, Pedigree Assessment Tool, 7- Question Family History Screening Tool, \nInternational Breast Cancer Intervention Study inst rument (Tyrer -Cuzick) and brief versions of BRCAPRO. Women with \npositive screening results should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic test ing (Grade B \nrecommendation).  \n In addition, the USPSTF  (2019)  recommends against routine genetic counseling or BRCA testing for women for whom \npersonal or family history or ancestry is not associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the \nBRCA1  or BRCA2  genes (Grade D recommendation) .  \n \nHigh -Risk Colorectal Cancer Syndromes ( Including Lynch Syndrome  Associated \nCancers ) \nIn an effort to determine the yield and possible impact of multigene panel testing ( MGPT ) on clinical decision- making, \nCoughlin et al. (2022)  conducted a retrospective cohort study including 34,244 individuals with a history of colorectal \ncancer (CRC). All participants underwent MGPT using panel tests containing at least ten genes. The participants were \nlargely female (60.7%), White (70.6%) and 50 years of age or older (68.9%). A total of 4864 individuals (14.2%) were \nfound to have one or more P/LP germline variants and 3111 (9.1%) had a variant that is associated with increas ed \nCRC/polyposis risk. Another 3.1% had an otherwise clinically actionable P/LP variant. Notably, there was not a clear association of larger gene panels with a higher yield of clinically actionable P/LP variants. P/LP variants were more common in those wi th Hispanic ethnicity ( p < .001) and in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent ( p < .001). The overall \nrate of clinically actionable P/LP variants found on MGPT across all panel sizes, races , and ages was at least 7.9%. VUS \nwere identified in 13,094 individuals (38.2%). Based on these results, the authors concluded that MGPT of individuals with CRC identified high rates of clinically actionable variants across individuals of all ages and racial/ethnic groups regardless of panel size, which supports expandi ng germline genetic testing guidelines for these individuals. Noted limitations include \nthe collection of data from test requisition forms, limiting confirmation of clinical information, and the inclusion of all individuals with CRC, even if CRC was not the primary reason for the individual to undergo genetic evaluat ion. \n In a 2021 publication, Uson et a l. (included in the 2023 Hayes Precision Medicine Insight report discussed below) reported  \nthat using universal multi -gene panel testing instead of practice guideline criteria- based testing in CRC was associated \nwith a small but significant  increase in finding heritable gene mutations . To conduct this study, the authors used a \nprospective, multi -site design and a  > 80 gene NGS  platform to perform testing on individuals with CRC. A total of 361 \nadult s participate d (median age of 57 years ). Pathogenetic germline  variants were found in 15.5% (n = 56) of participants \nin the study and 9.4% (n  = 34) had clinically actional findings that would not have been detected with a CRC specific gene \npanel or if standard clinical practice criteria had been followed. Overall,  11% (1 in 1 0) had changes in their management \nbased on test results . Family cascade  testing was low  (16%) , which is a concerning observation and will require further \nstudy. Another concern was the demographic of the participants seen at the Mayo Clinic sites  where the study was \nconducted, which may limit generalization of study results. Family history was self -reported, which may also limit accuracy \nand completeness, and the follow up was relatively short, impacting the utility of survival analysis to address  outcomes \nfully. Lastly, the study was not able to track blood relatives that may have undergone cascade  testing elsewhere. The \nresearchers caution that further long- term follow up will be necessary to address outcomes on morbidity and cancer care \ndecision- making.  \n \nGupta et al. (2019) published insights regarding the NCCN updated guidelines for susceptibility screening for CRC  \nsyndromes, specifically around multi -gene cancer panels for hereditary CRC syndromes . For polyposis syndromes that \ninclude familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP), attenuated FAP (AFAP), MUTYH -associated polyposis ( MAP ), and other \nrare genetic causes of multiple adenomatous polyps, data suggested that there are many genes that may contribute to CRC risk including: AXIN2, GREM1, NTHL1, POLE, POLD1 , and MSH3 . Likewise, there are many genes that have been \nlinked to  LS which is associated with an increased risk for colon, endometrial and ovarian, gastric , pancreatic, biliary tract, \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 16 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

The use of a multigene panel can help \nwith the identification of LS  and manage the future risk of CRC or EC . The panel recommends universal screening of all \npatients with CRC or EC  at any age with tumor showing evidence of mismatch repair d eficiency  (dMMR), either by \nmicrosatellite instability ( MSI) or loss of mismatch repair (MMR ) protein expression.  \nUsing the ClinGen Clinical Validity framework, Seifert et al. (201 9) evaluated gene- disease associations in hereditary \nCRC. This study assessed 42 gene- disease pairs. Of all gene- disease pairs evaluated, 14/42 (33.3%) were Definitive, \n1/42 (2.4%) was Strong, 6/42 (14.3%) were Moderate, 18/42 (42.9%) were Limited, and 3/42 (7.1%) were either No \nReported Evidence, Disputed, or Refuted. The researchers state that providers should recognize that less than  60% of \ngenes on available panels have Strong or Definiti ve evidence of association.  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican College of Gastroenterology (ACG)  \nThe ACG published recommendations for the management of individuals with hereditary gastrointestinal cancer \nsyndromes, including genetic testing recommendations (Syngal et al., 2015). The authors note that genetic testing is \nwidely available and should be standard of care for individuals at increased risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome. The \nguidelines recommend targeted gene analysis for the syndrome most likely to be responsible for an individual’s \nsymptoms. The authors address multi -gene panels and NGS technology, noting that genetic specialists are increasingly \nusing NGS panels for individuals with more than one genetic syndrome on the differential diagnosis list, as testing for \nmultiple conditions at once can decrease costs and be time- efficient when compared to sequentially screening the \npossible list of genes. It is additionally noted, however, that even though there might be efficiency compared to sequential screening, the time to results is typically longer for large panels. The larg er the panel, the more likely it is that VUS  will be \nfound. In addition, the authors caution that these panels often include genes for which there is little data on how to \nmanage cancer risks, and sometimes the degree of cancer risk is unknown. In these situations, the clinician is no better \noff and must manage the patient based on family and medical history, which can cause confusion for the patient. At the \ntime of publication, the authors do not recommend multiple gene sequencing but  note that in the future,  it is likely  that at -\nrisk patients may be screened simultaneously for all hereditary cancer syndrome genes.  \n \nCollaborative Group of the Americas on  Inherited Gastrointestinal Cancer (CGA -IGC)  \nFor hereditary cancer syndromes associated with CRC and polyposis, MGPT  has been accepted, however the genes \nincluded on commercially available panels vary widely . The CGA -IGC performed an evidence review to determine which \ngenes should be included on a multigene panel for a n individual with a suspected hereditary CRC or polyposis syndrome \n(Heald et al., 2020). In addition, the group proposed updated genetic testing criteria. The collaborative group highlighted \nthe following genes associated with LS : MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM  and the genes associated with polyposis \nsyndromes: APC, BMPRIA, MUTYH, PTEN , SMAD4 , and STK11 . These genes were noted as the minimum genes that \nshould be included on a multigene panel for these conditions. The CGA -IGC recommends multigene panel for individuals \nwith the following : \n CRC diagnosed at before 50 years  of age . \n Multiple LS primary tumors . \n CRC and at least one first degree relative with CRC or EC. \n PREMM 5 score  ≥ 2.5% or MMRpro or MMRpredict score ≥ 5%. \n dMMR  CRC, not attributed to MLH1 promoter methylation.  \n Individuals  meeting any other genetic testing criteria.  \n ≥ 10 cumulative colorectal adenomas . \n ≥ 3 cumulative gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps . \n \nCollaborative Group of the Americas on Inherited Gastrointestinal Cancer (CGA -IGC)/National \nSociety of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)  \nIn 2022, the CGA -IGC and NSGC published a practice resource addressing genetic evaluation of LS  (Holter et al., 2022). \nThe resource indicates  that the term “Lynch syndrome ” should only be used when individuals have been identified to have \ngermline heterozygous P/LP variants in the MMR genes including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6  or PMS2  or 3’ terminal deletions \nof EPCAM . The following clinical criteria are provided for identifying individuals who should be evaluated for LS : \n Individual has a f amily  history of a known germline MMR pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant . \n Individual has a personal history of CRC or EC with any of the following characteristics:  \no Age of diagnosis less than 50 years . \no Tumor is dMMR: MSI -high or abnormal  MMR  immunohistochemistry (IHC) . \no Another LS -related cancer* . \no Family history of LS -related cancers in first  or second -degree relatives . \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 17 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

The \nguidelines address genetic risk assessment, counseling, testing, and management based on test results , and indicate that  \ngermline  multigene panel s are an alternative strategy to tumor -and family history -driven selection of individuals with CRC \nor EC  for testing, because they have greater sensitivity for identifying individuals affected with LS and other cancer risk \ngenes  than selecting specific germline testing based on family history or tumor -based criteria.  When used, germline \nMGPT  should include, at a minimum, the following CRC -related genes: APC, MUTYH, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, \nEPCAM, BMPR1A, SMAD4, PTEN, STK11, and  TP53 . For EC , the following genes should be included in germline \nMGPT : MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, PTEN, POLD1, POLE, and BRCA1/2. Use of panels  including genes \nbeyond those above should be based on factors such as age at presentation, phenotype of polyps, personal and family \nhistory of cancer , and patient/provider preference. The guideline further notes that commercially available multi -gene tests \nmay differ substantially on the specific genes analyzed by the panel, the total number of genes analyzed, and turn -around \ntime, among other things. NCCN advises that the choice of specific laboratory/test panel is critical and that multigene \ntesting is ideally offered with professional genetic expertise in cancer genetics, including pre-  and post -test counseling.  \n \nLynch Syndrome (LS) Testing Criteria \nLS-related cancers include colorectal, endometrial, gastric, ovarian, pancreatic, urothelial, brain (usually glioblastoma), \nbiliary tract, and small intestine, as well as sebaceous adenomas, sebaceous carcinomas, and keratoacanthomas as seen \nin Muir -Torre syndrome.  \nTesting for LS is recommended in the following situations : \n There is a k nown LS PV in the family . \n Indiv idual has LS -related cancer and any of the following:  \no Diagnosed at 49 years or younger . \no Diagnosed with a synchronous or metachronous LS -related cancer at any age . \no Has a first - or second- degree relative with an LS -related cancer diagnosed at 49 years of age or younger . \no Has two or more first - or second- degree relatives with an LS -related cancer regardless of age.  \n Individual has a family history of any of the following:  \no One or more first -degree relatives with a CRC or EC diagnosed at 49 years of age or younger . \no One or more first -degree relatives with a CRC or EC and a synchronous or metachronous LS -related cancer at \nany age.  \no Two or more first - or second- degree relatives with LS -related cancers including one or more diagnosed at age 49 \nor younger . \no Three or more first -or second- degree relatives with LS -related cancers at any age.  \n Individual has a five or greater percent  risk of MMR gene pathogenic variant based on predictive models  (PREMM 5, \nMMRpro, MMRpredict).  \no Individuals with personal history of CRC and/or EC  with a PREMM 5 score of 2 .5% or greater should be \nconsidered for MGPT . \no Individuals with no personal history of CRC and/or EC may use a PREMM 5 score of ≥  2.5% rather than ≥  5% to \nselect individuals for MMR testing, when used with clinical judgement . \n Personal history of a tumor with dMMR determined by PCR, NGS, or IHC , diagnosed at any age.  \n Personal history of a P/LP variant detected on tumor genomic testing that has clinical implications if also detected in germline testing.  \n \nTesting maybe be considered for individuals with a personal history of CRC or EC at 50 years of age or older and \nuntested for dMMR  status in a tumor or a documented absence of dMMR  in tumor.  \n \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 18 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Adenomatous  Polyposis Testing Criteria  \nTesting is recommended when : \n Individual has a personal history of twenty or more cumulative adenomas . \n Family history of a known pathogenic  variant in an adenomatous polyposis genes . \n Individual has multifocal/bilateral congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) . \n Individual has a personal history of a cribriform -morular variant of papillary thyroid cancer . \n There is a family history of polyposis and family is unwilling or unable to undergo testing . \n \nIn addition, testing may also be considered if:  \n Individual has  a personal history of a desmoid tumor, hepatoblastoma, unilateral CHRPE . \n Individual meets criteria for serrated polyposis syndrome ( SPS) and has at least some adenomas . \n Individual has a personal history of between 10 and 19 cumulative adenomas . \n For individuals with any cancer and a P/LP APC variant identified on tumor -only genomic testing, germline testing should \nbe considered for : \n Individuals meeting one or more of the other adenomatous testing criterion above after reevaluation of personal and family history . \n Individuals diagnosed with any cancer at less than 30 years of age . \n \nAge of onset, family history, and/or presence of other features  may influence whether genetic testing is offered in some \nsituation s. \n \nU.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer (USMSTF)  \nThe USMSTF is a group of CRC experts chosen by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) , American \nCollege of Gastroenterology  (ACG) , and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy  (ASGE) , and at times including \nother experts when needed for additional expertise. In 2022, this group published recommendations for diagnosis and \nmanagement of cancer risk in the gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis syndromes (Boland, et al. , 2022) , including \nthe following regarding genetic evaluation and testi ng: \n Individuals  with any of the following should undergo a genetic evaluation: two or more lifetime hamartomatous polyps, \na family history of hamartomatous polyps, or a cancer associated with a hamartomatous polyposis syndrome in first - \nor second- degree relatives. Genetic testing (if indicated) should be performed using a MGPT . (Strong \nrecommendation, low quality of evidence) . \n G enetic evaluation should be performed  for any individual with the following: 1) two or more histologically confirmed \nPeutz -Jeghers polyps, 2) any number of Peutz -Jeghers polyps in an individual who has a family history of Peutz -\nJeghers syndrome in a first -degree relative, 3) characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation in a person with a fam ily \nhistory of Peutz -Jeghers syndrome, 4) any number of Peutz -Jeghers polyps in a person with the characteristic \nmucocutaneous pigmentation of Peutz -Jeghers syndrome. (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) . \n G enetic evaluation for any individual with 1) five or more juvenile polyps of the colon or rectum , 2) two or more \njuvenile polyps in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, (3) any number of juvenile polyps and one or more first -\ndegree relative with juvenile polyposis syndrome is recommended. (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) . \n The task force suggests that individuals with SMAD4 pathogenic variants should be clinically evaluated for \nhemorrhagic telangiectasia at the time of the diagnosis, including screening for and appropriate management of cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations . (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence) . \n Individuals  with multiple gastrointestinal hamartomas or ganglioneuromas should undergo genetic evaluation for \nCowden’s syndrome and related conditions.  (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence) . \n \nOther Cancers or More Than One Hereditary Cancer Syndrome \nIn an effort to determine whether germline genetic screening using exome sequencing technology can  efficiently identify \ncarriers of HBOC and LS, Samadder et al. (2024) analyzed participants in the ongoing Tapestry study (ClinicalTrials.gov \nidentifier: NCT05212428). Tapestry is a health study that is investigating the necessary processes for large-scale genomic \nsequencing and dissemination of results for CDC Tier One heritable conditions (HBOC, LS , and familial \nhypercholesterolemia), as well as evaluating downstream clinical impact. Samadder and colleagues focused on subjects \nthat had undergone Exome+ sequencing (Helix Inc., San Mateo, CA) for specific results suggesting HBOC ( BRCA1/2 ) \nand LS ( MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2  and EPCAM ), performing a corresponding chart review to compile demographics \nalong with personal and family history of cancer. Of the 44,306 Tapestry enrollees with Exome+ results/interpretation at \nthe time of evaluation, 1.24% (n  = 550) were carriers for either HBOC or LS genes, including 387 HBOC gene carriers \n(27.2% BRCA1 , 42.8% BRCA2 ) and 163 LS gene carriers (12.3% MSH6 , 8.8% PMS2 , 4.5% MLH1 , 3.8% MSH2 , and \n0.2% EPCAM ). Over half of the 550 carriers identified were newly diagnosed as carriers. Notably, 39.2% of all HBOC and \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 19 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n LS gene carriers did not meet NCCN criteria for genetic testing; additionally, these criteria were more infrequently met in \nunderrepresented minority populations than in populations that self -identified as white (51.5% vs 37.5%, p = .028). The \nauthors concluded that their findings from this multisite, prospective, cohort study underscore the need for broader use of \ngermline testing for improved screening/detection of individuals affected with HBOC and LS cancer predisposition \nsyndrome s. Study results indicate that screening via Exome+ could potentially detect approximately 50% of CDC Tier One \ncondition carriers who would otherwise not be identified based on current processes. Several limitations, however, were \nidentified, including lack of language options for completion of the electronic interface with Helix Labs (only English was \navailable), leading to underrepresentation of minority populations. In addition, the exome sequencing identified carriers of \nonly small P/LP variations such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels, which led to some false negative \nresults due to lack of detection of copy number variants that are estimated to be pathogenic in 5- 25% of HBOC/LS \nmutation carriers. Lastly, some of the authors had affiliations with laboratories that manufacture genetic tests, including \nthe Exome+ test used in this study. Further high- quality studies evaluating best approaches for population- based genetic \nscreening is needed before such screening can be adopted as standard practice.  \n \nA 2023 Hayes Precision Medicine Insight found minimal support in the published literature, and no/unclear support in the \nexisting published guidelines , for the use of multisyndrome panel testing to assist with clinical management of individuals \nwith a suspected hereditary cancer syndrome. Four clinical studies addressing multisyndrome panel testing were identified, but none compared the use of comprehens ive multisyndrome panels with targeted testing or reported clinical \noutcomes.  \n \nIn a retrospective review of clinical data and test results from individuals with suspected hereditary pheochromocytomas  \nand paragangliomas (PPGLs), Horton et al. (2022) shared the results of MGPT  performed using PGLNext (Ambry \nGenetics Aliso Viejo, CA)  in this group of  clinically and ancestrally diverse individuals . Existing practice guidelines \nrecommend sequential gene testing strategies determined by individual clinical features; however,  the authors indicate \nthat these guidelines were developed prior to the routine availability and use of MGPT.  A total of 1727 individuals who \nreceived targeted MGPT related to suspicion of hereditary PPGL were included in the review. The analysis revealed that \n27.5% of the individuals had a P/LP, 9.0% had a VUS and 63.1% of results were negative. The PVs were mos t often \nfound in SDHB  (40.4%) , then SDHD (21.1%), SDHA  (10.1%), VHL (7.8%), SDHC (6.7%), RET (3.7%) and MAX  (3.6%). \nIndividuals with extra- adrenal location of disease, early age of onset, positive family history of PPGL and multiple tumors \nwere most likely to have PVs (85.9%). Per the results of this study, limiting genetic tests to SDHB/C/D only would miss \napproximately 1/3 (32.8%) of individuals with PVs. Overall, the researchers concluded that the data from this study \nindicate high diagnostic yield in individuals with and without known risk factors, significant contribution to diagnostic yield \nfrom rare genes, and a low rate of inconclusive results  which supports the use of universal testing with MGPT for  all \nindividuals with PPGL, regardless of tumor type, age of onset, metastatic disease, syndromic features, family history , or \nfunctional statu s. \n \nNölting et al. (2022) published a review integrating current guidelines and expert opinions regarding the personalized \nmanagement of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma  (PPGLs ). PPGLs have the highest rate of heritability among all \ntumors with approximately 30% of 35% of Caucasian individuals (lesser percentage in Chinese population) showing \ngermline mutations. In addition, 35% to 40% of Caucasians (higher in the Chinese population) have impact from somatic \ndriver mutations. The article asserts that accurate genetic testing in these individuals is indispensable and recommends \nsuch testing for every affected individual, because identification of the molecular cluster associated with the P PGL \n(pseudohypoxia cluster 1  (1A and 1B), kinase -signaling cluster  2, and Wnt signaling cluster  3) has been shown to \npositively impact management and overall outcomes. The preferred testing technique is NGS  so that all important genetic \nvariations can be identified via one single test.  \n \nUson et al. (2021) documented the results of a prospective, multisite study which used an  NGS panel with greater than 80 \ngenes to perform germline sequencing on 250 individuals  with pancreatic cancer . Included individuals were not selected \nfor family history of cancer or age. Pathogenic germline  variants (PGVs) were found in 15.2% of participants, with two \nparticipants testing positive for more than one PGV. VUS were found in 44.4% of participants. Individuals  with a family \nhistory of cancer were associated with a higher risk of PGV. 68% of PGV carriers had mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, \nPALB2, ATM, CHEK2, NBN , and RAD51C . The most common PGVs were found in BRCA2  (22.5%) ATM (17.5%) and \nCHEK2  (10%). Overall, in this study, one in six individuals with pancreatic cancer were carriers of PGV. The authors \nrecommend that multigene germline testing should be used in individuals with pancreatic cancer to aid in selection of \ntreatment, prognostication, and counseling of family members regarding risk.  \n In a 2021 publication, Samadder et al . (included in the Hayes 2023 Precision Medicine Insight report discussed above) \nreported on a prospective multicenter cohort study examining the prevalence of PGVs in individuals with cancer through \nthe use of a universal approach rather than targeted testing based on clinical practice guidelines. A total of 2984 \nindividuals with solid tumor cancers were studied. Participants were not selected based on cancer type, disease state, \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 20 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n family history, age,  or ethnicity. Germline sequencing using NGS with greater than 80 genes was provided to the \nparticipants . The researchers were looking to compare this universal strategy to the standard guideline- directed approach \nand also assess the uptake of cascade family variant testing. PGVs were detected in 397 participants (13.3%) , and 1415 \nparticipants (47.4%) were found to have VUS . Clinically actionable findings that would not have been detected by family \nhistory or phenotype- based testing criteria were identified in 192 participants . Of those with high -penetrance PGV, \nmodifications in treatment were made for 42 study subjects . A younger age of diagnosis (mean age was 61.4 years) was \nassociated with the presence of PVG, and onl y 17.6% of participants (n = 70) with PGVs had members of their family \nundergoing FVT. The authors concluded that  the universal MGPT  of individuals with a solid tumor cancer was associated \nwith a higher rate of detection of heritable variants than the predicted yield of guideline- based targeted testing in this \nstudy . Despite being free to family members, uptake of cascade FVT was low. Noted limitations include the lack of long-\nterm follow -up for assess ment of cancer -related deaths  and morbidity related to prophylactic surgery, targeted therapy,  or \npreventative screening.  Additionally, guidelines addressing family history and need for testing used by the expert \nreviewers for the study underwent a change during the course of the study which may have impacted outcome. Lastly the \ndemographics of participants in this study may  not mirror those in other regions which may limit generalization to other \npopulations.  \n LaDuca et al. (2020) evaluated 32 cancer predisposition genes in order to study the effect of MGPT  for hereditary \ncancers. The cohort consisted of 165,000 patients referred for MGPT , and the researchers assessed phenotype- specific \nPV frequencies, cancer risk associations, and performance of genetic testing criteria. The study identified extensive \ngenetic heterogeneity with the predisposition to cancer types commonly referred for germl ine testing (breast, ovarian, \ncolorectal, uterine/endometrial, pancreatic,  and melanoma). Individuals with ovarian cancer had the highest PV \nfrequencies (13.8%). Fewer than half of the PVs identified were in individuals that met the testing criteria for only \nBRCA1/2  (33.1%) or only LS  (46.2%). For individuals that did not meet the testing criteria, 5.8% had PVs in BRCA1/2  and \n26.9% had PVs in LS genes . \n \nMuth et al. (2019) discussed pheochromocytoma  and paraganglioma (P PGL), which are rare tumors stemming from the \nchromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla ( pheochromocytoma) or the sympathetic or parasympathetic extra- adrenal \nparaganglia ( paraganglioma ), in their publication of genetic testing and surveillance guidelines related to management of \nthese conditions for afflicted individuals and their family members. The authors indicate that at least 30% of PPGLs  are \npart of hereditary syndromes and approximately  20% of hereditary PPGLs  are caused by PGVs in genes of the succinate \ndehydrogenase complex (SDHx), TMEM127  or MAX . They state at a minimum, testing for FH, NF1, RET, SDHB, SDHD \nand VHL for individuals with P PGL should be done, but also recommend MEN1, SDHA, SDHAF2, SDHC,TMEM127  and \nMAX . First degree relatives (and second- degree relatives for SDHD and SDHAF2 , which are maternally imprinted) should \nbe offered carrier testing.  \n \nIn a study by Gardner et al. (2018), 630 individuals (84% of whom had a family history of cancer) were tested with a 27 -\ngene inherited cancer panel. Of these individuals, 65 were determined to have variants classified as P/LP  across 14 \ngenes (10.3%). Only 42% of these variants occurred in classic HBOC or LS -associated genes, while 58% were observed \nin high or moderate to low-risk genes on the panel. The researchers concluded that there is utility to using multi -gene \npanels over single gene testing,  particul arly in those with an inherited predisposition to cancer.  \n Rednam et al.  (2017)  discussed  the genes related to hereditary PPGL  syndrome in their 2017 publication  on Von Hippel -\nLindau and hereditary PPGL  syndrome . Genes related to hereditary PPGL  include the SDHx genes, MAX, TMEM127  and \npotentially HIF2α EGLN1 , and KIF1 β as well as genes that are components of other hereditary tumor predisposition \nsyndromes including RET, VHL, NF1 , and FH . The authors notes that up to 35% of PPGLs  are hereditary and diagnosis is \nbased on molecular genetic testing which should be offered to any affected individual.  \n An analysis of 252,223 individuals  (most of whom were suspected to have HBOC or LS)  was performed by Rosenthal et \nal. (2017) through the use of a 25- gene pan -cancer panel. Of these individuals, the majority (92.8%) met testing criteria \nfor HBOC and/or LS. PVs were identified in 6.7% of the tested individuals , with the most commonly identified PVs found in \nBRCA1/2  (42.2%), other breast cancer genes (32.9%), and LS genes (13.2%). However, half of the PVs  in individuals \nwho met only HBOC criteria were in non- BRCA1/2  genes. Likewise, in individuals who met LS criteria, half of the \npathogenic variants identified were in non- LS genes. These researchers suggest that a pan- cancer panel may provide \nimproved identification of PVs over single- syndrome testing.  \n Bholah and Bunchman (2017) published a review of the literature regarding PPGL  in which they demonstrated that the \ngenerally accepted estimate of  10% of cancers being hereditary  may not apply to PPGL . They noted that the European-\nAmerican -Pheochromocytoma- Paraganglioma- Registry (EAPPR) has released data showing that 80% of individuals in \ntheir registry had a germline mutation, compared to previous smaller pediatric case series which  estimated a germline \nmutation prevalence of 30- 40%. Genes that are involved in PPGL  include genes associated with  known neuroendocrine \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 21 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n syndromes such as von Hippel Lindau ( VHL), multiple endocrine neoplasia type II ( RET) and neurofibromatosis I ( NF1), \nas well as mitochondrial related genes. These include the subunits for succinate dehydrogenase, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, \nSDHD and SDHAF2 , and the TMEM, HIPF2A  and MAX  genes. Variants in these genes can cause rare autosomal \ndominant PPGL  syndromes with varying penetrance.  \n A retrospective study by Babic et al. (2017) analyzed pediatric PPGLs  to determine the role of genetic testing. Of 55 \npediatric participants, 44 (80%) had a germline mutation with the majority found to have either VHL (38%) or SDHB  (25%) \nmutation. The authors concluded that the majority of pediatric patients with PPGL  likely have detectable germline \nmutations and thus, genetic testing may be helpful to guide treatment.  \n Nguyen et al. (2017) published a retrospective review of the use of a 19 gene hereditary cancer panel in individuals diagnosed with kidney cancer. Participants were tested at a commercial laboratory from August 2013 to June 2016. \nClinical characteristics such as age, gender, age of diagnosis, ordering institution, kidney cancer histology, personal history , and cancer history were obtained from test requisitions. In total, 1235 participants with renal cell carcinoma had \ntesting. The majority of the cohort was Caucasian (64%) and male (54%). The average age of diagnosis was 46. Histology was available on 942 participants and common tumor histology such as clear cell, papillary and chromophobe \nkidney tumors was present in 67% of these. The remainder reported less common and mixed histology. Overall, 859 had only kidney cancer, 283 had an additional primary cancer, and 93 had more than two primary cancers. A positive family history for cancer was reported in 1007 participants , and of these, 369 reported a family history of kidney cancer. Half of \nall cases were referred by university -based hospitals, 44% were referred from non -university hospitals, and 4.5% came \nfrom private practice clinicians. Genetics providers referred 81% of cases, oncologists referred 14%, non -oncology \nphysicians  referred  1%, and other healthcare providers referred the remainder. Overall, 6.1% had a PV identified, 18% \nhad a VUS , and the remainder had a negative result. Mutations were found in 15 of the 19 genes in the panel. The genes \nwith the  highest rate of mutations were FLCN, FH, MITF and SDHB . The authors note that their study was limited by the \nretrospective review and the reliance on submitted histology information and not a centralized pathology review. It was \nadditionally noted that panel tests are relatively new, and the larger the panel,  the more likely that VUS are found. The \noutcomes and decisions by treating physicians were not available, but it has been hypothesized that clinicians may act \nand medically intervene for VUS where it may not be warranted. However, this is the first publication to report on the \nresults for a large cohort for kidney cancer patients undergoing multi -gene hereditary cancer panel testing.  \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)  \nAn ASCO  multidisciplinary panel of experts developed recommendations guiding the use of germline multigene panels for \nindividuals with cancer in 2024 . The recommendations were based on a systematic review of 52 existing guidelines and \nconsensus statements and 14 studies addressing germline and somatic genetic testing in a wide spectrum of diseases and were published as an ASCO guideline (Tung et al., 2024). Recommendations are summarized as follows:  \n All individuals with cancer should have a comprehensive family history taken and recorded (Evidence Quality: Not \nrated; Strength of recommendation: Strong) . \n When indicated, germline testing using a multigene panel should be offered to individuals diagnosed with cancer if \nthere is more than one relevant gene (Evidence Quality: Not rated; Strength of recommendation: Strong) . \no The panel should, at a minimum, include at least the more strongly recommended genes for the individual based on personal and family history of cancer and may include less strongly recommended genes as well . \no When benefits can be clearly identified, a broader panel may be ordered; the ordering clinician should ensure that any potential harms from uncertain results are mitigated. \no Smaller gene panels by be applied initially if results are needed quickly for treatment decision making; larger \npanels can then be order ed later. \n If germline testing is offered, the genes  in the following table  are recommended for inclusion in multigene panels for \nthe indicated population of individuals with cancer. In addition, because of the importance and prevalence of BRCA1, \nBRCA2 , and the LS genes MLH1, MLH2, MSH6, PMS2 , and EPCAM , it is reasonable to use panels including these \ngenes for any individual with cancer undergoing germline genetic testing  (Evidence Quality: Not rated; Strength of \nrecommendation: Strong) . \n \nCancer Type  More Strongly Recommended  Less Strongly Recommended  \nBreast cancer  BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 , CDH1, PTEN, \nSTK11, TP53  ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, RAD51C, RAD51D, \nNF1 \nColorectal cancer  APC, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, \nMUTYH, NTHL1,  PMS2, POLD1, POLE , \nBMPR1A, SMAD4, STK11, TP53  AXIN2, CHEK2, MBD4, GREM1, MSH3, PTEN, RNF43  \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 22 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

Additionally, for families in which pathogenic variants are identified, the facilitation of cascade testing and support services will require assistance from genetic counselors or other genetic experts. Finally, the ASCO expert panel notes that although large germline testing panels  are \nbecoming more com mon,  it is important to balance the benefits vs harms with these panels; broad panels may detect \nimportant PVs, but without appropriate interpretation of results, unnecessary anxiety or even inappropriate prevention \npractices and/ or screening could occur.  \n Stoffel et al. (2019) published a provisional clinical opinion resulting from ASCO’s expert panel literature review on pancreatic cancer. There were several sections regarding genetic testing in Research Question 2 “Which individuals should undergo genetic  testing for predisposition to pancreatic cancer?” ; the provisional clinical opinion indicates that all \npatients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma should undergo risk assessment for those hereditary cancer syndromes that are associated with pancreatic cancer.  Testing and assessment of risk should include a review of family history of cancer. The \nopinion also stated that germline genetic testing for cancer susceptibility should be considered in those with pancreatic cancer and unremarkable family history.  \n Genetic testing for cancer susceptibility may be efficient in circumstances where the medical and family history of a n \nindividual  requires  evaluation of multiple high- penetrance genes that have established clinical utility. Because such panels \nmight include genes with low to moderate penetrance, and results could include VUS , it is recommended that providers \nwith particular expertise in cancer risk assessment should be involved in the ordering and interpretation of MGPTs;  \nespecially those that include genes of uncertain clinical utility and genes not suggested by the patient’s personal and/or family history (Robson et al., 2015).  \n \nNCCN \nProstate Cancer  \nNCCN Practice Guidelines for Prostate Cancer ( v4.2024) direct the user  to the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial \nHigh-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic  and the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High Risk \nAssessment: Colorectal, Endometrial and Gastric, and indicate that the criteria in those guideline should be referenced at \nthe time of initial diagnosis of prostate cancer, and if applicable, at recurrence. Germline testing should be considered for appropriate candidates where the information obtained could impact prostate cancer treatment and/or clinical trial options, management of risk for other cancers, and potential risk in family members. If criteria in the above referenced guidelines are met, germline multigene testing should include at least BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, HOXB13, MLH1, \nMSH2, MSH6 , and PMS2 . In addition, individuals with prostate cancer undergoing tumor molecular analysis should be \ncounseled  that tumor testing using DNA sequencing may reveal germline findings as  well. \n \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma  \nNCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma ( v3.2024) recommend germline genetic testing using \ncomprehensive gene panels for hereditary cancer  for any individual with confirmed pancreatic cancer and also those for \nwhom there is a clinical suspicion for heritable susceptibility. The guideline directs the user to the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic and the NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial \nHigh-Risk Assessment: Colorectal , Endometrial and Gastric  (for pancreatic cancer in LS). Genetic  counseling is \nrecommended for individuals  with pancreatic cancer who test positive for a pathogenic mutation ( ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, \nCDKN2A, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, STK11 , TP53 ) or have a positive family history of cancer, especially \npancreatic cancer, regardless of mutation status.  \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 24 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors  \nNCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors  (v2.2024) address genetic counseling and \ntesting for individuals with neuroendocrine tumors  (NETs) , noting that the introduction of multigene genetic testing for \nhereditary endocrine neoplasias has quickly changed the clinical approach to genetic testing in these individuals. Because \nof the potential overlap in various heritable endocrine neoplasias, it is suggested that multigene testing may have greater \nefficiency in many situations.  Genes associated with hereditary endocrine neoplasia syndromes include MAX, SDHA, \nSDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, TMEM127, MEN1, RET, CDKN1B, NF1, TSC1, TSC2, and VHL. Hereditary cancer \npredisposition syndromes associated with adrenocortical carcinoma include Li -Fraumeni ( TP53 ), LS (MLH1, \nEPCAM/MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 ), multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN1 ) and familial adenomatous polyposis ( APC). The \ninterpretation of genetic testing in these conditions, however , can be complex and subjective. Per the v2.2024 guideline,  \ngenetic risk evaluation and testing for hereditary endocrine neoplasia syndromes is recommended for individuals who \nmeet any of the following criteria:  \n Individual has adrenocortical carcinoma.  \n Individual has pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas . \n Individual has a parathyroid adenoma or primary hyperparathyroidism prior to 30 years of age, has multiple parathyroid adenomas, has multigland hyperplasia (without an obvious secondary cause), or has recurrent primary \nhyperparathyroidism . \n There is clinical suspicion for MEN2 due to medullary thyroid carcinoma or other combination of MEN2- related \ncharacteristics . \n A mutation was identified on tumor genomic testing that has clinical implications if identified in the germline.  \n A close blood relative as a known P/LP variant in a cancer susceptibility gene.  \n A first -degree relative has met one of the criteria above but is not available for testing.  \n There is a clinical suspicion of MEN1 due to two or more of the following or one of the following and a family history of \none or more of the following:  \no Primary hyperparathyroidism . \no Duodenal/pancreatic NET . \no Pituitary adenoma.  \no Foregut carcinoid (lung, thymic, or gastric) . \n \nGenetic testing and risk evaluation may be considered for the following:  \n Individual has gastrinoma (duodenal/pancreatic or type two  gNET) . \n Individual has multifocal PanNETs . \n Individual has d uodenal/pancreatic NET at any age.  \n There are o ther combinations of tumors or cancers in the patient and/or their family members . \n \nPolygenic Risk Scor es (PRS)  \nA PRS is an evaluation of the risk of a specific condition based on the combined effect of many different genetic variants. \nPRSs may include variants that are related to genes of known function and also with variants that have no known \nassociation with genes pertinent to a particular condition or disease (NCI Dictionary of Genetics Terms (2024).  There is \ncurrently insufficient evidence to support the use of PRS for assessing hereditary cancer risk.  \n \nUsing a combined analysis of two prospective cohort studies (Malmö Diet and Cancer Study [MDCS] in Sweden; Health \nProfessionals Follow -Up Study [HPFS] in the United States) , Plym et al. (2024) investigated the differences in risk of early \nprostate cancer death in men with higher vs. lower genetic risk. A combination of modifiable lifestyle behaviors and \ngenetic risk were used to categorize study participants, with a polygeni c risk score  (PRS)  above median or a family history \nof cancer defining participants at higher genetic risk. Participants  not meeting this criteria (33%) were categorized as \nlower risk.  A total of 19,607 men were included in the evaluation, with a median age of 59 years for MDCS and 65.1 years \nfor HPFS.  A total of 107 deaths by age 75 and 337 deaths after age 75 occurred due to prostate cancer. Those \nparticipants with high er genetic risk, as assessed by a PRS which included 400 genetic risk variants  and/or  family history \nincluding at least one first -degree relative with any cancer or prostate/breast cancer,  had increased rates of both early and \nlate prostate cancer death (HR, 3.26; 95% CI , 1.82- 5.84, HR; 2.26; 95% CI , 1.70-3.01, respectively) as well as  overall \nhigher lifetime risks of death due to prostate cancer (3.1% vs 1.3% [MDCS] and 2.3% vs 0.6% [HPFS]). Of the total early \nprostate cancer deaths, men at higher genetic risk made up 88% (94/107) ; 36% of those men (95% CI 12% -60%) were \nprojected to be pre ventable through the performance of behaviors such as maintaining healthy weight, not smoking, \nmaximizing physical activity , and consuming a healthy diet. The authors concluded that the results from this 20- year follow \nup study suggest that men with the genetic predisposition for prostate cancer make up the large majority of individuals \nwith early prostate cancer death and should receive focus ed attention  for prostate cancer prevention tactics.  Noted \nlimitations include lack of randomization and assessment of factors only at entry into the study. Participants were limited \nto men of European ancestry, and differences in prostate cancer testing and treatment could account for some of the \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 25 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n association between healthy lifestyle and prostate cancer death. Further study that better defines appropriate screening \ntechnology for genetic risk as well as the impact of targeted interventions related to genetic results are required.  \n \nIn a 2023 systematic review and meta- analysis, Siltari et al. (2023) analyzed the existing evidence addressing the use of \nPRS as a predictor of prostate cancer in Caucasian men.  A total of 59 studies were included in the assessment , with 16 \nstudies/17 separate analyses used in the primary meta- analysis. In all, 20,786 cases and 69,106 controls were identified.  \nThe researchers found that the ability of PRS to detect men with prostate cancer was modest (pooled area under the \ncurve (AUC) 0.63, 95% CI , 0.62- 0.64) and had moderate consistency J(I2 64%). When PRS was combined with clinical \nvariables, the pooled AUC increased to 0.74 (0.68- 0.81). A very limited increase in AUC was demonstrated when \nincremental single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assessments were added. Overall, the authors interpret these findings \nto indicate that PRS accuracy is comparable to prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing or family history and note that the optimal method for calculating PRS is unclear  at this time . \n \nMbuya- Bienge et al. performed a critical assessment of the use of PRS generated by  SNPs to help predict breast cancer \nrisk in the general population through a 2023 systematic review. Included studies  described development or validation of a \nbreast cancer risk prediction model using a PRS and reported a measure of predictive performance. Studies that \nincorporated individuals with a history of breast cancer and/or known genetic risk, or those that focused on any specific \npopulation were excluded. A total of 37 articles  (29 of which used both genetic and non- genetic risk factors)  exploring \nseven different risk prediction tools , were reviewed. The majority of the models (55%) were created based on populations \nof European ancestry; these generally performed better than models developed based on other ancestry groups. Overall, \nmodels that combined PRS with both genetic and non -genetic risk factors had better discriminatory accuracy (AUC from \n0.52 to 0.77) than those models that used PRS alone (AUC from 0.48 to 0.68) , irrespective of the number of SNPs in the \nPRS.  Based on these results, the aut hors concluded that breast cancer risk prediction models combining  PRS with \ngenetic and non- genetic risk factors appeared to be  the most accurate, but additional study is required to better \nunderstand how these tools may be refined and applied in clinical practice.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)  \nA 2023 ACMG statement (Abu -El-Haija et al.) addressed the clinical application of PRS, citing several points to consider \nregarding the use of this technology , given the limited evidence for clinical utility at this time. The document points out that \na low PRS does not rule out significant risk o f the disease/condition in question and could have poor predictive value if the \nindividual considered for testing is of a different population than that from which the PRS was derived. In addition, isolate d \nPRS testi ng for clinical situations in which there is a suspected/known monogenic etiology is not appropriate. Medical \nmanagement based on PRS results should be evidence based; however, at present, limited evidence exists to support the \nuse of PR S to guide intervention. It is important that individuals considering PRS have a discussion with their provider or \ncounselor for discussion of test limitations and information regarding how PRS results may guide clinical management. \nSuch management should be consistent with best practices documented in evidence- based professional society \nguidelines with applicable expertise (when such guidelines exist). Overall, the ACMG does not support the clinical \nimplementation of PRS tools unless the provider and the individual under consideration for such testing have a thorough understanding of the limitations of PRSs and how individual results may be used to guide appropriate clinical care.  \n \nGenetic Testing of BRCA1/2  or Multi -Gene Hereditary Cancer Panels  With RNA Testing  \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of concurrent RNA panel testing as part of genetic testing of BRCA1/2  or \nin multigene hereditary cancer panels. The quality of existing studies is low due to small study populations, short follow -up \ntimes , and lack of randomization and appropriate control groups.  While RNA testing may clarify certain variants identified \nfrom DNA testing, more high- quality studies are needed before RNA panels are broadly used.  \n A recent study by Landrith et al. (2020) reported on a collaboration of Ambry Genetics with 19 other clinical institutions. \nThe researchers evaluated 18 tumor suppressor genes in 345 samples from healthy donors to develop splicing profiles. \nThey then assessed the utility of this splicing profile on 1000 individuals with suspected hereditary cancer syndromes. The \nRNA testing coupled with DNA testing was performed and the RNA testing identified seven subjects with PVs that would \nhave been negative or inconclusive with DNA testing alone. For six of the seven, medical management changes would likely be recommended. This analysis showed a 9.1% relative increase in diagnostic yield when RNA testing is performed, although the study did not clarify what proportion of variants received new classification or confirmation  from RNA testing \nand what proportion were only detected from using a concurrent RNA panel. Further  studies are required to aid in the \ndevelopment of standards for interpretation of findings associated with RNA testing.  \n Karam et al. (2019) evaluated individuals with inconclusive variants after DNA testing to determine if RNA testing \nimproved the data. The study included individuals and/or families with HBOC , LS, and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. \nOnly 93 of 909 eligible families  sent in additional tests. The RNA testing results clarified the interpretation of 49 of 56 \n\n \nGenetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer  Page 26 of 31 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange  Medical Policy  Effective  04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n inconclusive cases (88%) studied. However only 26 (47%) were reclassified as clinically actionable and the remaining 23 \n(41%) were clarified as benign. An additional section of this study evaluated 307,812 results from individuals that had \nundergone only DNA testing ; the researchers determined that 7265 of these had inconclusive variants that affect splicing. \nThe authors concluded that  approximately 1 in 43 individuals could potentially benefit from RNA testing if performed in \nevery individual undergoing genetic assessment for hereditary cancer . The researchers call out several limitations, \nincluding participant availability to submit additional blood samples for RNA genetic testing and limited medical \nmanagement data due to the number of surveys completed. Studies which include clinical impact of concurrent RNA /DNA  \ngenetic testing are needed to provide a full assessment of potential impact of RNA panel testing.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n This section is to be used for informational purposes only.

In the brain, the FMR1 gene is responsible for producing a protein essential for development of \nconnections of the nerve cells . Alterations , or mutations, in the genetic material of the FMR1 gene can \nresult in disorders such as Fragile X syndrome, premature ovarian insufficiency, and the neurologic \ndisease Fragile X -associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).  FXTAS  primarily affects men over the \nage of 50 and is associ ated with signs and symptoms including tremor, ataxia, and dementia.  \n \nFragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and the most common \ncause of autism linked to a single gene. Associated with physical, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities, \nFragile X syndrome has an X -linked dominant inheritance pattern. Female offspring inherit an X \nchromosome from each parent, whereas male offspring always inherit the X chromosome from their \nmother and the Y chromosome from their father. This means that the FMR1 gene is inherited by females \nfrom their mother or father and  by males from their mother only. Prevalence and symptoms of Fragile X \nsyndrome in females are often milder than in males because with two X chromosomes, one X \nchromosome may compensate for the other with the mutation.  \nIn these conditions, the pattern of the building blocks of the FMR1 gene, or trinucleotides, are altered  by \nan increased repeat of patterns of nucleotides cytosine -guanine -guanine ( CGG ) on the FMR1 gene. \nDependent upon the degree of increased CGG repeats, the mutation is referred to as eithe r a premutation \nor a full mutation , and can change  over generations by inheritance. Clinical signs and symptoms of \nFragile X syndrome present with full mutation of the CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene while clinical presentation of FXTAS or premature ovarian i nsufficiency may develop in individuals with the FMR1 \nCGG premutation.  \n• Normal 5 -44 CGG repeats . \nPremutation 55- 200 CGG repeats means they carry the unstable mutation and can expand in future \ngenerations.  \nFull mutation > 200 CGG repeats  \n\nPage 2 of 4  Disclaimer____________________________________________________________________ \n \nCoverage is limited to that outlined in Medicaid Rule  or Health Care Administrative Rules that pertains to \nthe member’s  aid category.

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered. In particular, a patient who had negative germline BRCA1 and 2\ntesting, who is from a family with no pathogenic variants, should be considered for \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results.

The USPSTF guideline recommended:10\nWhen a woman's personal or family history of cancer is consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family \nhistory of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry \nassociated with breast cancer susceptibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) gene mutations with\nan appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from \nfamilies with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations \nare more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for \nthese specific mutations.\"\nNote  This benefit/harm statement only applies to those jurisdictions that do not have \nMedicare guidance. Based upon the guidelines and evidence provided in the clinical \npolicy, following EviCore's criteria for BRCA analysis will ensure that testing will be \navailable to those members most likely to benefit from a genetic diagnosis. For those \nnot meeting criteria, it ensures alternate diagnostic strategies are considered. \nHowever, it is possible that some members who have the condition, but have non-\nstandard features, will not receive an immediate approval for testing.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

All services must be rendered with the same amount,  \nduration, and scope available to FFS members.\nWhole Genome Sequencing Overview/Scope\nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is defined as the sequencing  of the entire human genome, \nincluding protein-coding regions (exons) and  noncoding regions. WGS captures most genomic \nvariation in a single test and is  useful for patients with rare disorders where hypothesis-driven \napproaches have  failed to produce a diagnosis. WGS can identify or confirm the genetic \netiology  of a disorder in patients (procedure code 81425). When needed for additional  \ndiagnostic insight, comparator genomes can be used from a relative such as  parents or \nsiblings (procedure code 81426). Reevaluation of the genome is also  available when needed \nfor additional diagnostic yield (procedure code 81427).  Procedure codes 81425 and 81427 \nmay be a benefit once per lifetime with any  provider. Procedure code 81426 may be a benefit \nup to a maximum of twice per  lifetime.\nPrior Authorization Requirements\nPrior authorization may be granted for WGS for individuals  under 21 years of age when it is \nconsidered medically necessary, which requires  that all the following criteria are met:\nThe individual has received pretest genetic counseling.\nThe individual has been evaluated by a physician  board-certified in one of the following \nfields:\nMedical genetics\nMaternal-fetal medicine\nNeonatology\nNeurology\nDevelopmental pediatrics\nThis evaluation may be performed in person or via synchronous  audio-visual \ntelemedicine in consultation with a consulting physician who has  personally examined \nthe individual.\n\nA three-generation pedigree must be completed, as appropriate.\nThe ordering physician must conduct a mandatory pretest and  commit to conducting post-\ntest follow-up counseling.\nTest results are expected to directly impact clinical  decision-making or clinical outcome \nfor the individual being tested.\nNo other causative circumstances (e.g., environmental  exposures, injury, prematurity, or \ninfection) can explain the individual’s  symptoms.\nA genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation  for the phenotype, based on \nmultiple congenital abnormalities affecting  unrelated organ systems or any two of the \nfollowing:\nAbnormality  affecting at minimum a single organ system\nProfound  global developmental delay, intellectual disability, symptoms of a complex \nneurodevelopmental disorder, or severe neuropsychiatric condition\nFamily  history strongly suggestive of a genetic etiology, including consanguinity\nPeriod  of unexplained developmental regression\nBiochemical  findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism where targeted \ntesting is  not available\nClinical presentation does not fit a well-described syndrome  for which single-gene or \ntargeted panel testing is available (e.g., comparative  genomic hybridization [CGH]\n/chromosomal microarray analysis [CMA]).\nWGS is more practical than the separate single gene tests or  panels that would be \nrecommended based on the differential diagnosis.\nWGS results may preclude the need for multiple or invasive  procedures, follow-up, or \nscreening that would be recommended in the absence of  testing.\nConditions that may be considered to qualify for WGS  include, but are not limited to, the \nfollowing:\nUnexplained or global developmental delay\nModerate, severe, or profound intellectual disability diagnosed  before 21 years of age\nEpileptic encephalopathy with onset before three years of age\nClinical history strongly suggests a genetic cause and two or  more of the following \nfeatures are present:\nCongenital anomaly\nSignificant hearing or visual impairment diagnosed before 21  years of age\nLaboratory abnormalities suggestive of an inborn error of  metabolism (IEM)\nAutism spectrum disorder or neuropsychiatric condition (e.g.,  bipolar disorder, \nschizophrenia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder)\nHypotonia or hypertonia in infancy\nDystonia, ataxia, hemiplegia, neuromuscular disorder, movement  disorder, or other \nneurologic abnormality\nUnexplained developmental regression, unrelated to autism or  epilepsy\nGrowth abnormality (e.g., failure to thrive, short stature,  microcephaly, \nmacrocephaly, or overgrowth)\nPersistent and severe immunologic or hematologic disorder\nDysmorphic features\nConsanguinity\nOther first- or second-degree family member(s) with similar  clinical features\nReevaluation (procedure code 81427) of a previously  obtained WGS sequence (procedure \ncode 81425) is considered medically necessary  when the above criteria for WGS and any of \nthe following conditions are met:\n\nOnset of additional symptoms that broadens the phenotype  assessed during the original \nexome/genome evaluation\nBirth or diagnosis of a similarly affected first-degree  relative* that has expanded the \nclinical picture\nNew scientific knowledge that suggests a previously unknown  link between the individual’\ns findings and specific genes/pathogenic or likely  pathogenic variants and that at least 18 \nmonths have passed since the last  analysis\nNote: *A first-degree relative is defined as a blood  relative with whom an individual shares \napproximately 50% of his/her genes,  including the individual’s parents, full siblings, and \nchildren.\nContact:\nMedicaidBenefitRequest@hhsc.state.tx.us  \nType: Informational\nTo: CHIP; STAR; STAR+PLUS; STARHEALTH; STAR_KIDS\nFrom: Policy", "prompt_cache_key": "qna-template-v1", "text": {"format": {"type": "json_object"}}}}

Seizure \ntypes include generalized seizures (absence seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic \nseizures), focal seizures (simple focal seizures, complex focal seizures, secondary \ngeneralized seizures, among others), and seizures for which the type is unknown. \nEpilepsy syndromes can be associated with generalized, focal, or combined \ngeneralized and focal seizures, and can have onset in childhood or adulthood.2 \nEpilepsy syndromes may be associated with developmental and/or epileptic \nencephalopathy (childhood onset) or progressive neurological deterioration (later \nonset).2 \nCause \nEpilepsy has multiple causes, including central nervous system infection, autoimmune \ndisease, structural brain abnormalities, brain tumors, and head trauma.3 There are also\nnumerous genetic conditions associated with epilepsy. It is estimated that \napproximately 40% of individuals with seizures have an underlying genetic basis for \ntheir condition (see Table 1 for a list of common genetic causes).4 Factors that \ncontribute to the likelihood of a genetic basis includes type of seizures (focal or \ngeneralized) or epilepsy syndromes (such as epileptic encephalopathy), age of onset, \nfamily history, and presence of other clinical features.\nThrough Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based testing, including multi-gene \npanels, whole exome and genome sequencing as well as whole-genome screening for \nCNVs, pathogenic sequence variants have been identified in about 30-40% and \ndeletions or duplications in ~5-10% of patients with a range of epilepsy phenotypes, \nincluding focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsies, epileptic encephalopathies, fever-\nassociated epilepsy syndromes, other epilepsy syndromes, and patients with \nneurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.5,6 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 11 of 20\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Epilepsy                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nThere are many different epilepsy syndromes, including generalized epilepsy \nsyndromes, focal epilepsy syndromes, combined generalized and focal epilepsy \nsyndromes, epilepsy syndromes with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy \n(DEE). These syndromes can present at variable ages ranging from neonatal to \nadulthood.2,7 \nDEE is a group of disorders in which seizures are accompanied by developmental \ndelays, cognitive impairment, or a host of other neurological issues such as feeding \ndifficulties, sleep dysregulation, and behavioral problems.8 Knowledge regarding the \ngenetic basis of these disorders has increased significantly in the last decade due to \nthe advent of high throughput NGS methods, resulting in wider availability of multi-gene\npanel testing. The following are examples of epileptic encephalopathies:\nOhtahara Syndrome (Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy)\no“Characterized by early onset intractable tonic spasms, suppression-burst \npattern on interictal EEG, and poor prognosis.”  9 \no“To date various genes, which have essential roles in the brain’s neuronal and \ninterneuronal functions, have been reported to be associated with Ohtahara \nsyndrome. For instance, syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) regulates synaptic\nvesicle release; aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) acts as a regulator of \nproliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors; solute carrier family 25 \nmember 22 (SLC25A22) encodes a mitochondrial glutamate transporter13; and \npotassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 2 (KCNQ2) plays\na key role in a cell’s ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.”  10 \nDravet Syndrome (Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy)\no“Clinical cardinal features include febrile or afebrile generalized or \nhemiconvulsions starting in the first year of life, seizure evolution to a mixture of \nintractable generalized (myoclonic or atonic seizures, atypical absences) and \nfocal seizures, normal early development, subsequent psychomotor retardation, \nand normal brain imaging at onset.”  9 \no“In most of the cases with Dravet syndrome, one single gene has been involved,\nin contrast to other epileptic encephalopathy syndromes. SCN1A mutations \nhave been shown in at least 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome.”  10 \nInfantile Spasms (West Syndrome and X-linked Infantile Spasms)\no“West syndrome is characterized by a specific seizure type, i.e., epileptic \nspasms, a unique interictal EEG pattern termed hypsarrhythmia, and \npsychomotor retardation. Spasms start within the first year of life, mainly \nbetween 4 and 6 months of age.”  9 \no“There are multiple genetic determinants of infantile spasms, which are usually \nexplained by mutations in distinct genes. Genetic analysis of children with \nunexplained infantile spasms have demonstrated mutations on the X \nchromosome in genes such as ARX, cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), \nand UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit (ALG13) as well as de novo \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Seizure, cognitive, and \npsychiatric phenotypes show heterogeneity. Seizures start from the age of 6 to \n36 months and may be precipitated by fever. Seizure types include GTCS, \nmyoclonic and tonic seizures, absences, and focal.”  9 \no“Different mutations of PCDH19 (protocadherin 19), including missense, \nnonsense, and frameshift mutations, have been reported as the cause of \nEFMR.” 9 \nInheritance \nInheritance patterns differ between various epilepsy syndromes, and include \nmonogenic inheritance patterns such as dominant, X-linked, recessive, and \nmitochondrial, in addition to epilepsy caused by de novo (i.e. new) genetic mutations. \nClinical heterogeneity is also seen in these conditions.\nDiagnosis \nAn electroencephalograph (EEG) can be used to help diagnose epilepsy and possibly \ngive information as to the seizure type. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \nscan can further help define whether epilepsy is caused by a structural brain \nabnormality or help determine the origin of epilepsy. \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is complicated by many factors. Epilepsy syndromes \nfrequently have overlapping features, such as the types of seizures involved and/or \nadditional clinical findings. Many (if not most) epilepsy syndromes, including epileptic \nencephalopathy, are genetically heterogeneous, and can be caused by mutations in a \nnumber of different genes. Sometimes, the inheritance pattern or the presence of \npathognomonic features makes the underlying syndrome clear. However, in many \ncases, it can be difficult to reliably diagnose a genetic epilepsy syndrome based on \nclinical and family history alone.\nNGS-based testing has been shown to dramatically improve the diagnostic rate for \nchildren and adults with epilepsy, as well as significantly shorten the time from \nassessment to diagnosis.11-13 The diagnostic yield of NGS in patients with epilepsy is \nestimated to be 20-40%.6,14,15 \nClinical information (e.g. age of onset, seizure type, EEG results, etc.) or family history \nmay be used in some cases to help narrow down the suspected cause.

Not all \ntreatments will work for everyone and often, it takes multiple treatment trials to find a \nregimen that is successful. Refractory epilepsy is diagnosed after two or more AEDs \nhave failed to control seizures. Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined as \"failure of \nadequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules \n(whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom\".16\nIn a rapidly growing number of epilepsy disorders, knowing the genetic mutation that is \nresponsible for the epilepsy has been shown to help guide management and provide \nmore disease-specific treatment.17,18 \nSurvival \nLifespan is dependent upon seizure control and the underlying cause of the individual's\nepilepsy.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nGenetic testing for epilepsy may consist of next-generation sequencing or multigene \npanels.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nMulti-Gene Testing Panels \nThe efficiency of NGS has led to an increasing number of large, multi-gene testing \npanels. NGS panels that test several genes at once are particularly well-suited to \nconditions caused by more than one gene or where there is considerable clinical \noverlap between conditions making it difficult to reliably narrow down likely causes. \nAdditionally, tests should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of identifying mutations \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

In this age period, the diagnostic yield of \ngenetic testing may reach up to 60%. However, age at testing (as opposed to the \nage at onset of epilepsy) should not influence the decision to test or the type of test \nchosen. Individuals who are now adults who had early-onset epilepsy likely \npresented in the era before genetic testing was widely available, and should be \nconsidered candidates for testing.\" \n\"Clinical utility of genetic testing is highest in the more severe, drug-resistant \nepilepsies . Overall, the most obvious indication, in terms of clinical utility and \ndiagnostic yield, is for people with early-onset DEE or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders with epilepsy.

Testing of individuals with drug-resistant non-\nacquired epilepsy without such comorbidities could be useful as identification of an \nunderlying genetic cause might lead to a more targeted treatment.\"\nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors practice guideline on epilepsy (2022), \nwhich was endorsed by the American Epilepsy Society (AES), stated:7\n\"We strongly recommend that individuals with unexplained epilepsy be offered \ngenetic testing, without limitation of age.\"\n\"We strongly recommend comprehensive, multi-gene testing, such as ES/GS \n[exome sequencing/genome sequencing] or MGP [multigene panels] as a first-tier \ntest. We conditionally recommend ES/GS over MGP as the first-tier test.\"\n\"The MGP panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and include copy number \nanalysis.\"\n\"MGPs are valuable clinical tools that can be employed in a number of clinical \nscenarios, for example, when an individual presents with a defined epilepsy \nsyndrome for which a subset of genes should be interrogated more robustly than \nthrough ES when GS is unavailable. Additionally, if urgent results are required and \nrapid ES/GS is unavailable, a targeted MGP may be considered. MGPs may also \nbe utilized as a first-tier test when access to ES/GS, or the additional genetic \ncounseling required to implement such testing, may be limited.\"\nSelected Relevant Publications \nPeer reviewed and expert authored articles are presented below. \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic testing for epileptic encephalopathy \nstated the following: \no“Second line investigations: Targeted next generation sequencing panels of \nepileptic encephalopathy genes for individuals with epileptic encephalopathy.”  8 \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic causes of early-onset epileptic \nencephalopathy stated the following:10 \no“Molecular-based studies on early-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be \nperformed, necessitating programmed genetical algorithms. If the phenotype \ncould be determined with clinical findings, specific gene testing would be helpful \nin diagnosis. However, if the phenotype could not be determined because of \noverlapping phenotypes of different syndromes and the spectrum of phenotypes\nseen in different mutations, the use of gene panels for epilepsy would increase \nthe probability of correct diagnosis. In a recent study, the rate of diagnosis with \ntargeted single gene sequencing has been reported as 15.4%, whereas the rate\nhas increased to 46.2% with the utility of epilepsy gene panels.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Benefit determinations are based in all cases on the applicable contract \nlanguage. To the extent there may be any conflict between the Medical Policy and contract language, the contract \nlanguage takes precedence.  \nPLEASE NOTE: Contracts exclude from coverage, among other things, services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers may bill members for services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers are e ncouraged to inform members before rendering such \nservices that the members are likely to be financially responsible for the cost of these services.  \n \nDESCRIPTION  \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is defined as targeted sequencing of the subset of the human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein- coding DNA.  Whole \ngenome sequencing (WGS) uses next -generation sequencing techniques to sequence both \ncoding- and non- coding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed to be \nmore efficient than traditional sequencing methods in discovering the genetic causes of diseases  and other indications . \nMEDICAL POLICY CRITERIA  \n \nNote:  This policy does not address tumor tissue or cell -free DNA testing for targeted \ntreatment of cancer (see Cross References  section ). \nI. Whole exome sequencing may be considered medically necessary for the evaluation \nof unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in pediatric patients (age 17 \nyears and younger) when all of the following criteria (A. – C.) are met:  \nA. The patient has had a clinical evaluation and has been informed about the \npotential risks of genetic testing; and \nB. There is clinical documentation that  whole exome sequencing results will guide \ndecisions for medical management; and \nC. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the patient’s \n\n\nGT76 | 2 phenotype, and one of the following is met:  \n1. The clinical presentation is not consistent with a well -described genetic \nsyndrome for which targeted genetic testing is available; or  \n2. Previous targeted genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis and whole \nexome sequencing may prevent the need for  invasive procedures as the next \ndiagnostic step (e.g. , muscle biopsy) .  \nII. Whole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic \ndisorders when Criterion I. is not met, including but not limited to prenatal or \npreimplantation testing.  \nIII. Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \nIV. Whole transcriptome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \n \nNOTE: A summary of the supporting rationale for the policy criteria is at the end of the policy.  \nLIST OF INFORMATION NEEDED FOR REVIEW  \nSUBMISSION OF GENETIC TESTING DOCUMENTATION \nAll of the following information must be submitted for review prior to the genetic testing:  \n• Name of genetic test(s)  and/or panel test   \n• Name of performing laboratory and/or genetic testing organization (more than one may \nbe listed)  \n• Date of blood draw or sample collection  \n• Relevant billing codes  \n• Brief description of how the genetic test results will guide clinical decisions that would \nnot otherwise be made in the absence of testing \n• Clinical d ocumentation that the risks of testing have been discussed \nCROSS REFERENCES  \n1.

It is being implemented for genetic testing \nmedical evidence review updates starting in 2017. According to this nomenclature, the term “variant” is used to describe a change in a DNA or protein sequence, repl acing previously \nused terms, such as “mutation.” Pathogenic variants are variants associated with disease, \nwhile benign variants are not. The majority of genetic changes have unknown effects on human health, and these are referred to as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) . \nCurrently available clinical assays designed for the molecular diagnosis of rare Mendelian diseases are incomplete. This is due to genetic heterogeneity, the presence of unknown \ncausative genes, and because only a portion of the known genes and variant s can be \nefficiently tested using conventional molecular methods. Recently, next -generation sequencing \n(NGS)  technologies have become more accessible in terms of cost and speed and have been \nadopted by a growing number of molecular genetic clinical laboratories.  \nDepending on the disorder and the degree of genetic and clinical heterogeneity, the current \ndiagnostic pathway for patients with suspected genetic disorders accompanied by multiple anomalies may depend on various combinations of low -yield radiographic, \nelectrophysiological, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic evaluations.\n[2] The search for a \ndiagnosis may thus become a time- consuming and expensive process. When a disease-\ncausing gene(s) is established, assays based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  technology, \nfor example, can be designed to specifically detect known variant s for clinical diagnosis. When \nmany different single -nucleotide variants (SNVs)  in a gene are possible, Sanger sequencing, \nthe current gold standard for detecting unknown SNVs , can be employed to determine the \nentire sequence of the coding and intron/exon splice sites of gene regions where variant s are \nmost likely to be found. However, when genes are large and variant s are possible in many or \nall exons (protein- coding regions of the gene), and when there is genetic (locus) heterogeneity, \ncomprehensive Sanger sequencing may be prohibitively laborious and costly.  \nWES using NGS technology is a relatively new approach to obtaining a genetic diagnosis in \npatients more efficiently compared with traditional methods. Exome sequencing has the capacity to determine an individual’s exomic variation profile in a single assay. This profile is \nlimited to most of the protein coding sequence of an individual (approximately 85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons, and constitutes approximately 1% of the whole genome. It is believed that the exome contains about 85% of heritable disease- causing \nvariant s. \nPublished studies have show n that exome sequencing can be used to detect previously \nannotated pathogenic variant s and reveal new likely pathogenic variant s in known and \nunknown genes. A limited number of studies have reported that the diagnostic yield of exome \nsequencing  appears to be significantly increased above that of traditional Sanger sequencing, \nwhile  also being faster and more efficien t relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.  \nWGS uses similar techniques to WES but involves the sequencing of noncoding DNA in addition to the protein- coding segments of the genome.  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing involves the use of NGS to sequence RNA molecules instead of DNA.  \nLIMITATIONS OF WES  AND WGS \n\nGT76 | 4 At this time, the limitations of WES  and WGS  include technical and implementation challenges. \nThere are issues of error rates due to uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture prior \nto sequencing, and difficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without losing likely candidate variant s. It is difficult to filter and interpret \npotential causative variants from the large number of variants of unknown significance (VUS)  \ngenerated for each patient. Variant databases are poorly annotated, and algorithms for annotating variants will need to be automated. Existing databases that catalog variants and putative disease associations are known to have significant entry error rates.  \nApproaches for characterizing the functional impact of rare and novel variants (i.e., achieving full-genome clinical interpretations that are scientifically sound and medically relevant) have to \nbe improved. The variability contributed by the different platforms and procedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service is unknown, and detailed guidance from regulatory and professional organizations is still under development. Finally, exome sequencing has some similar limitations as Sanger sequencing and will not \nidentify the following: intronic sequences or gene regulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions, duplications or rearrangements within genes; nucleotide repeats; or epigenetic changes. WGS address some of these limitations but is limited by the need for increased analytic power and the likelihood of greater identification of VUS. \nThere are also ethical questions about reporting incidental findings such as identifying \nmedically relevant variant s in genes unrelated to the diagnostic question, sex chromosome \nabnormalities, and non- paternity when family studies are performed. Standards for the \nrequired components of informed consent before WES/WGS is performed have been proposed and include a description of confidentiality and a description of how incidental findings will be managed.\n[3] Methods of reporting findings from WES/WGS are in development. \nFor example, McLaughlin et al, reporting on the MedSeq Project which is testing methods for evaluating and reporting WES/WGS data, described the development of a genome report that highlights results  that are significant to the indication being evaluated.\n[4] \nRESULTS OF TESTING WITH WES/WGS[5] \n1. A variant known to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• This is a sequence variant that has been shown through prior genetic and clinical research to cause a disease.  \n2. A variant suspected to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• Most variants detected by WES sequencing are uncharacterized and some are \nnovel (i.e., never known to have been observed in a human sample). Some variants \nallow for relatively easy and accurate clinical interpretation; however, for most there is little dat a on which to base an assessment of causality. Tools to facilitate the \nassessment of causality include bioinformatic analyses, predicted structural changes, and others. While these tools may be useful, their predictive power is highly variable. In addition, each clinical laboratory offering WES/WGS testing have their own “in- house” algorithm to facilitate assessment and classification of these \nvariants.  \n\nGT76 | 5 3. A variant of uncertain significance (VOUS/VUS)  is identified.   \n• Among the known 30,000 to 40,000 variants that reside in the protein- coding \nportions of the genome, the typical subject will have three to eight  actionable \nvariants. (Most relate to reproductive risks, i .e., heterozygous carrier alleles.) But the \nremaining thousands are either highly likely to be benign or of uncertain clinical \nsignificance. It can be equally as challenging to prove that a variant is benign as it is to prove it is pathogenic. Currently, nearly all variants among the tens of thousands must b e considered of uncertain significance.   \nAVAILABLE TESTING SERVICES  \nWES  \nExamples of some laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service and their \nindications for testing are summarized in the table below.  \nLaboratory  Laboratory indications for testing \nAmbry Genetics  “The patient's clinical presentation is unclear/atypical disease and there are \nmultiple genetic conditions in the differential diagnosis.”  \nGeneDx  “a patient with a diagnosis that suggests the involvement of one or more of many different genes, which would, if even available and sequenced individually, be prohibitively expensive”  \nBaylor College of Medicine “used when a patient’s medical history and physical exam findings strongly \nsuggest that there is an underlying genetic etiology. In some cases, the \npatient may have had an extensive evaluation consisting of multiple genetic tests, without identifying an etiology.” Baylor also offers a prenatal WES \ntest. \nUniversity of California Los Angeles Health System  “This test is intended for use in conjunction with the clinical presentation and other markers of disease progression for the management of patients with rare genetic disorders.”  \nEdgeBio Recommended “In situations where there has been a diagnostic failure with no discernible path . . . In situations where there are currently no available \ntests to determine the status of a potential genetic disease . . . In situations \nwith atypical findings  indicative of multiple disease[s]”  \nChildren’s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics  Provided as a service to families with children who have had an extensive negative work -up for a genetic disease; also used to identify novel disease \ngenes.  \nEmory Genetics Laboratory  “Indicated when there is a suspicion of a genetic etiology contributing to the proband’s manifestations.”  \nKnight Diagnostic Laboratory  “diagnosing rare hereditary diseases, inconclusive results from targeted panel tests, presentation of multiple phenotypes or when a patient presents an unknown or novel phenotype.”  \nWGS  \nAlthough WGS has been used as a research tool, it is less well -developed as a clinical service. \nSeveral laboratories offer WGS as a clinical service. \n\nGT76 | 6 Transcriptome Sequencing  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing is primarily used as a research tool, but several labs now \noffer such testing for clinical purposes.  \nREGULATORY STATUS  \nNo U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -cleared genotyping tests were found. Thus, \ngenotyping is offered as a laboratory -developed test. Clinical laboratories may develop and \nvalidate tests in- house (“home- brew”) and market them as a laboratory service.  Such tests \nmust meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). \nThe laboratory offering the service must be licensed by CLIA for high- complexity testing.  \nEVIDENCE SUMMARY  \nValidation of the clinical use of any genetic test focuses on three main principles:  \n1. The analytic validity of the test, which refers to the technical accuracy of the test in detecting a variant  that is present or in excluding a variant  that is absent;  \n2. The clinical validity of the test, which refers to the diagnostic performance of the test (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) in detecting clinical disease; and  \n3. The clinical utility of the test, i.e., how the results of the diagnostic test will be used to change management of the patient and whether these changes in management lead to clinically important improvements in health outcomes.  \nThe focus of the literature search was on evidence related to the ability of genetic test results to: \n• Guide decisions in the clinical setting related to either treatment, management, or prevention, and  \n• Improve health outcomes as a result of those decisions.  \nWHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING (WES)  \nThe clinical validity  of WES is related to the diagnostic performance of this technology, while \nthe clinical utility lies in the influence of the results on medical decision making and patient outcomes. For  clinical utility to be established, evidence would be needed of the ability of WES \nto provide the following improvements over other testing methods:  \n• Ability to establish a definitive diagnosis by detection of additional variant s not found by \nother testing methods and leading to management changes that improve outcomes and/or eliminate the need for additional testing   \n• Equivalent or superior accuracy attained with superior efficiency of workup (e.g., diagnosis obtained more quickly) compared with other methods of sequencing.  \nTechnology Assessments \nA 2013 BlueCross BlueShield Association Technology Evaluation Center (TEC) Special Report \non WES in patients with suspected genetic disorders, found no published studies that systematically examined potential outcomes of interest such as changes in medical  \nmanagement (including revision of initial diagnoses), and changes in reproductive decision \n\nGT76 | 7 making after a diagnosis of a Mendelian disorder by WES.[6] The evidence was limited to a \nsmall number of studies of patient series and a larger number of very small series or family \nstudies that reported anecdotal examples of medical management and reproductive decision-making outcomes of exome sequencing in patients who were not diagnosed by traditional methods. These studies showed that, over and above traditional molecular and conventional diagnostic testing, exome sequencing could lead to a diagnosis that influenced patient care and/or reproductive decisions but gave no indication of the proportion of patients for which this was true. The report noted that publication of a large number of small diagnostic studies with positive results but few with negative results raise the possibility of publication bias, the impact of which is unknown.  \nIn 2020, the Washington State Health Care Authority released a technology assessment of \nWES.\n[7] Information on the diagnostic yield of WES was calculated using data from 99 studies. \nThe overall pooled estimate for this was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.7% to 40.6%), \nwhile the pooled yield for gene panels and traditional testing pathways were 27% (95% CI 13.7% to 40.5%) and 21% (95% CI 5.6% to 36.4%), respectively.  The diagnostic yield \ngenerally decreased with increasing patient age. The clinical utility of WES was assessed based on data from 30 studies, most of which were single- arm observational cohort studies. \nThe key findings from this assessment were:  \n• “Among studies that enrolled patients with diverse phenotypes (18 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 12% to 100%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 5% to 25%  \no A WES diagnosis resulted in counseling and genetic testing for family members for between 4% and 97%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with epilepsy (5 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 0% to 31%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 0% to 20%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with a single phenotype (7 studies), all reported some changes in clinical management following a WES diagnosis, but the data was too heterogenous to synthesize into a single range.”  \nThe certainty of the evidence related to clinical utility was rated as very low due to study limitations including study design, inconsistency, and imprecision. Evidence related to health outcomes could not be evaluated due to the substantial limitations in study design and outcome reporting among the seven studies that reported these outcomes.  \nWES f\nor Children with Multiple Congenital Anomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of \nUnknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nSince the publication of the 2013 TEC Special Report, several studies have been published that address the use of either WES (see Table 1)  in clinical practice. Typically, the populations \nincluded in these studies have had suspected rare genetic disorders, although the specific populations vary.  Smith (2019 ) reported a scoping review of genome and exome sequencing \nas a diagnostic tool for pediatric patients.\n[8] The authors identified 171 publications, although \n131 were case reports. They concluded that diagnostic yield was the only consistently reported outcome. The median diagnostic yield in publications including more than single case reports was 33% but varied by broad clinical categories and test type.  \nSeries have been reported with as many as 2, 000 patients. The most common reason for \nreferral to a tertiary care center was an unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder. Many \n\nGT76 | 8 patients had been through standard clinical workup and testing without identification of a \ngenetic variant to explain their condition. Diagnostic yield in these studies, defined as the proportion of tested patients with clinically relevant genomic abnormalities, ranged from 25% to 48%. Because there is no reference standard for the diagnosis of patients who have exhausted alternative testing strategies, clinical confirmation may be the only method for determining false- positive and false- negative rates. No reports were identified of incorrect \ndiagnoses, and how often they might occur is unclear. When used as a first -line test in infants \nwith multiple congenital abnormalities and dysmorphic features, diagnostic yield may be as high as 58%. Testing parent -child trios has been reported to increase diagnostic yield, to \nidentify an inherited variant from an unaffected parent and be considered benign, or to identify a de novo variant not present in an unaffected parent. First -line trio testing for children with \ncomplex  neurologic disorders was shown to increase the diagnostic yield (29%, plus a possible \ndiagnostic finding in 27%) compared with a standard clinical pathway (7%) performed in parallel in the same patients .\n[9] \nTable 1.

These series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 22% to 58%, depending on the individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. Comparative studies have reported an increase in diagnostic yield compared with standard testing strategies. Thus, for individuals who have a suspected genetic etiology but for whom the specific genetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. A genetic diagnosis for these patients is reported to change management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. \nWES for Children with a Suspected Genetic Disorder Other Than Multiple Congenital \nAnomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of Unknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nMost of the literature on WES is on neurodevelopmental disorders in children; however, other \npotential indications for WES have been reported (see Table 2 ). These include limb- girdle \nmuscular dystrophy, inherited retinal disease, and other disorders including mitochondrial, endocrine, and immunologic disorders.  \nTable 2.

VUS: variant of uncertain significance  \nSection Summary  \nThere is an increasing number of reports assessing use of WES identify a molecular basis for \ndisorders other than multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies ranged from 3% for colorectal cancer to 60% for trio (parents and child) analysis of limb- girdle muscular dystrophy. Some studies have reported on the use \nof a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease- associated genes, and the authors \nnoted that WES data allows reanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder, and study of WES in these disorders is at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  \nWHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING (WGS)  \nA 2020 Health Technology Assessment conducted by Ontario Health, with literature searches conducted in January 2019, included a comparative review of the diagnostic yield of WES and WGS in children with unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies.\n[47] The diagnostic yield across all studies was 37% (95% CI 34% to 40%). More \nstudies, with an overall larger sample size, were included in the examination on WES (34 \n\nGT76 | 15 studies, n=9,142) than on whole genome sequencing (nine studies, n=648). Confidence \nintervals for studies using WES versus WGS overlapped (37%, 95% CI 34% to 40% vs. 40%, \n95% CI 32% to 49%). Diagnostic yield ranged between 16% and 73%, with variation attributed largely to technology used and participant selection. The overall quality of the evidence was \nrated as very low, downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision.  \nThis body of evidence suggests that the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup. However, it is not possible to determine from these studies the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis following WES.  \nIn some studies of WGS, the genes examined were those previously associated with the phenotype, while other studies were research -based and conducted more exploratory analysis. \nIt has been noted that genomes sequenced with WGS are available for future review when new variants associated with clinical diseases are discovered.\n[48] Studies have shown that \nWGS can detect more pathogenic variants than WES, due to an improvement in detecting copy number variants, insertions and deletions, intronic single nucleotide variants, and exonic single nucleotide variants in regions with poor coverage on WES. Most studies of  WGS \nindicated that only pathogenic or likely -pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic \nyield and that variants of uncertain significance were not reported (see Table 3). Five studies included in the Ontario HTA review provided data on the yield of VUS, with an overall yield of 17%. Only one of the five  studies used WGS, however. The review authors noted, \"Whole \ngenome sequencing always results in substantially longer lists of variants of unknown significance than whole exome sequencing does. Interpreting and acting upon variants of unknown clinical significance is the single greatest challenge identified by clinicians….”\n[47] \nThe use of WGS and rapid WGS has been studied in critically ill children in several observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, two  randomized controlled trial s \n(RCTs), and one systematic review. Studies are described in Table 6. The systematic review \nand RCTs are discussed in more detail in the following systematic review and r andomized \ncontrolled trials sections. One study included only infants with cardiac defects and had a \ndiagnostic yield of 6% with WGS. The remaining studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60%.  \nTable 3.

Three RCTs were included. The mean age of study participants was two days to 18 years. The quality of evidence was rated as \n\nGT76 | 21 high for the included RCTs and moderate for the observational studies.  The meta- analysis \nrevealed a statistically significantly higher  pooled diagnostic yield for WGS, 38.6% (95% CI  \n32.6 to 45.0) , compared to WES, 37.8% (95% CI  32.9 to 42.9) , and usual care, 7.8% (95% CI  \n4.4 to 13.2) . The review authors concluded that although whole genome sequencing for the \npediatric population with suspected genetic disorders provided an accurate and early genetic \ndiagnosis in a high proportion of cases, further research is needed to evaluate costs, effectiveness, and cost -effectiveness of WGS.  \nRandomized Controlled Trials  \nKingsmore (2019) reported early results of a randomized trial comparing rapid WGS (rWGS) to \nrapid WES (rWES) for seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology at a single center  \n(NSIGHT2 trial ).\n[35] Of the 578 eligible infants, 213 were enrolled in the study, 24 of whom were \nvery ill and received ultra- rapid WGS (ultra -rWGS) without randomization. Ninety -four of the \nremaining 189 infants were randomized to receive rWGS and 95 to receive rWES. The diagnostic yield of ultra -rWGS for the 24 very ill infants was 11 (46%)  and the median time to \nresult was 4.6 days. The diagnostic  yields were very similar for both randomized groups  (18/94 \n[19%] for rWGS and 19/95 [20%] for rWES), as were the times to results, which were 11.0 and \n11.2 days for rWGS and rWES, respectively.  Dimmock (2020)  reported results of the primary \nendpoint of NSIGHT2: clinician perception that rWGS was useful and clinic ian-reported \nchanges in management.\n[51] Clinicians provided perceptions of the clinical utility of diagnostic \ngenomic sequencing for 201 of 213 infants randomized (94%). In 154 (77%) infants, diagnostic genomic sequencing was perceived to be useful or very useful; perceptions of usefulness did not differ between infants who received rWES and rWGS, nor between ultra- rWGS and \nrWES/rWGS. Thirty -two (15%) of 207 clinician responses indicated that diagnostic genomic \nsequencing changed infant outcomes (by targeted treatments in 21 infants, avoidance of complications in 16, and institution of palliative care in two  infants). Changes in outcome did \nnot differ significantly between infants randomized to rWES and rWGS, although ultra- rWGS \nwas associated with a significantly  higher rate of change in manag ement than rWES/rWGS \n(63% vs. 23% , p=0.0001).  \nPetrikin (2018) reported on the INSIGHT1 RCT of rWGS  to diagnose suspected genetic \ndisorders in critically ill infants.\n[58] INSIGHT1 was an investigator -initiated (funded by National \nHuman Genome Research Institute [NHGRI] and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD]), blinded, pragmatic trial comparing trio rWGS with standard genetic tests to standard genetic tests alone with a primary outcome of proportion of NICU/PICU infants receiving a genetic diagnosis within 28 days. Parents of patients and clinicians were unblinded after 10 days and compassionate cross -over to rWGS \noccurred in five  control patients. The study was designed to enroll 500 patients in each group \nbut was terminated early due to loss of equipoise on the part of study clinicians who began to regard standard tests alone as inferior to standard tests plus trio rWGS. Intention- to-treat \nanalyses were reported, i.e., crossovers were included in the group to which they were randomized. The trial required confirmatory testing of WGS results which lengthened the time to rWGS diagnosis by 7 to 10 days. Molecular diagnosis was achieved in 31% of the rWGS \ngroup, compared with 3% in the standard testing group (p=0.003). The time to diagnosis was also significantly shorter in the rWGS group (13 days vs. 107 days, p=0.002).  \nIn the NICUSeq RCT, Krantz (2021) compared rWGS (test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease at five  sites in the US.\n[50] In 76% of cases, both \n\nGT76 | 22 parents were available for trio testing. Overall, 82 of 354 infants received a diagnosis (23%), \nwith a higher yield in the 15- day group. The primary outcome was change in management, \nmeasured at day 60. Significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs 10.3% , p=0.009, odds ratio 2.3, 95% \nCI 1.22 to 4.32). Changes in management included subspecialty referral (21 of 354, 6.0%), changes to medication (5 of 354, 1.4%), therapeutics specific to the primary genetic etiology (7 of 354, 2.0%) and surgical interventions (12 of 354, 3.4%). Survival and length of stay did not \ndiffer between the groups.  \nSection Summary \nWGS has been studied in critically ill and non- critically ill children with congenital abnormalities \nand development delays of unknown etiology following standard workup.  The diagnostic yield \nfor WGS has been reported between 20% and 40%. Additional indirect evidence is available from studies reporting diagnostic yield and change in management results of WES in a similar population, and it is reasonable to expect that WGS is likely to result in similar or better diagnostic yield for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and similar changes in management as compared with WES. WGS has also been studied in children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup. The diagnostic yield of WGS has been between 9% and 55%.  However, these studies include mixed indications with heterogenous populations and include little information about associated changes in management following genetic diagnosis . \nWES/WGS FOR OTHER INDICATIONS \nWES/WGS for Preimplantation  \nPeters (2015) reported on the results of WGS performed on three 5- to 10- cell biopsies from \ntwo blastocyst -stage embryos in order to detect single base de novo variants and small \ninsertions and deletions.\n[73] Both parents and paternal grandparents were also analyzed in \norder to measure false- positive and false- negative error rates. Overall, great than 95% of each \ngenome was called. Experimentally derived haplotypes were used to detect up to 82% of de \nnovo SNVs with a false -positive rate of about one error per gigabase, resulting in fewer than \n10 errors per embryo. The authors state that this represents an approximately 100- fold lower \nerror rate than previously published from 10- cell embryos, and it is the first  demonstration that \nWGS can be used to accurately identify de novo variants in spite of the thousands of false-positive errors introduced by the extensive DNA amplification required for deep sequencing.  \nWES/WGS for Pre natal Fetal Testing \nGirolamo (2023) published a systematic review and meta- analysis to estimate the incremental \nyield of detecting pathogenic or likely pathogenic diagnostic genetic variants (DGV) by whole exome sequencing (WES) over standard karyotype and chromosomal microarray (CMA) analyses in fetuses with isolated increased nuchal translucency (NT) and normal fetal anatomy at the time of 11- 14 weeks scan.\n[74] The secondary outcomes were the detection of a genetic \nvariant of unknown significance. Sub- analysis according to different NT cutoffs (between 3.0 \nand 5.5 mm and > 5.5 mm) and considering fetuses with isolated NT in which fetal anatomy was confirmed to be normal at the anomaly scan were also performed.  Eight articles (324 \nfetuses) were included in the systematic review. Of the fetuses with negative standard karyotype and CMA analysis, the 8.07% (95% CI 5.4 to 11.3) had pathogenic or likely \n\nGT76 | 23 pathogenic genetic variants detected exclusively by WES. When stratifying the analysis \naccording to NT cutoffs, genetic anomalies detected exclusively at WES analysis were found in 44.70% (95% CI 26.8 to 63.4) of fetuses with NT between 3.0 mm and 5.5 mm and 55.3% \n(95% CI 36.6 to 73.2) in those fetuses with NT >5.5 mm and positive WES results. The 7.84% \n(95% CI 1.6 to18.2) had variants of unknown significance identified by WES.  Pathogenic and \nlikely pathogenic genetic variants detected by WES are present in a significant proportion of \nfetuses with increased NT but normal standard karyotype and CMA analysis, also when no anomalies are detected at the anomaly scan. Further large studies sharing objective protocols of imaging assessment are needed to confirm these findings . \nMellis (2022) published a systematic review and meta- analysis of WES for prenatal diagnosis \nof fetal structural anomalies, which included data from 66 studies  and 4, 350 fetuses  that had \nnormal karyotype or CMA testing.\n[75] The incremental diagnostic yield of WES in this setting \nwas reported to be 31% (95% CI 26% to 36% ) and was higher in cases that were pre- selected \nas likely having monogenic disorders (42% vs. 15%). By phenotype, the yield was also higher in cases with skeletal abnormalities (53%) and lowest in cases with isolated increased nuchal translucency (2%).  \nWES/WGS for Pregnancy Loss  \nQiao (2016) evaluated the use of WES to identify genetic causes of idiopathic recurrent early pregnancy loss (RPL), assessing seven euploid miscarriages from four families with RPL.\n[76] \nThe study identified compound heterozygous pathogenic variants of DYNC2H1  and ALOX15  in \ntwo out of four families with RPL. Although the authors concluded that CNVs, individual SNVs and pool of deleterious gene variants identified by exome sequencing could contribute to RPL, they acknowledge that the study has limitations, mainly the small  sample cohort is small and \nthat functional analysis of the candidate variants must be evaluated to determine whether the variants are causative.  \nWHOLE TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING  \nTranscriptome sequencing has been used mainly as a research tool to identify potential \nmarkers for understanding disease pathologies or identifying markers for disease detection. \nLimited clinical studies of transcriptome sequencing have been published. For  example, a \nstudy by Walter (2021) compared whole transcriptome sequencing to WGS in 279 patients \nwith acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; B-cell n=211, T- cell n = 68) .[77] Transcriptome \nsequencing was able to distinguish between B -cell ALL and T- cell ALL based on the \nexpression of 14 markers, and it was used to identify  a number of gene fusions.   \nPRACTICE GUIDELINE SUMMARY \nAMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL GENETICS \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical \npractice guideline for the use of WES and WGS in pediatric patients and made the following recommendation: \"We strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second- tier test \n(guided by clinical judgment and often clinician- patient/family shared decision making after \nCMA or focused testing) for patients with one or more [congenital anomalies]  prior to one year \nof age or for patients with [developmental delay/intellec tual disability]  with onset prior to 18 \nyears of age.\"\n[78] The recommendation was informed by a systematic evidence review and a \nhealth technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.  \n\nGT76 | 24 In 2015, ACMG published a policy statement updating their 2013 their recommendation s for \nanalysis and reporting of secondary/ incidental findings in whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing .[79, 80] \n• The panel states that patients must be made aware, it the time of consent, that \nlaboratories routinely analyze the sequence of a set of genes deemed to be highly medically actionable so as to detect pathogenic variants that may predispose to a severe but preventable disease. \n• Although patients have the choice to opt out of receiving these results, that they should be made aware of the ramifications of doing so.  \nDue to the inherent difficulty of counseling patients about the features of each disorder and every gene deemed actionable by the ACMG, analysis and reporting of secondary findings should apply to the entire list of medically actionable genes, and not a subset.  \nSUMMARY  \nThere is enough research to show that whole exome sequencing (WES) can increase diagnosis rates and improve health outcomes for certain children who are suspected of having a genetic disorder. In some situations, WES testing may prevent the need for more invasive diagnostic tests, such as muscle biopsy. Therefore, WES may be considered \nmedically necessary when policy criteria are met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole exome sequencing (WES) improves health outcomes for patients who do not meet the policy criteria, including adults and individuals with signs and symptoms consistent with a well -known disorder that can be \nidentified by targeted testing. Therefore, WES is considered investigational when policy criteria are not met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) can \nbe used to improve patient health outcomes.  In addition, there are technical limitations such \nas the lack of standardized laboratory procedures, gaps in interpreting ancillary information, and the detection of variants of uncertain significance. Therefore, the use of WGS  is \nconsidered investigational for all indications.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole transcriptome sequencing can be used to improve patient health outcomes.  This technology has been primarily used in the \nresearch setting and there is little evidence regarding its clinical use.  Therefore, whole \ntranscriptome sequencing is considered investigational for all indications.  \nREFERENCES  \n 1. den Dunnen JT, Dalgleish R, Maglott DR, et al.

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered. In particular, a patient who had negative germline BRCA1 and 2\ntesting, who is from a family with no pathogenic variants, should be considered for \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results. It is also reasonable to order a multi-gene panel if \nthe family history is incomplete (i.e., a case of adoption, patient is uncertain of exact\ntype of cancer affecting family members, among others) or other cancers are found \nin the family history, as described above.\" \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology and Society of Surgical Oncology \nA 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Society of Surgical \nOncology (SSO) joint guideline for germline testing in individuals with breast cancer \nstated the following:13\n\"All patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer with stage I-III or de novo stage \nIV/metastatic disease who are 65 years or younger at diagnosis should be offered \nBRCA1/2 testing\"\n\"All patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer with stage I-III or de novo stage \nIV/metastatic disease who are older than age 65 should be offered BRCA1/2 testing\nif:\nothey are candidates for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy \nfor early-stage or metastatic disease,\nothey have triple-negative breast cancer,\notheir personal or family history suggests the possibility of a pathogenic variant, \nothey were assigned male sex at birth, \nothey are of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry or are members of a population with an \nincreased prevalence of founder mutations\"\n\"BRCA1/2 testing should be offered to patients with a second primary cancer either \nin the contralateral or ipsilateral breast\"\nAmerican Urological Association and American Society for Radiation Oncology \nA 2022 American Urological Association (AUA) and American Society for Radiation \nOncology (ASTRO) joint guideline for clinically localized prostate cancer stated the \nfollowing:14\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The USPSTF guideline recommended:10\nWhen a woman's personal or family history of cancer is consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family \nhistory of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry \nassociated with breast cancer susceptibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) gene mutations with\nan appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history.

Therefore, it often is not necessary to do chromosome analysis or FISH in \nconjunction with microarray. Microarray requests following such testing will require \nreview. \n†Multiple congenital anomalies  defined as 1) two or more major anomalies affecting \ndifferent organ systems or 2) one major and two or more minor anomalies affecting \ndifferent organ systems. Major structural abnormalities  are generally serious enough\nas to require medical treatment on their own (such as surgery) and are not minor \ndevelopmental variations that may or may not suggest an underlying disorder. \nChromosomal Microarray (CMA) Exclusions and Considerations \nIf routine karyotype and CMA are ordered simultaneously, only the most appropriate \ntest based on clinical history will be considered for coverage. If CMA has been \nperformed, the following tests are often excessive and thus not considered medically \nnecessary. Each test may require medical necessity review.\nRoutine karyotype: Full karyotype in addition to CMA is typically considered \nexcessive. However, a limited 5 cell analysis may be approved in addition to CMA if \ncriteria for CMA are met. This approval may be subject to claims review to ensure \nthat the appropriate procedure code for a limited 5 cell analysis is billed (CPT \n88261 x1, 88230 x1, 88291 x1).\nFISH Analysis \nTelomere Analysis\nMore than one type of microarray analysis (i.e. if 81228 performed, 81229 is not \nmedically necessary) \nCMA is not considered medically necessary in cases of family history of \nchromosome rearrangement in phenotypically normal individuals.\nCMA is not considered medically necessary in individuals experiencing infertility, \nstructurally normal pregnancy losses that occur at less than 20 weeks, or recurrent \npregnancy loss. \nWhen a multigene deletion/duplication panel is being requested and billed using a \nmicroarray procedure code (typically 81228 or 81229), please refer to the Genetic \nTesting by Multigene Panels  clinical use guideline; do not apply the criteria in this \nguideline. \nCMA for delineation of deletion, duplication, or translocation breakpoints will be \nreviewed on a case by case basis.\nCMA for determination of whether a translocation is balanced or unbalanced with be\nreviewed on a case by case basis.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When present, the following developmental disorders often \nprompt an evaluation for copy number variants: intellectual disability (ID), global \ndevelopmental delay (GDD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and congenital \nanomalies.\nCopy Number Variants (CNVs) \nCopy number variants (CNVs) are deletions and duplications of genetic material. CNVs\naccount for a significant proportion of congenital anomalies and developmental \ndisorders without a clear etiology based on clinical findings. CNVs are detected using \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

CMA is known by several names including \narray-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and single-nucleotide polymorphism \narrays (SNP-array).\nIncidence \nID and congenital anomalies affect approximately 3-4% of the general population.1 The\nincidence of GDD is comparable to ID. ASD, which now includes autistic disorder, \npervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger \nsyndrome, are also of increasing concern, with recent CDC incidence figures \nestimating 1 in 36 affected children.2 \nHeart defects are the most common congenital anomaly, affecting nearly 1-1.2% of live\nbirths.3 Sixty to eighty percent of major structural anomalies are identified prenatally by \nultrasound evaluation.4 \nCause \nThe etiology of developmental disorders and congenital anomalies is complex. Some \ndevelopmental problems may be caused by non-genetic factors, such as injury, birth \ncomplications, endocrine disorders, toxic exposures, and infection. However, genetic \ncauses also play a significant role.5-8 \nA clinical genetics evaluation can identify a cause in a portion of individuals with ID, \nGDD, or ASD. Identifying an underlying genetic cause in these individuals may:5-8\nProvide diagnostic and prognostic information \nImprove health screening and prevention for some conditions \nAllow for testing of family members and accurate recurrence risk counseling, and\nEmpower the individual and family to acquire needed services and support\nCMA on chorionic villi or amniocytes is indicated in any pregnancy in which diagnostic \ntesting for chromosome abnormalities and CNVs is desired.9-11 Identifying an \nunderlying genetic cause in these individuals may:6\nProvide diagnostic and prognostic information\nGuide prenatal management and decision-making, and\nAllow for testing of family members and accurate recurrence risk counseling.\nParental Testing \nIf a CNV is detected in a child, it may be helpful to test both parents to determine \nwhether the CNV is inherited or a new (de novo) genetic change. This information \nalong with parental findings can be used to weigh the possibilities of a benign vs. \npathogenic variant. However, even with parental studies, the clinical outcome may \nremain unclear.1,9 A de novo variant is more likely to represent a pathologic \nabnormality.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Evaluation of\nthe inheritance pattern, including whether the CNV is inherited or a new (de novo) \ngenetic change, factors into this scoring system.\nTest information \nIntroduction\nTesting for developmental disorders in the prenatal and postnatal setting may include \nCMA testing.\nChromosomal Microarray \nCMA testing generally works by fluorescently tagging DNA from an individual’s test \nsample with one color and combining it with a control sample tagged in a different \ncolor. The two samples are mixed and then added to the array chip, where they \ncompete to hybridize with the DNA fragments on the chip. By comparing the test \nsample versus the control, computer analysis can determine where genetic material \nhas been deleted or duplicated in the individual.\nThere are a growing number of CMA testing platforms, including non-chip based \napplications, which differ in approach and resolution. Clinical laboratories may not only \ndiffer in the arrays that they utilize but also in their reporting practices. Although testing \nguidelines do not endorse one CMA over another, it is typically advisable that coverage\nof an ordered CMA is better than that offered by a standard karyotype and that the \nminimum resolution of the CMA provided by the laboratory is adequate. The inclusion \nof analysis of subtelomeric regions and known microdeletion syndromes with CMA \ntesting obviates the need for additional FISH analysis.\nCMA testing offers advantages over conventional karyotyping with regard to resolution \nand yield. However, there are some limitations of CMA testing including:\nthe inability to detect\nobalanced chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations or inversions\nocertain forms of polyploidy\nosex chromosome aneuploidy dependent on the gender control used\nolow level mosaicism\nosome marker chromosomes\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

In addition, 1.7% of prenatal cases with \nan indication of advanced maternal age or positive screening results and normal \nkaryotype had a clinically relevant deletion or duplication identified by CMA.10 \nIn a large series of fetuses with ultrasound anomalies and normal conventional \nkaryotype, CMA detected chromosome abnormalities in 5% of fetuses and up to \n10% in those with 3 or more anatomic abnormalities.14 \nA cohort study utilizing amniocentesis samples reported karyotype detected \nabnormalities in 5.41% of fetuses and CMA detected abnormalities in 9.14% of \nfetuses. The detection rate of CMA combined with karyotype was 0.35% higher \nthan CMA alone and 4.08% higher than karyotype alone.15 \nA retrospective study of 523 prenatal (amniocentesis) and 319 products-of-\nconception cases with a wide variety of referral indications demonstrated a \ndiagnostic yield of clinically significant CMA findings in 7.8% and 16.3% of cases, \nrespectively.16 \nAnother study showed an approximate 55% diagnostic yield when performing CMA \nin first trimester losses.17,18 \nCMA had a diagnostic yield of \"41.9% in all stillbirths, 34.5% in antepartum \nstillbirths, and 53.8% in stillbirths with anomalies.\"19,20 \nA meta-analysis of fetuses with congenital heart disease (CHD) found a pooled \nproportion of overall chromosomal abnormalities, aneuploidy, 22q11.2 deletion, and \nother CNVs was 23%, 19%, 2%, and 4%, respectively.21 In a later study of fetuses \nwith severe CHD and absence of aneuploidy, a CNV was identified in 9.9% of \ncases.22 \nCMA may also be useful in the workup of non-immune fetal hydrops and fetal \nventriculomegaly.23-25 \nSome forms of mosaic aneuploidy will only be detected by a cultured sample, as \ntypically required for karyotype and would not be observed using CMA on a direct \nsample.26 \nThe diagnostic yield for CMA across various postnatal clinical settings is presented \nbelow.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

In the brain, the FMR1 gene is responsible for producing a protein essential for development of \nconnections of the nerve cells . Alterations , or mutations, in the genetic material of the FMR1 gene can \nresult in disorders such as Fragile X syndrome, premature ovarian insufficiency, and the neurologic \ndisease Fragile X -associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS).  FXTAS  primarily affects men over the \nage of 50 and is associ ated with signs and symptoms including tremor, ataxia, and dementia.  \n \nFragile X syndrome is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and the most common \ncause of autism linked to a single gene. Associated with physical, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities, \nFragile X syndrome has an X -linked dominant inheritance pattern. Female offspring inherit an X \nchromosome from each parent, whereas male offspring always inherit the X chromosome from their \nmother and the Y chromosome from their father. This means that the FMR1 gene is inherited by females \nfrom their mother or father and  by males from their mother only. Prevalence and symptoms of Fragile X \nsyndrome in females are often milder than in males because with two X chromosomes, one X \nchromosome may compensate for the other with the mutation.  \nIn these conditions, the pattern of the building blocks of the FMR1 gene, or trinucleotides, are altered  by \nan increased repeat of patterns of nucleotides cytosine -guanine -guanine ( CGG ) on the FMR1 gene. \nDependent upon the degree of increased CGG repeats, the mutation is referred to as eithe r a premutation \nor a full mutation , and can change  over generations by inheritance. Clinical signs and symptoms of \nFragile X syndrome present with full mutation of the CGG repeats on the FMR1 gene while clinical presentation of FXTAS or premature ovarian i nsufficiency may develop in individuals with the FMR1 \nCGG premutation.  \n• Normal 5 -44 CGG repeats . \nPremutation 55- 200 CGG repeats means they carry the unstable mutation and can expand in future \ngenerations.  \nFull mutation > 200 CGG repeats  \n\nPage 2 of 4  Disclaimer____________________________________________________________________ \n \nCoverage is limited to that outlined in Medicaid Rule  or Health Care Administrative Rules that pertains to \nthe member’s  aid category.

Benefit determinations are based in all cases on the applicable contract \nlanguage. To the extent there may be any conflict between the Medical Policy and contract language, the contract \nlanguage takes precedence.  \nPLEASE NOTE: Contracts exclude from coverage, among other things, services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers may bill members for services or procedures that are \nconsidered investigational or cosmetic. Providers are e ncouraged to inform members before rendering such \nservices that the members are likely to be financially responsible for the cost of these services.  \n \nDESCRIPTION  \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is defined as targeted sequencing of the subset of the human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein- coding DNA.  Whole \ngenome sequencing (WGS) uses next -generation sequencing techniques to sequence both \ncoding- and non- coding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed to be \nmore efficient than traditional sequencing methods in discovering the genetic causes of diseases  and other indications . \nMEDICAL POLICY CRITERIA  \n \nNote:  This policy does not address tumor tissue or cell -free DNA testing for targeted \ntreatment of cancer (see Cross References  section ). \nI. Whole exome sequencing may be considered medically necessary for the evaluation \nof unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in pediatric patients (age 17 \nyears and younger) when all of the following criteria (A. – C.) are met:  \nA. The patient has had a clinical evaluation and has been informed about the \npotential risks of genetic testing; and \nB. There is clinical documentation that  whole exome sequencing results will guide \ndecisions for medical management; and \nC. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the patient’s \n\n\nGT76 | 2 phenotype, and one of the following is met:  \n1. The clinical presentation is not consistent with a well -described genetic \nsyndrome for which targeted genetic testing is available; or  \n2. Previous targeted genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis and whole \nexome sequencing may prevent the need for  invasive procedures as the next \ndiagnostic step (e.g. , muscle biopsy) .  \nII. Whole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic \ndisorders when Criterion I. is not met, including but not limited to prenatal or \npreimplantation testing.  \nIII. Whole genome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \nIV. Whole transcriptome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders is considered \ninvestigational  for all indications.  \n \nNOTE: A summary of the supporting rationale for the policy criteria is at the end of the policy.  \nLIST OF INFORMATION NEEDED FOR REVIEW  \nSUBMISSION OF GENETIC TESTING DOCUMENTATION \nAll of the following information must be submitted for review prior to the genetic testing:  \n• Name of genetic test(s)  and/or panel test   \n• Name of performing laboratory and/or genetic testing organization (more than one may \nbe listed)  \n• Date of blood draw or sample collection  \n• Relevant billing codes  \n• Brief description of how the genetic test results will guide clinical decisions that would \nnot otherwise be made in the absence of testing \n• Clinical d ocumentation that the risks of testing have been discussed \nCROSS REFERENCES  \n1.

It is being implemented for genetic testing \nmedical evidence review updates starting in 2017. According to this nomenclature, the term “variant” is used to describe a change in a DNA or protein sequence, repl acing previously \nused terms, such as “mutation.” Pathogenic variants are variants associated with disease, \nwhile benign variants are not. The majority of genetic changes have unknown effects on human health, and these are referred to as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) . \nCurrently available clinical assays designed for the molecular diagnosis of rare Mendelian diseases are incomplete. This is due to genetic heterogeneity, the presence of unknown \ncausative genes, and because only a portion of the known genes and variant s can be \nefficiently tested using conventional molecular methods. Recently, next -generation sequencing \n(NGS)  technologies have become more accessible in terms of cost and speed and have been \nadopted by a growing number of molecular genetic clinical laboratories.  \nDepending on the disorder and the degree of genetic and clinical heterogeneity, the current \ndiagnostic pathway for patients with suspected genetic disorders accompanied by multiple anomalies may depend on various combinations of low -yield radiographic, \nelectrophysiological, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic evaluations.\n[2] The search for a \ndiagnosis may thus become a time- consuming and expensive process. When a disease-\ncausing gene(s) is established, assays based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  technology, \nfor example, can be designed to specifically detect known variant s for clinical diagnosis. When \nmany different single -nucleotide variants (SNVs)  in a gene are possible, Sanger sequencing, \nthe current gold standard for detecting unknown SNVs , can be employed to determine the \nentire sequence of the coding and intron/exon splice sites of gene regions where variant s are \nmost likely to be found. However, when genes are large and variant s are possible in many or \nall exons (protein- coding regions of the gene), and when there is genetic (locus) heterogeneity, \ncomprehensive Sanger sequencing may be prohibitively laborious and costly.  \nWES using NGS technology is a relatively new approach to obtaining a genetic diagnosis in \npatients more efficiently compared with traditional methods. Exome sequencing has the capacity to determine an individual’s exomic variation profile in a single assay. This profile is \nlimited to most of the protein coding sequence of an individual (approximately 85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons, and constitutes approximately 1% of the whole genome. It is believed that the exome contains about 85% of heritable disease- causing \nvariant s. \nPublished studies have show n that exome sequencing can be used to detect previously \nannotated pathogenic variant s and reveal new likely pathogenic variant s in known and \nunknown genes. A limited number of studies have reported that the diagnostic yield of exome \nsequencing  appears to be significantly increased above that of traditional Sanger sequencing, \nwhile  also being faster and more efficien t relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.  \nWGS uses similar techniques to WES but involves the sequencing of noncoding DNA in addition to the protein- coding segments of the genome.  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing involves the use of NGS to sequence RNA molecules instead of DNA.  \nLIMITATIONS OF WES  AND WGS \n\nGT76 | 4 At this time, the limitations of WES  and WGS  include technical and implementation challenges. \nThere are issues of error rates due to uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture prior \nto sequencing, and difficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without losing likely candidate variant s. It is difficult to filter and interpret \npotential causative variants from the large number of variants of unknown significance (VUS)  \ngenerated for each patient. Variant databases are poorly annotated, and algorithms for annotating variants will need to be automated. Existing databases that catalog variants and putative disease associations are known to have significant entry error rates.  \nApproaches for characterizing the functional impact of rare and novel variants (i.e., achieving full-genome clinical interpretations that are scientifically sound and medically relevant) have to \nbe improved. The variability contributed by the different platforms and procedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service is unknown, and detailed guidance from regulatory and professional organizations is still under development. Finally, exome sequencing has some similar limitations as Sanger sequencing and will not \nidentify the following: intronic sequences or gene regulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions, duplications or rearrangements within genes; nucleotide repeats; or epigenetic changes. WGS address some of these limitations but is limited by the need for increased analytic power and the likelihood of greater identification of VUS. \nThere are also ethical questions about reporting incidental findings such as identifying \nmedically relevant variant s in genes unrelated to the diagnostic question, sex chromosome \nabnormalities, and non- paternity when family studies are performed. Standards for the \nrequired components of informed consent before WES/WGS is performed have been proposed and include a description of confidentiality and a description of how incidental findings will be managed.\n[3] Methods of reporting findings from WES/WGS are in development. \nFor example, McLaughlin et al, reporting on the MedSeq Project which is testing methods for evaluating and reporting WES/WGS data, described the development of a genome report that highlights results  that are significant to the indication being evaluated.\n[4] \nRESULTS OF TESTING WITH WES/WGS[5] \n1. A variant known to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• This is a sequence variant that has been shown through prior genetic and clinical research to cause a disease.  \n2. A variant suspected to cause human disease is identified. This is also known as a pathogenic variant.  \n• Most variants detected by WES sequencing are uncharacterized and some are \nnovel (i.e., never known to have been observed in a human sample). Some variants \nallow for relatively easy and accurate clinical interpretation; however, for most there is little dat a on which to base an assessment of causality. Tools to facilitate the \nassessment of causality include bioinformatic analyses, predicted structural changes, and others. While these tools may be useful, their predictive power is highly variable. In addition, each clinical laboratory offering WES/WGS testing have their own “in- house” algorithm to facilitate assessment and classification of these \nvariants.  \n\nGT76 | 5 3. A variant of uncertain significance (VOUS/VUS)  is identified.   \n• Among the known 30,000 to 40,000 variants that reside in the protein- coding \nportions of the genome, the typical subject will have three to eight  actionable \nvariants. (Most relate to reproductive risks, i .e., heterozygous carrier alleles.) But the \nremaining thousands are either highly likely to be benign or of uncertain clinical \nsignificance. It can be equally as challenging to prove that a variant is benign as it is to prove it is pathogenic. Currently, nearly all variants among the tens of thousands must b e considered of uncertain significance.   \nAVAILABLE TESTING SERVICES  \nWES  \nExamples of some laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical service and their \nindications for testing are summarized in the table below.  \nLaboratory  Laboratory indications for testing \nAmbry Genetics  “The patient's clinical presentation is unclear/atypical disease and there are \nmultiple genetic conditions in the differential diagnosis.”  \nGeneDx  “a patient with a diagnosis that suggests the involvement of one or more of many different genes, which would, if even available and sequenced individually, be prohibitively expensive”  \nBaylor College of Medicine “used when a patient’s medical history and physical exam findings strongly \nsuggest that there is an underlying genetic etiology. In some cases, the \npatient may have had an extensive evaluation consisting of multiple genetic tests, without identifying an etiology.” Baylor also offers a prenatal WES \ntest. \nUniversity of California Los Angeles Health System  “This test is intended for use in conjunction with the clinical presentation and other markers of disease progression for the management of patients with rare genetic disorders.”  \nEdgeBio Recommended “In situations where there has been a diagnostic failure with no discernible path . . . In situations where there are currently no available \ntests to determine the status of a potential genetic disease . . . In situations \nwith atypical findings  indicative of multiple disease[s]”  \nChildren’s Mercy Hospitals and Clinics  Provided as a service to families with children who have had an extensive negative work -up for a genetic disease; also used to identify novel disease \ngenes.  \nEmory Genetics Laboratory  “Indicated when there is a suspicion of a genetic etiology contributing to the proband’s manifestations.”  \nKnight Diagnostic Laboratory  “diagnosing rare hereditary diseases, inconclusive results from targeted panel tests, presentation of multiple phenotypes or when a patient presents an unknown or novel phenotype.”  \nWGS  \nAlthough WGS has been used as a research tool, it is less well -developed as a clinical service. \nSeveral laboratories offer WGS as a clinical service. \n\nGT76 | 6 Transcriptome Sequencing  \nWhole transcriptome sequencing is primarily used as a research tool, but several labs now \noffer such testing for clinical purposes.  \nREGULATORY STATUS  \nNo U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -cleared genotyping tests were found. Thus, \ngenotyping is offered as a laboratory -developed test. Clinical laboratories may develop and \nvalidate tests in- house (“home- brew”) and market them as a laboratory service.  Such tests \nmust meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). \nThe laboratory offering the service must be licensed by CLIA for high- complexity testing.  \nEVIDENCE SUMMARY  \nValidation of the clinical use of any genetic test focuses on three main principles:  \n1. The analytic validity of the test, which refers to the technical accuracy of the test in detecting a variant  that is present or in excluding a variant  that is absent;  \n2. The clinical validity of the test, which refers to the diagnostic performance of the test (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) in detecting clinical disease; and  \n3. The clinical utility of the test, i.e., how the results of the diagnostic test will be used to change management of the patient and whether these changes in management lead to clinically important improvements in health outcomes.  \nThe focus of the literature search was on evidence related to the ability of genetic test results to: \n• Guide decisions in the clinical setting related to either treatment, management, or prevention, and  \n• Improve health outcomes as a result of those decisions.  \nWHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING (WES)  \nThe clinical validity  of WES is related to the diagnostic performance of this technology, while \nthe clinical utility lies in the influence of the results on medical decision making and patient outcomes. For  clinical utility to be established, evidence would be needed of the ability of WES \nto provide the following improvements over other testing methods:  \n• Ability to establish a definitive diagnosis by detection of additional variant s not found by \nother testing methods and leading to management changes that improve outcomes and/or eliminate the need for additional testing   \n• Equivalent or superior accuracy attained with superior efficiency of workup (e.g., diagnosis obtained more quickly) compared with other methods of sequencing.  \nTechnology Assessments \nA 2013 BlueCross BlueShield Association Technology Evaluation Center (TEC) Special Report \non WES in patients with suspected genetic disorders, found no published studies that systematically examined potential outcomes of interest such as changes in medical  \nmanagement (including revision of initial diagnoses), and changes in reproductive decision \n\nGT76 | 7 making after a diagnosis of a Mendelian disorder by WES.[6] The evidence was limited to a \nsmall number of studies of patient series and a larger number of very small series or family \nstudies that reported anecdotal examples of medical management and reproductive decision-making outcomes of exome sequencing in patients who were not diagnosed by traditional methods. These studies showed that, over and above traditional molecular and conventional diagnostic testing, exome sequencing could lead to a diagnosis that influenced patient care and/or reproductive decisions but gave no indication of the proportion of patients for which this was true. The report noted that publication of a large number of small diagnostic studies with positive results but few with negative results raise the possibility of publication bias, the impact of which is unknown.  \nIn 2020, the Washington State Health Care Authority released a technology assessment of \nWES.\n[7] Information on the diagnostic yield of WES was calculated using data from 99 studies. \nThe overall pooled estimate for this was 38% (95% confidence interval [CI] 35.7% to 40.6%), \nwhile the pooled yield for gene panels and traditional testing pathways were 27% (95% CI 13.7% to 40.5%) and 21% (95% CI 5.6% to 36.4%), respectively.  The diagnostic yield \ngenerally decreased with increasing patient age. The clinical utility of WES was assessed based on data from 30 studies, most of which were single- arm observational cohort studies. \nThe key findings from this assessment were:  \n• “Among studies that enrolled patients with diverse phenotypes (18 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 12% to 100%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 5% to 25%  \no A WES diagnosis resulted in counseling and genetic testing for family members for between 4% and 97%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with epilepsy (5 studies):  \no A WES diagnosis changed clinical management for between 0% to 31%  \no A WES diagnosis changed medication for between 0% to 20%  \n• Among studies that enrolled patients with a single phenotype (7 studies), all reported some changes in clinical management following a WES diagnosis, but the data was too heterogenous to synthesize into a single range.”  \nThe certainty of the evidence related to clinical utility was rated as very low due to study limitations including study design, inconsistency, and imprecision. Evidence related to health outcomes could not be evaluated due to the substantial limitations in study design and outcome reporting among the seven studies that reported these outcomes.  \nWES f\nor Children with Multiple Congenital Anomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of \nUnknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nSince the publication of the 2013 TEC Special Report, several studies have been published that address the use of either WES (see Table 1)  in clinical practice. Typically, the populations \nincluded in these studies have had suspected rare genetic disorders, although the specific populations vary.  Smith (2019 ) reported a scoping review of genome and exome sequencing \nas a diagnostic tool for pediatric patients.\n[8] The authors identified 171 publications, although \n131 were case reports. They concluded that diagnostic yield was the only consistently reported outcome. The median diagnostic yield in publications including more than single case reports was 33% but varied by broad clinical categories and test type.  \nSeries have been reported with as many as 2, 000 patients. The most common reason for \nreferral to a tertiary care center was an unexplained neurodevelopmental disorder. Many \n\nGT76 | 8 patients had been through standard clinical workup and testing without identification of a \ngenetic variant to explain their condition. Diagnostic yield in these studies, defined as the proportion of tested patients with clinically relevant genomic abnormalities, ranged from 25% to 48%. Because there is no reference standard for the diagnosis of patients who have exhausted alternative testing strategies, clinical confirmation may be the only method for determining false- positive and false- negative rates. No reports were identified of incorrect \ndiagnoses, and how often they might occur is unclear. When used as a first -line test in infants \nwith multiple congenital abnormalities and dysmorphic features, diagnostic yield may be as high as 58%. Testing parent -child trios has been reported to increase diagnostic yield, to \nidentify an inherited variant from an unaffected parent and be considered benign, or to identify a de novo variant not present in an unaffected parent. First -line trio testing for children with \ncomplex  neurologic disorders was shown to increase the diagnostic yield (29%, plus a possible \ndiagnostic finding in 27%) compared with a standard clinical pathway (7%) performed in parallel in the same patients .\n[9] \nTable 1.

These series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 22% to 58%, depending on the individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. Comparative studies have reported an increase in diagnostic yield compared with standard testing strategies. Thus, for individuals who have a suspected genetic etiology but for whom the specific genetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. A genetic diagnosis for these patients is reported to change management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. \nWES for Children with a Suspected Genetic Disorder Other Than Multiple Congenital \nAnomalies or a Neurodevelopmental Disorder of Unknown Etiology Following Standard Workup \nMost of the literature on WES is on neurodevelopmental disorders in children; however, other \npotential indications for WES have been reported (see Table 2 ). These include limb- girdle \nmuscular dystrophy, inherited retinal disease, and other disorders including mitochondrial, endocrine, and immunologic disorders.  \nTable 2.

VUS: variant of uncertain significance  \nSection Summary  \nThere is an increasing number of reports assessing use of WES identify a molecular basis for \ndisorders other than multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies ranged from 3% for colorectal cancer to 60% for trio (parents and child) analysis of limb- girdle muscular dystrophy. Some studies have reported on the use \nof a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease- associated genes, and the authors \nnoted that WES data allows reanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder, and study of WES in these disorders is at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  \nWHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING (WGS)  \nA 2020 Health Technology Assessment conducted by Ontario Health, with literature searches conducted in January 2019, included a comparative review of the diagnostic yield of WES and WGS in children with unexplained developmental disabilities or multiple congenital anomalies.\n[47] The diagnostic yield across all studies was 37% (95% CI 34% to 40%). More \nstudies, with an overall larger sample size, were included in the examination on WES (34 \n\nGT76 | 15 studies, n=9,142) than on whole genome sequencing (nine studies, n=648). Confidence \nintervals for studies using WES versus WGS overlapped (37%, 95% CI 34% to 40% vs. 40%, \n95% CI 32% to 49%). Diagnostic yield ranged between 16% and 73%, with variation attributed largely to technology used and participant selection. The overall quality of the evidence was \nrated as very low, downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, and imprecision.  \nThis body of evidence suggests that the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup. However, it is not possible to determine from these studies the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis following WES.  \nIn some studies of WGS, the genes examined were those previously associated with the phenotype, while other studies were research -based and conducted more exploratory analysis. \nIt has been noted that genomes sequenced with WGS are available for future review when new variants associated with clinical diseases are discovered.\n[48] Studies have shown that \nWGS can detect more pathogenic variants than WES, due to an improvement in detecting copy number variants, insertions and deletions, intronic single nucleotide variants, and exonic single nucleotide variants in regions with poor coverage on WES. Most studies of  WGS \nindicated that only pathogenic or likely -pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic \nyield and that variants of uncertain significance were not reported (see Table 3). Five studies included in the Ontario HTA review provided data on the yield of VUS, with an overall yield of 17%. Only one of the five  studies used WGS, however. The review authors noted, \"Whole \ngenome sequencing always results in substantially longer lists of variants of unknown significance than whole exome sequencing does. Interpreting and acting upon variants of unknown clinical significance is the single greatest challenge identified by clinicians….”\n[47] \nThe use of WGS and rapid WGS has been studied in critically ill children in several observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, two  randomized controlled trial s \n(RCTs), and one systematic review. Studies are described in Table 6. The systematic review \nand RCTs are discussed in more detail in the following systematic review and r andomized \ncontrolled trials sections. One study included only infants with cardiac defects and had a \ndiagnostic yield of 6% with WGS. The remaining studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60%.  \nTable 3.

Three RCTs were included. The mean age of study participants was two days to 18 years. The quality of evidence was rated as \n\nGT76 | 21 high for the included RCTs and moderate for the observational studies.  The meta- analysis \nrevealed a statistically significantly higher  pooled diagnostic yield for WGS, 38.6% (95% CI  \n32.6 to 45.0) , compared to WES, 37.8% (95% CI  32.9 to 42.9) , and usual care, 7.8% (95% CI  \n4.4 to 13.2) . The review authors concluded that although whole genome sequencing for the \npediatric population with suspected genetic disorders provided an accurate and early genetic \ndiagnosis in a high proportion of cases, further research is needed to evaluate costs, effectiveness, and cost -effectiveness of WGS.  \nRandomized Controlled Trials  \nKingsmore (2019) reported early results of a randomized trial comparing rapid WGS (rWGS) to \nrapid WES (rWES) for seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology at a single center  \n(NSIGHT2 trial ).\n[35] Of the 578 eligible infants, 213 were enrolled in the study, 24 of whom were \nvery ill and received ultra- rapid WGS (ultra -rWGS) without randomization. Ninety -four of the \nremaining 189 infants were randomized to receive rWGS and 95 to receive rWES. The diagnostic yield of ultra -rWGS for the 24 very ill infants was 11 (46%)  and the median time to \nresult was 4.6 days. The diagnostic  yields were very similar for both randomized groups  (18/94 \n[19%] for rWGS and 19/95 [20%] for rWES), as were the times to results, which were 11.0 and \n11.2 days for rWGS and rWES, respectively.  Dimmock (2020)  reported results of the primary \nendpoint of NSIGHT2: clinician perception that rWGS was useful and clinic ian-reported \nchanges in management.\n[51] Clinicians provided perceptions of the clinical utility of diagnostic \ngenomic sequencing for 201 of 213 infants randomized (94%). In 154 (77%) infants, diagnostic genomic sequencing was perceived to be useful or very useful; perceptions of usefulness did not differ between infants who received rWES and rWGS, nor between ultra- rWGS and \nrWES/rWGS. Thirty -two (15%) of 207 clinician responses indicated that diagnostic genomic \nsequencing changed infant outcomes (by targeted treatments in 21 infants, avoidance of complications in 16, and institution of palliative care in two  infants). Changes in outcome did \nnot differ significantly between infants randomized to rWES and rWGS, although ultra- rWGS \nwas associated with a significantly  higher rate of change in manag ement than rWES/rWGS \n(63% vs. 23% , p=0.0001).  \nPetrikin (2018) reported on the INSIGHT1 RCT of rWGS  to diagnose suspected genetic \ndisorders in critically ill infants.\n[58] INSIGHT1 was an investigator -initiated (funded by National \nHuman Genome Research Institute [NHGRI] and Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [NICHD]), blinded, pragmatic trial comparing trio rWGS with standard genetic tests to standard genetic tests alone with a primary outcome of proportion of NICU/PICU infants receiving a genetic diagnosis within 28 days. Parents of patients and clinicians were unblinded after 10 days and compassionate cross -over to rWGS \noccurred in five  control patients. The study was designed to enroll 500 patients in each group \nbut was terminated early due to loss of equipoise on the part of study clinicians who began to regard standard tests alone as inferior to standard tests plus trio rWGS. Intention- to-treat \nanalyses were reported, i.e., crossovers were included in the group to which they were randomized. The trial required confirmatory testing of WGS results which lengthened the time to rWGS diagnosis by 7 to 10 days. Molecular diagnosis was achieved in 31% of the rWGS \ngroup, compared with 3% in the standard testing group (p=0.003). The time to diagnosis was also significantly shorter in the rWGS group (13 days vs. 107 days, p=0.002).  \nIn the NICUSeq RCT, Krantz (2021) compared rWGS (test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease at five  sites in the US.\n[50] In 76% of cases, both \n\nGT76 | 22 parents were available for trio testing. Overall, 82 of 354 infants received a diagnosis (23%), \nwith a higher yield in the 15- day group. The primary outcome was change in management, \nmeasured at day 60. Significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs 10.3% , p=0.009, odds ratio 2.3, 95% \nCI 1.22 to 4.32). Changes in management included subspecialty referral (21 of 354, 6.0%), changes to medication (5 of 354, 1.4%), therapeutics specific to the primary genetic etiology (7 of 354, 2.0%) and surgical interventions (12 of 354, 3.4%). Survival and length of stay did not \ndiffer between the groups.  \nSection Summary \nWGS has been studied in critically ill and non- critically ill children with congenital abnormalities \nand development delays of unknown etiology following standard workup.  The diagnostic yield \nfor WGS has been reported between 20% and 40%. Additional indirect evidence is available from studies reporting diagnostic yield and change in management results of WES in a similar population, and it is reasonable to expect that WGS is likely to result in similar or better diagnostic yield for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and similar changes in management as compared with WES. WGS has also been studied in children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup. The diagnostic yield of WGS has been between 9% and 55%.  However, these studies include mixed indications with heterogenous populations and include little information about associated changes in management following genetic diagnosis . \nWES/WGS FOR OTHER INDICATIONS \nWES/WGS for Preimplantation  \nPeters (2015) reported on the results of WGS performed on three 5- to 10- cell biopsies from \ntwo blastocyst -stage embryos in order to detect single base de novo variants and small \ninsertions and deletions.\n[73] Both parents and paternal grandparents were also analyzed in \norder to measure false- positive and false- negative error rates. Overall, great than 95% of each \ngenome was called. Experimentally derived haplotypes were used to detect up to 82% of de \nnovo SNVs with a false -positive rate of about one error per gigabase, resulting in fewer than \n10 errors per embryo. The authors state that this represents an approximately 100- fold lower \nerror rate than previously published from 10- cell embryos, and it is the first  demonstration that \nWGS can be used to accurately identify de novo variants in spite of the thousands of false-positive errors introduced by the extensive DNA amplification required for deep sequencing.  \nWES/WGS for Pre natal Fetal Testing \nGirolamo (2023) published a systematic review and meta- analysis to estimate the incremental \nyield of detecting pathogenic or likely pathogenic diagnostic genetic variants (DGV) by whole exome sequencing (WES) over standard karyotype and chromosomal microarray (CMA) analyses in fetuses with isolated increased nuchal translucency (NT) and normal fetal anatomy at the time of 11- 14 weeks scan.\n[74] The secondary outcomes were the detection of a genetic \nvariant of unknown significance. Sub- analysis according to different NT cutoffs (between 3.0 \nand 5.5 mm and > 5.5 mm) and considering fetuses with isolated NT in which fetal anatomy was confirmed to be normal at the anomaly scan were also performed.  Eight articles (324 \nfetuses) were included in the systematic review. Of the fetuses with negative standard karyotype and CMA analysis, the 8.07% (95% CI 5.4 to 11.3) had pathogenic or likely \n\nGT76 | 23 pathogenic genetic variants detected exclusively by WES. When stratifying the analysis \naccording to NT cutoffs, genetic anomalies detected exclusively at WES analysis were found in 44.70% (95% CI 26.8 to 63.4) of fetuses with NT between 3.0 mm and 5.5 mm and 55.3% \n(95% CI 36.6 to 73.2) in those fetuses with NT >5.5 mm and positive WES results. The 7.84% \n(95% CI 1.6 to18.2) had variants of unknown significance identified by WES.  Pathogenic and \nlikely pathogenic genetic variants detected by WES are present in a significant proportion of \nfetuses with increased NT but normal standard karyotype and CMA analysis, also when no anomalies are detected at the anomaly scan. Further large studies sharing objective protocols of imaging assessment are needed to confirm these findings . \nMellis (2022) published a systematic review and meta- analysis of WES for prenatal diagnosis \nof fetal structural anomalies, which included data from 66 studies  and 4, 350 fetuses  that had \nnormal karyotype or CMA testing.\n[75] The incremental diagnostic yield of WES in this setting \nwas reported to be 31% (95% CI 26% to 36% ) and was higher in cases that were pre- selected \nas likely having monogenic disorders (42% vs. 15%). By phenotype, the yield was also higher in cases with skeletal abnormalities (53%) and lowest in cases with isolated increased nuchal translucency (2%).  \nWES/WGS for Pregnancy Loss  \nQiao (2016) evaluated the use of WES to identify genetic causes of idiopathic recurrent early pregnancy loss (RPL), assessing seven euploid miscarriages from four families with RPL.\n[76] \nThe study identified compound heterozygous pathogenic variants of DYNC2H1  and ALOX15  in \ntwo out of four families with RPL. Although the authors concluded that CNVs, individual SNVs and pool of deleterious gene variants identified by exome sequencing could contribute to RPL, they acknowledge that the study has limitations, mainly the small  sample cohort is small and \nthat functional analysis of the candidate variants must be evaluated to determine whether the variants are causative.  \nWHOLE TRANSCRIPTOME SEQUENCING  \nTranscriptome sequencing has been used mainly as a research tool to identify potential \nmarkers for understanding disease pathologies or identifying markers for disease detection. \nLimited clinical studies of transcriptome sequencing have been published. For  example, a \nstudy by Walter (2021) compared whole transcriptome sequencing to WGS in 279 patients \nwith acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; B-cell n=211, T- cell n = 68) .[77] Transcriptome \nsequencing was able to distinguish between B -cell ALL and T- cell ALL based on the \nexpression of 14 markers, and it was used to identify  a number of gene fusions.   \nPRACTICE GUIDELINE SUMMARY \nAMERICAN COLLEGE OF MEDICAL GENETICS \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical \npractice guideline for the use of WES and WGS in pediatric patients and made the following recommendation: \"We strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second- tier test \n(guided by clinical judgment and often clinician- patient/family shared decision making after \nCMA or focused testing) for patients with one or more [congenital anomalies]  prior to one year \nof age or for patients with [developmental delay/intellec tual disability]  with onset prior to 18 \nyears of age.\"\n[78] The recommendation was informed by a systematic evidence review and a \nhealth technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.  \n\nGT76 | 24 In 2015, ACMG published a policy statement updating their 2013 their recommendation s for \nanalysis and reporting of secondary/ incidental findings in whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing .[79, 80] \n• The panel states that patients must be made aware, it the time of consent, that \nlaboratories routinely analyze the sequence of a set of genes deemed to be highly medically actionable so as to detect pathogenic variants that may predispose to a severe but preventable disease. \n• Although patients have the choice to opt out of receiving these results, that they should be made aware of the ramifications of doing so.  \nDue to the inherent difficulty of counseling patients about the features of each disorder and every gene deemed actionable by the ACMG, analysis and reporting of secondary findings should apply to the entire list of medically actionable genes, and not a subset.  \nSUMMARY  \nThere is enough research to show that whole exome sequencing (WES) can increase diagnosis rates and improve health outcomes for certain children who are suspected of having a genetic disorder. In some situations, WES testing may prevent the need for more invasive diagnostic tests, such as muscle biopsy. Therefore, WES may be considered \nmedically necessary when policy criteria are met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole exome sequencing (WES) improves health outcomes for patients who do not meet the policy criteria, including adults and individuals with signs and symptoms consistent with a well -known disorder that can be \nidentified by targeted testing. Therefore, WES is considered investigational when policy criteria are not met.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole genome sequencing (WGS) can \nbe used to improve patient health outcomes.  In addition, there are technical limitations such \nas the lack of standardized laboratory procedures, gaps in interpreting ancillary information, and the detection of variants of uncertain significance. Therefore, the use of WGS  is \nconsidered investigational for all indications.  \nThere is not enough research to determine whether whole transcriptome sequencing can be used to improve patient health outcomes.  This technology has been primarily used in the \nresearch setting and there is little evidence regarding its clinical use.  Therefore, whole \ntranscriptome sequencing is considered investigational for all indications.  \nREFERENCES  \n 1. den Dunnen JT, Dalgleish R, Maglott DR, et al.

For trio testing and rapid WES/WGS please see MP 2.324 Whole Exome \nand Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders . \nA guideline update from American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, Schaefer et at [2013]) \nstates that a stepwise (or tiered) approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of autism \nspectrum disorder is recommended, with the recommendation being for first tier to include \nfragile X syndrome and CMA testing. CMA testing is recommended as first-tier evaluation in \nindividuals who have the following: \n “Multiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.”  \n “Apparently non-syndromic DD [developmental delay]/ID [intellectual disability].”  \n “Autism spectrum disorders”  \nRecommendations from the American College of Medical Genetics (Manning and Hudgins \n[2010]) on array-based technologies and their clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal \nabnormalities include the following: “Appropriate follow-up is recommended in cases of \nchromosome imbalance identified by CMA, to include cytogenetic/FISH [fluorescent in situ \nhybridization] studies of the patient, parental evaluation, and clinical genetic evaluation and \ncounseling.” \nThe International Standard Cytogenomic Array Consortium (ISCA, 2010) recommends offering \nCMA as a first-tier genetic test, in place of karyotype, for individuals with unexplained \ndevelopmental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, or birth defects.  \nIn some cases of CMA analysis, the laboratory performing the test confirms all reported copy \nnumber variants with an alternative technology such as fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. \nPer the American Academy of Pediatrics, chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing are \nrecommended for all children with ASD to predict prognosis. Chromosomal microarray will \nreveal genetic abnormalities in up to 42% of children with ASD. Fragile X testing is positive in \nless than 1% of patients with ASD, but it is important for genetic counseling. Targeted testing for \ndisorders such as tuberous sclerosis and Rett syndrome is useful only if presentation suggests \nthese disorders. Whole exome sequencing shows an abnormality in up to one-fifth of patients \nwith ASD and can be considered if other testing is negative.  \nIn 2020, the Pediatric Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing Guideline Work Group (Peds \nES/GS GWG) was convened to develop an evidence- based guideline for the clinical use of \nES/GS in patients with CA/DD/ID. They strongly recommended exome sequencing and genome \nsequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician–\n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 3  \npatient/ family shared decision making after CMA or focused testing) for patients with one or \nmore CAs prior to one year of age or for patients with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age. \nThis recommendation is echoed by the ACMG.  \nACMG (2012) stated “Before initiating GS/ES, counseling should be performed by a medical \ngeneticist or an affiliated genetic counselor and should include written documentation of consent \nfrom the patient.” \nGENETICS NOMENCLATURE UPDATE \nThe Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants \nfound in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. The nomenclature is \nbeing implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see \nTable PG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the \nHUman Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

Interpreting the results of genetic tests and \nunderstanding risk factors can be difficult for some patients; genetic counseling helps individuals \nunderstand the impact of genetic testing, including the possible effects the test results could \nhave on the individual or their family members. It should be noted that genetic counseling may \nalter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing; further, \ngenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. counseling should be performed by an individual \nwith experience and expertise in genetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \n \n  Cross-references:  \nMP 2.276 Genetic Testing for Pathogenic FMR1 Variants (Including Fragile \nX Syndrome) \nMP 2.304 Autism Spectrum Disorders \nMP 2.324 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of \nGenetic Disorders \nMP 7.009 Preimplantation Genetic Testing \n \nII.

DESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nDevelopmental Delay/Intellectual Disability  \nDevelopmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), and congenital anomalies (CA) are among \nthe most common indications for genetic referral in the pediatric population and comprise a \nheterogeneous group of conditions that can impact a child’s physical, learning, or behavioral \nfunction. Identification of an underlying diagnosis for DD/ID/CA can lead to changes in \nmanagement that will influence mortality, morbidity, and reduce the burden on patients and \nfamilies searching for answers  \nDevelopmental delay is diagnosed in children 5 years or younger who show a significant delay \nin two or more developmental domains: gross or fine motor, speech/language, cognitive, \nsocial/personal, and activities of daily living., DD can precede the development of intellectual \ndisability (ID) as the child ages., \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 5  \nID is manifest by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. It is \ndiagnosed at or after age 5 (when intelligence testing is considered valid and reliable) but prior \nto age 18 and is lifelong. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fifth \nEdition (DSM-5 ) defines ID as occurring during the developmental period and involving \nimpairments of general mental abilities (e.g., IQ less than 70 or 75) that impact adaptive \nfunctioning in the conceptual, social, and practical domains. The causes of ID are extensive and \ninclude conditions that interfere with brain development and functioning. Among the known \ncauses of ID, the majority are genetic abnormalities.  \nThe national prevalence of DD and ID were estimated at 4.1% and 1.2%, respectively, in US \nchildren based on data from the 2009 to 2017 National Health Interview Survey. Both are \ninfluenced by genetic, environmental, infectious, and perinatal factors. Approximately 450 genes \nhave been causally related to ID; most genes ( 90%) are associated with syndromes. \nInheritance of ID can be autosomal-dominant, recessive, or X-linked; and most nonsyndromic \ngenes are located on the X chromosome. Prior to the advent of whole-exome and genome \nsequencing, Willemsen and Kleefstra (2014) concluded that 20% to 40% of ID cases could be \nattributed to a genetic variant. With the use of whole-genome sequencing, they estimated \nalmost 60% of cases have an identifiable genetic etiology. \nCongenital anomalies are frequently present in children with DD and ID. In addition, a \nsuspected etiology can often be established from history and physical examination (in skilled \nspecialists as much as 20% to 40% of cases) without genetic testing. The recommended \napproach to evaluation in DD/ID begins with a 3-generation family history and physical \n(including neurologic) exam. Subsequent testing is used to confirm a suspected diagnosis (e.g., \ntargeted fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] testing for DiGeorge or cri-du-chat syndromes). \nIf no diagnosis is suspected, fragile X syndrome testing, metabolic testing for inborn errors of \nmetabolism, and chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing (without karyotyping) are \nrecommended-regardless of the presence or absence of dysmorphologic features or congenital \nanomalies., \nAutism Spectrum Disorder \nDSM-5  defines autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as the presence of \n Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple \ncontexts, \n Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, \n Symptoms in the early developmental period (typically recognized in the first 2 years of \nlife), and \n Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other \nimportant areas of current functioning. \nThe estimated prevalence of ASD in US children based on data from the 2009 to 2017 National \nHealth Interview Survey was 2.5%. ASD is 4 to 5 times more common in boys than girls, and \nwhite children are more often identified with ASD than black or Hispanic children. An accurate \ndiagnosis can generally be made by age 2. The evaluation includes developmental screening \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 6  \nand diagnostic evaluation (i.e., hearing, vision, neurologic, laboratory testing for metabolic \ndisorders, and genetic testing).  \nA large body of evidence supports a genetic etiology in ASD. Twin studies estimate heritability \nbetween 60% and 90%. A family with an affected child has a 13% to 19% risk for recurrence in \nsubsequent children. Based on Swedish genetic studies, Gaugler et al (2014) concluded that \n“the bulk of autism arises from genetic variation” (as opposed to environmental causes). Still, \nalthough genetic determinants can be heritable, most appear to arise de novo. \nFor these reasons, a child with ASD is often evaluated with genetic testing. Testing may be \ntargeted when a child has a recognizable syndrome such as those shown in Table 1. \nAlternatively, high-resolution cytogenetic analysis evaluating multiple genes-the focus of this \nevidence review-is used.  \nTable 1. Examples of Specific Genes Associated With Disorders That Include Autistic \nBehaviors \n Gene (Syndrome)   Patient Selection  Yield, %  Reference \n FMR1 (fragile X)  Unselected autism  3-10 \n Schaefer and Mendelsohn \n (2008)24  MECP2 (Rett)  Females with nonsyndromic  \n autism, intellectual disability, and  \n cerebral palsy   3-13 \n PTEN   Autism with macrocephaly  ≤17  Butler et al (2005)25 \n \nDiagnostic Testing \nKaryotyping and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization \nThe goal of a cytogenetic evaluation is to identify chromosomal imbalances that cause a \ndisorder. The most common imbalances are copy number variants (CNVs) or deletions and \nduplications of large segments of genomic material. CNVs are common in DD/ID and ASD but \nmore often reflect the normal genetic variation. However, de novo CNVs are observed about \nfour times more frequently in children with ASD than in normal individuals. Less frequently, \nother abnormalities such as balanced translocations (i.e., exchanges of equally sized DNA loci \nbetween chromosomes) may be pathogenic. For many well-described syndromes, the type and \nlocation of the associated chromosomal abnormality have been established by studying large \npatient samples. For others, few patients with similar abnormalities may have been evaluated to \nestablish genotype-phenotype correlation. Finally, in some patients, cytogenetic analysis will \ndiscover chromosomal abnormalities that require study to determine their significance. \nPrior to the advent of CMAs, the initial step in cytogenetic analysis was G-banded karyotyping, \nwhich evaluates all chromosomes. High-resolution G-banding can detect changes as small as 3 \nto 5 megabases in size, although standard G-banding evaluates more than ten megabases \nchanges. In children with DD/ID, a review by Stankiewicz and Beaudet (2007) found G-banded \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 7  \nkaryotyping diagnostic in approximately 3% to 5% of cases. In ASD, high-resolution karyotyping \nappears to identify abnormalities in up to 5% of cases. \nChromosomal rearrangements in the gene-rich subtelomeric region are identified in \napproximately 4 to 6 percent of children with ID. Molecular screening using FISH of \nsubtelomeric probes was used widely in the past to identify these abnormalities; however, CMA \nhas replaced FISH as the test of choice, since the majority of diagnostic CMA arrays offer dense \ncoverage of subtelomeric regions. FISH may still be substituted if array diagnosis is not \navailable or if a specific telomeric disorder (e.g., DiGeorge syndrome, Cri-du-chat syndrome) is \nstrongly suspected clinically.  \nIn contrast, molecular cytogenetic techniques can detect small submicroscopic chromosomal \nalterations. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) a targeted approach, is used to identify \nspecific chromosomal abnormalities associated with suspected diagnoses such as DiGeorge \nsyndrome. Prior to CMAs, FISH was also used to screen the rearrangement-prone subtelomeric \nregions. Subtelomeric FISH was found to identify abnormalities in children with DD and ID, \ndiagnostic in approximately 5% to 6% of those with negative karyotypes, but uncommonly in \nASD.  \nChromosomal Microarrays \nTwo types of CMAs are considered here: array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and \nsingle nucleotide variants (SNV) arrays. The aCGH approach uses DNA samples from a patient \nand a normal control. Each is labeled with distinct fluorescent dyes (red or green). The labeled \nsamples are then mixed and hybridized to thousands of cloned or synthesized reference \n(normal) DNA fragments of known genomic locus immobilized on a glass slide (microarray) to \nconduct thousands of comparative reactions simultaneously. CNVs are determined by computer \nanalysis of the array patterns and intensities of the hybridization signals. If the patient sequence \nis missing part of the normal sequence (a deletion) or has the normal sequence plus additional \ngenomic material within that genomic location (e.g., a duplication), the sequence imbalance is \ndetected as a difference in fluorescence intensity (Korf and Rehm [2013] offer an illustrative \ngraphic). For this reason, aCGH cannot detect balanced chromosomal translations (equal \nexchange of material between chromosomes) or sequence inversions (same sequence is \npresent in reverse base pair order) because the fluorescence intensity would not change. A \nportion of the increased diagnostic yield from CMA over karyotyping comes from the discovery \nthat chromosomal rearrangements that appear balanced (and therefore not pathogenic) by G-\nbanded karyotype analysis are found to have small imbalances with greater resolution. It has \nbeen estimated that 40% of apparently balanced de novo or inherited translocations with \nabnormal phenotype are associated with cryptic deletion if analyzed by CMA testing. \nLike aCGH, SNV arrays detect CNVs. In an SNV array, the two alleles for genes of interest are \ntagged with different florescent dyes. Comparative florescence intensity will be increased when \nthere are duplications and diminished with deletions. The resolution provided by aCGH is higher \nthan with SNV arrays. In addition, aCGH has better signal-to-background characteristics than \nSNV arrays. In contrast to aCGH, SNV arrays will also identify long stretches of DNA \nhomozygosity, which may suggest uniparental disomy or consanguinity. Uniparental disomy \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 8  \noccurs when a child inherits two copies of a chromosome from one parent and no copies from \nthe other parent. Uniparental disomy can lead to syndromes such as Angelman and Prader-\nWilli.  \nTable 2 summarizes the cytogenetic tests used to evaluate children with DD/ID and autism. The \ntable emphasizes the large difference in resolution between karyotyping and CMA.  \nTable 2.

NGS involves the sequencing of millions of fragments of genetic material in a massively \nparallel fashion. NGS can be performed on segments of genetic material of various sizes from \nthe entire genome (whole-genome sequencing) to small subsets of genes (targeted \nsequencing). NGS allows the detection of SNVs, CNVs, insertions, and deletions. With higher \nresolution comes higher likelihood of detection of variants of uncertain significance. \nExome and Genome Sequencing \nExome sequencing utilizes DNA-enrichment methods and massively parallel nucleotide \nsequencing to identify disease-associated variants throughout the human genome. Exome \nsequencing is limited to the DNA sequence of coding regions (exons) and flanking intronic \nregions of the genome, which is estimated to contain 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. \nResults of testing with ES include known pathogenic variants definitely associated with disease \nor a variant of uncertain significance. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high \ndiagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at \nspecialty centers. Exome sequencing after standard testing increased the diagnostic yield at an \nadditional cost compared to standard testing alone. However, using ES as a first- or second-tier \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 9  \ntest (e.g., after CMA or targeted testing) yielded more diagnoses at a lower cost than using ES \nonly after extensive standard testing (e.g., large sequencing panels and/or multiple testing \napproaches) or using standard testing alone. With the anticipated further declines in cost, early \nuse of genome-wide sequencing should continue to enable more timely diagnosis for patients \nwith unexplained DD or multiple Cas.  \nWhole genome sequencing is costlier than more limited sequencing, because the whole \ngenome is equivalent to approximately 3.3 x 109 bases (3.3 gigabases [Gb]). Whole genome \nsequencing may become preferable to exome sequencing as cost decreases and more \ninformation about the role of non-coding DNA in human disease becomes available. Further, \nwhole genome sequencing can be used to detect deletions and duplications typically detected \nonly by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and thus is an opportunity to reduce \nthe need for other supplemental testing. One of the most common medical indications for whole \ngenome sequencing or whole exome sequencing is evaluation of severe intellectual disability or \ndevelopmental delay believed to have a genetic etiology in a child with a negative initial \nevaluation.   \nThe value of genetic counseling in exome and genome sequencing is well-established. Creating \nreasonable expectations, establishing an understanding of the value and limitations of testing, \ncreating awareness of the potential harms, and allowing the family to make informed choices is \na mainstay of informed consent for ES/GS. These visits should also be commensurate with the \ntime spent as part of the clinical process including reimbursement for this type of counseling. \nPost-test counseling extends this benefit once the results are available regardless of the \ndiagnostic yield. Elements of counseling should include a three-generation family pedigree; \ndiscussion of pathogenic/likely pathogenic results, benign results, and variants of uncertain \nsignificance; detection of misattributed paternity or consanguinity, and secondary findings \nunrelated to the reason for testing.  \nGenetic Associations with DD/ID and ASD \nFor common phenotypes and syndromes, the pathogenicity of CNVs may be supported by \nconsiderable evidence; for uncommon phenotypes and uncommon CNVs determining \npathogenicity requires a systematic evaluation that includes parental studies, examining \ndatabases for reported associations, and considering the molecular consequences of the \nidentified variant. Parental studies (e.g., “trio” testing of affected child, father, and mother) can \nidentify an inherited CNV from an unaffected parent and therefore considered benign. A variety \nof databases index the clinical implications of CNVs and their associations with a particular \nphenotype. CNVs are continuously cataloged and, with growth in CMA testing and improved \nresolution, databases have become increasingly extensive (e.g., DECIPHER, ClinVar).  For \nuncommon CNVs, in addition to reports of CNV-phenotype associations, the location and size of \nthe CNV can offer clues to pathogenicity; larger CNVs are more often pathogenic and the role of \naffected genes in brain circuitry and effect of CNV on gene expression can implicate \npathogenicity. Although uncommon, an observed phenotype can result from unmasking a \nmutated recessive allele on the unaffected (non-CNV) chromosome. Other considerations when \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 10  \ndetermining pathogenicity include CNV dosage, X linkage, number of reports in the literature of \nan association between CNV and phenotype, and findings in “normal” individuals.  \nThe American College of Medical Genetics has published guidelines for evaluating, interpreting, \nand reporting pathogenicity reflecting these principles. The recommended categories of clinical \nsignificance for reporting are pathogenic, uncertain clinical significance (likely pathogenic, likely \nbenign, or no subclassification), or benign. The International Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays \nConsortium more recently proposed “an evidence-based approach to guide the development of \ncontent on chromosomal microarrays and to support interpretation of clinically significant copy \nnumber variation.” The proposal defined levels of evidence describe how well or how poorly \ndetected variants or CNVs correlate with phenotype. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments. Lab tests for CMA testing and NGS are available under \nthe auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that offer \nlaboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement \nAmendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \nhas chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \nIn 2010, FDA indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell \ntheir products for use in clinical cytogenetics. \nCMA Testing \nCMA testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and \nwhole- genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray analysis. \nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan® Dx Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by \nFDA through the de novo 510(k) process. FDA’s review of the CytoScan® Dx Assay included an \nanalytic evaluation of the test’s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of \ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test \nmethods. The FDA found that the CytoScan® Dx Assay could detect CNVs across the genome \nand adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with ID/DD. Reproducibility \ndecreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately four \nhundred kilobases (generally recommended as the lower reporting limit). As of July 2017, \nAffymetrix ™ has reported 2.7 million markers for copy number, 750,000 SNVs and 1.9 million \npolymorphic probes (Affymetrix ™ was acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific in 2016). FDA \nproduct code: PFX. \nFirstStepDx PLUS® (Lineagen) uses Lineagen’s custom-designed microarray platform \nmanufactured by Affymetrix. As of July 2017, this microarray consists of a 2.8 million probe \nmicroarray for the detection of CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. The array \nincludes probes that come standard on the Affymetrix CytoScan HD® microarray, with an \nadditional 88,435 custom probes designed by Lineagen . \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 11  \nAmbry Genetics offers multiple tests (CMA and NGS) designed for diagnosing ASD and \nneurodevelopmental disorders.

RATIONALE          TOP \n \nSummary of Evidence \nFor individuals who have DD/ID, ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-\ndelineated genetic syndrome who receive CMA testing, the evidence includes primarily case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, changes in reproductive decision \nmaking, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity. \nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA on patient outcomes are lacking, the \nimprovement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been well-demonstrated. Direct evidence \nof improved outcomes with CMA compared with karyotyping is lacking. However, for at least a \nsubset of the disorders potentially diagnosed with CMA testing in this patient population, there \nare well-defined and accepted management steps associated with positive test results. Further, \nthere is evidence of changes in reproductive decision making as a result of positive test results. \nThe information derived from CMA testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long \ndiagnostic odyssey; or reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating \nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities; or it could potentially impact future \nreproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the \ntechnology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \nFor exome and genome sequencing, the growing body of literature provides justification for a \nstrong recommendation based desirable effects and limited harms. The evidence is sufficient to \ndetermine that the technology results in meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \nFor individuals who have DD/ID, ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-\ndelineated genetic syndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the \nevidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 12  \nchanges in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The \ndiagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing panel testing in this patient \npopulation is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of uncertain results are \nvariable, based on gene panel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally, there are risks \nof uninterpretable and incidental results.

Each spot on an array is \nassociated with a particular gene. Each color in an array represents either healthy (control) or \ndiseased (sample) tissue. Depending on the type of array used, the location and intensity of a \ncolor will indicate whether the gene, or mutation, is present in either the control and/or sample \nDNA. It will also provide an estimate of the expression level of the gene(s) in the sample and \ncontrol DNA. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY /INTELLECTUAL \nDISABILITY , AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER , AND CONGENITAL ANOMALIES  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.242 \n \nEffective: 1/1/2025                 13  \nMITOCHONDRIA are intracellular organelles that are responsible for energy production and \ncellular respiration. \nMITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE refers to one of hundreds of congenital illnesses that result from \nmutations in mitochondrial DNA.

Policy Description  \n \nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is the strategy of using next -generation technology to sequence the \nentire genome. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) refers to sequencing of the exome, the component of \nthe genome that predominantly encode proteins. Next generation  sequencing (NGS) involves \nsequencing of multiple small fragments of DNA in parallel, producing fast, accurate sequencing results \n(Hulick, 2024).  \n \nThis policy is applicable for undiagnosed rare germline disorders.  \n \nII. Indications and/or Limitations of Coverage  \n \nApplication of coverage criteria is dependent upon an individual’s benefit coverage at the time of the \nrequest. Specifications pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid can be found in the “Applicable State and \nFederal Regulations” section of this policy documen t. \n \n1) For the evaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in individuals less \nthan 18 years of age , whole exome sequencing (WES) and comparator analysis (e.g., \nparents/siblings) WES MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA when all of the following criteria are met:  \n \na) When the individual has been evaluated by an ABMGG  board -certified medical geneticist or an \nABGC board -certified genetic counselor (CGC)  and has been counseled about the potential risks \nof genetic testing;  \nb) When the WES results will impact patient management and clinical outcome for the individual \nbeing tested;  \nc) When a genomic  etiology is the most likely explanation for the phenotype;  \nd) When no other causative circumstances (e.g., environmental exposures, injury, infection) can \nexplain the symptoms;  \ne) When the clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single -gene or \ntargeted panel testing (e.g., comparative genomic hybridization/chromosomal microarray \nanalysis) is available;  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 2 of 25 \n \nf) When the differential diagnosis list and/or phenotype warrant testing of multiple genes and \none of the following:  \n \ni) WES is more practical than the separate single gene tests or panels that would be \nrecommended based on the differential diagnosis.  \nii) WES results may preclude the need for multiple and/or invasive procedures, follow -up, or \nscreening that would be recommended in the absence of testing.  \n \n2) For a fetus with ultrasound anomalies, WES and comparator analysis (e.g., parents/siblings) WES \nMEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA  when all of the following criteria are met:  \n \na) When pre -test counseling has been provided by an ABMGG  board -certified medical geneticist \nor an ABGC board -certified genetic counselor (CGC) ; \nb) When standard chromosomal microarray testing (CMA) and karyotype analysis have failed to \nyield a definitive diagnosis;  \nc) When a genomic  etiology is the most likely explanation for the phenotype;  \nd) When no other causative circumstances (e.g., environmental exposures, injury, infection) can \nexplain the symptoms;  \ne) When clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single -gene or \ntargeted panel testing is available. If a specific diagnosis is suspected, molecular testing for the \nsuggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) should be the initial test.  \n \n3) Reanalysis of exome sequencing (ES) data with WES and comparator analysis (e.g., parents/siblings) \nWES MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA  for any of the following situations : \n \na) For individuals less than 18 years of age  with initial negative ES results as an aid in clinical \ndiagnosis when additional phenotypic findings are noted during a child’s growth and \ndevelopment.  \nb) For diagnostic results and results deemed to be possibly (but not definitively) associated with \nthe fetal phenotype (new gene -disease associations might have been unknown at the time of \ninitial diagnosis).  \nc) For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, if a new phenotype develops in the proband \nafter birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant amount of time has passed (at least \n12 months) since the initial testing was performed.  \nd) If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time . \n \n4) When WES is unable to identify a causative mutation and the clinical suspicion of a genomic etiology \nremains in situations where any of the above criteria are met in their entirety, whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA.  \n \nThe following does not meet coverage criteria due to a lack of available published scientific literature \nconfirming that the test(s) is/are required and beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment of an \nindividual’s illness.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 3 of 25 \n \n \n5) If WES has been previously performed, further genetic tests involving only exome analyses DO NOT \nMEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \n6) Focused exome sequencing and targeted WGS DO NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA.  \n7) For all other situations not described above, WES DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \n8) Combination testing of WES with intronic variants testing, regulatory variants testing, and/or \nmitochondrial genome testing, sometimes referred to as whole exome plus testing (e.g., Genomic \nUnity ® Exome Plus Analysis), DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA .  \n9) For all other situations  not described above, WGS  DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \nIII.

Scientific Background   \nDNA sequencing is a critical tool for the evaluation of many medical conditions. The two primary \nmethods of DNA sequencing in the clinical setting are Sanger sequencing and next -generation \nsequencing or NGS. NGS is a technique that allows for the rapid seq uencing of multiple strands of DNA. \nIt is not limited to one specific type of test; rather it encompasses numerous technologies that produce \nswift and high -volume sequencing. NGS can be used to sequence larger sequences, such as the exome \nor the entire gen ome. This is opposed to the traditional Sanger sequencing, which is more useful for \nsequencing a specific gene (Hulick, 2024) . \nThe NGS procedure typically includes the following steps: first the patient’s DNA is prepared to serve as \na template, then DNA fragments are isolated (on solid surfaces such as small beads) where sequence \ndata is generated. Then these results are compared against a reference genome. Any DNA sample may \nbe used if the quality and quantity of that sample is sufficient, but the methods of library generation and \ndata analysis often vary from panel to panel. Evaluating the results of a gene panel typically requir es \nexpertise in bioinformatics. Since NGS reports data on any variants found, great care must be taken to \nevaluate these gene variants, especially variants of unknown significance (VUS) and secondary findings \n(Hulick, 2024; Rehm et al., 2013) .  \nExome and genome sequencing are usually performed with NGS. The exome represents all the protein -\nencoding genes, and at least 85% of pathogenic mutations are found in the exome. Further, the exome \nonly comprises approximately 1.5% -2% of the genome, thereby  making it more cost effective to \nsequence than whole genome sequencing. The entire exome includes approximately 30 megabases \ncompared to the genome’s 3.3 gigabases. However, sequencing an entire genome may be useful as a \npathogenic mutation may be in a no ncoding region of the genome, such as gene regulation dysfunction. \nMost clinical NGS testing uses targeted panels or whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) is only used in select cases. For instance, conditions such as nonsyndromic  hearing \nloss (possible pathogenic variants in over 60 genes) may benefit from WES evaluation (Hulick, 2024) .  \nSeveral companies have pivoted towards focused exome sequencing. These are panels tailored to \nindividual phenotypes and target a maximum number of genes depending on the company. There is a \n>30% diagnostic yield, with freedom for clinicians to choose speci fic genes they are interested in, with \nreduced cost and options to reflex to WES for negative cases (GGC, 2022) . In their study, Jia et al. (2023)  \nretrospectively analyzed 372 pediatric patients who were referred to clinically focused exome \nsequencing (CFES), and concluded that CFES may be first -line for “diagnosing young children with \nsuspected genetic conditions, as it validates the identification  of molecular genetics alterations and \nfacilitates comprehensive medical management. The patients that were more likely to receive diagnoses \nvia CFES were those with “metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities, craniofacial /otolaryngology/ \nophthalmologic abnorm alities, and/or [abnormalities of] the integument” (Jia et al., 2023) . Despite the \nnovelty and expected benefits of focused exome sequencing, more clinical studies with larger sample \nsizes are necessary.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 8 of 25 \n \nProprietary Testing  \nMany proprietary technologies for WES and WGS are available. Companies such as Variantyx provide \nhighly specialized genetic testing to patients and clinicians. The Genomic Unity® Exome Plus Analysis test \nsequences the exome, including intronic and regulato ry variants, identifies disease causing deletions or \nduplications in the genome, and analyzes the mitochondrial genome with heteroplasmy (≥5%). This test \nmay identify many genes for a variety of disorders including AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, \nATXN8OS, ATXN10, C9ORF72, CACNA1A, CNBP, CSTB, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, JPH3, NOP56, \nNOTCH2NLC, PABPN1, PPP2R2B, TBP  (for adult -onset movement disorders), AFF2, DIP2B, FMR1  (for \nearly -onset intellectual disability disorders), and PHOX2B, TCF4  (for other disorders) (variantyx, 2020) . \nThis test requires either a blood, saliva or gDNA (genomic DNA) sample and has an eight -week \nturnaround time.  \nClinical Utility and Validity  \nAlfares et al. (2018)  compared the cost -effectiveness and clinical utility of both WES and WGS. Data was \nanalyzed from 108 participants; all 108 individuals had negative array comparative genomic \nhybridization (also known as chromosomal microarray) results and negative or inco nclusive WES results \nbefore WGS was performed. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is another common genetic testing \nmethod that can analyze many pieces of DNA simultaneously. The authors only pinpointed three positive \ncases where WGS identified a genetic or inhe rited disorder that WES did not recognize; further, it was \nnoted that “30% of the positive cases identified by WGS could be identified by reanalyzing the WES raw \ndata, and WGS achieved an only 7% higher detection rate. Therefore, until the cost of WGS appr oximates \nthat of WES, reanalyzing WES raw data is recommended before performing WGS” (Alfares et al., 2018) . \nYang et al. (2014)  conducted a single -center observational study of 2000 patients with clinical whole \nexome sequencing performed for a suspected genetic disorder. A molecular diagnosis was reported for \n504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously  reported. The investigators \nconcluded that “the yield of whole -exome sequencing may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients” (Yang et al., 2014) . Best et al. (2018)  reviewed 31 different \nWES studies and noted that the diagnostic rates varied between 6.2% and 80%; however, the \nresearchers state that the “differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to \nsequencing largely account for the wide r ange of diagnostic rates.”  \nTammimies et al. (2015)  evaluated the molecular diagnostic yield of CMA and WES in children with \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD). The patient cohort included 258 consecutively enrolled unrelated \nchildren with ASD, stratified into three groups based on the presence of major congen ital abnormalities \nand minor physical anomalies. All probands underwent CMA, with WES performed for 95 proband -\nparent trios. The molecular diagnostic yields of CMA and WES were comparable. Among the 95 patients \nundergoing WES, eight  children (8.4%)  received an ASD -related molecular diagnosis. Among the children \nwho underwent both CMA and WES testing, the estimated proportion with an identifiable genetic \netiology was 15.8%. The investigators concluded that “if replicated in additional  populations, these \nfindings may inform appropriate selection of molecular diagnostic testing for children affected by ASD” \n(Tammimies et al., 2015) . A similar study was performed by Arteche -López et al. (2021)  to validate WES \nas a “first -tier test for the genetic diagnosis of [ASD], when there is no suspicion of fragile X syndrome.” \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 9 of 25 \n \nUpon comparing the clinical utility of CMA, FMR1  testing, and WES testing, the researchers “achieved a \nglobal diagnostic rate of 12.8% (44/343), the majority of them being characterised by WES (33/44; 75%) \ncompared to CMA (9/44; 20.4%) or  FMR1  testing (2/44; 4.5%),” evidently demonstrating the “higher \ndiagnostic power” of WES compared to CMA (Arteche -López et al., 2021) . \nTaylor et al. (2015)  performed whole genome sequencing in 217 individuals across a broad spectrum of \ngenetic disorders in whom previous screening had identified no pathogenic variants. Disease -causing \nvariants were identified in 21% of cases, with the proportion increasing to  34% (23/68) for mendelian \ndisorders and 57% (8/14) in family trios. The investigators concluded that the results “demonstrate the \nvalue of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding \nchallenges” (Taylor et al., 2015) . \nMiller et al. (2017)  performed exome/whole genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause in patients \nwith craniosynostosis, in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative. Out of the 40 \npatients’ tests, associated mutations were identified in 15 patients (37.5%) involving 14 different genes. \nIn five of the 15 positive cases, the molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences in \npatient management. The investigators concluded that “the benefits of exome/whole genome \nsequencing to identify causal  mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has \nyielded negative results” (Miller et al., 2017) . \nCrowley et al. (2020)  used WES in a single -center cohort study of 1005 pediatric IBD patients and found \na 3% prevalence of damaging variants in genes linked to monogenic IBD, and that 1% of monogenic \npediatric IBD patients have variants in genes associated with primary immunod eficiency that are \npotentially curable through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As rare genetic variants \ncould manifest in different phenotypes, the researchers believe that the “data supports the diagnosis of \nmonogenic disease beyond th e very early onset IBD population especially in children with a family \nhistory of autoimmune diseases and those with evidence of extra -intestinal manifestations of IBD” and \nthat WES will lend itself to provide definitive and personalized treatments in the future (Crowley et al., \n2020) . \nSrivastava et al. (2014)  conducted a retrospective cohort study on 78 children with neurodevelopmental \ndisabilities and a prior unrevealing workup before WES. The overall presumptive diagnostic testing rate \nwas 41% (32/78 patients). Results of WES affected patient management in a ll cases, most often related \nto reproductive planning (27/78). The investigators concluded that the high diagnostic yield of WES \ncould lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning \n(Srivastava et al., 2014) . \nHaskell et al. (2018)  studied the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in the evaluation of \nneuromuscular disorders. A total of 93 undiagnosed patients with potential neuromuscular disorders \nparticipated in this study; the diagnostic yield of these 93 patients with exome seq uencing was 12.9% \n“with one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in a causative gene associated with \nthe patient's disorder” (Haskell et al., 2018) . In this study, exome sequencing was able to provide or \nclarify a neuromuscular disorder diagnosis, but only in a small percentage of the population studied.  \nInvolving WGS or WES as a supplemental level of evaluation has been able to effect change in medical \ncare and treatment pathways. In the NIH -funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, among 382 patients \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 10 of 25 \n \nwith complete evaluations, “28 (21%) of the patients who received a diagnosis, the diagnosis led to a \nrecommendation regarding a change in therapy. In 49 (37%), the diagnosis led to a change in care other \nthan therapy, such as the narrowing of diagnostic t esting. In 48 (36%), the diagnosis led to variant -\nspecific genetic counseling but did not lead to a change in the diagnostic or therapeutic strategy.” The \nchanges in therapy ranged from known drugs, vitamins, coenzyme supplementations, and transplant in \none patient. This demonstrated evidence supporting usage of DNA sequencing for genetically \ndetermined conditions and a representative lens of how it can affect medical care (Splinter et al., 2018) . \nMuthaffar (2021)  conducted a retrospective chart review for WES results between January 2018 to \nNovember 2019 for patients at a pediatric neurology clinic in Saudi Arabia to identify the utility of WES. \nIt was found that “twenty -six children with undiagnosed neurological conditions were identified and \nunderwent WES diagnosis. Nineteen patients (73.0%) of the cohort were diagnosed with pathogenic \nvariants, likely pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS).” The researcher also \nfurthered the conclusions of  the WES high diagnostic rate by proving direct implications on clinical \nmanagement based on testing results. One patient who had a positive pathogenic BTD mutation, \ndiagnosed at seven -years old with a biotinidase deficiency, was started on biotin supplements after WES \ntesting, and was able to breathe independently off a ventilator, regain motor capabilities with physical \ntherapy, improve hearing, and elimin ate convulsions (Muthaffar, 2021) . \nUsing WES on eleven probands from ten Jordanian families who have been formerly diagnosed with \nlimb -girdle dystrophy (LGMD) and Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT), Ababneh et al. (2021)  identified \na series of missense, nonsense, and deletion variants associated with neuromuscular disorders. \nConsequently, the researchers argue that “Utilization of WES is helpful to facilitate rapid and accurate \nNMDs diagnosis, complementing a thorough cli nical evaluation”, especially in a country where the risk \nof autosomal -recessive disorders is increased by consanguinity and the implementation of genetic \ndiagnosis is limited and the results misunderstood (Ababneh et al., 2021) .  \nSanford et al. (2019)  investigated the clinical utility of rWGS in children within the pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU). They were able to make a molecular diagnosis by rWGS in 17 of 38 children, and in four \nof the 17 children diagnosed by rWGS (24%), “the genetic diagnose s led to a change in management \nwhile in the PICU, including genome -informed changes in pharmacotherapy and transition to palliative \ncare… Eighty -two percent of diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient and/or family \nafter PICU discharge, i ncluding avoidance of biopsy, administration of factor replacement, and \nsurveillance for disorder -related sequelae” (Sanford et al., 2019) . In this retrospective analysis, benefits \nof rWGS were further elucidated in the setting of unknown or unclear clinical etiologies.  \nReda et al. (2020)  studied WES for metastatic solid cancer diagnoses in 506 patients. In this study, the \nsomatic and germline exome analysis was restricted to 317 specific genes. Exome sequencing was \nsuccessful in 386 tumor samples, and 342 patients received a therapeutic p roposal based on their \ngenetic results. However, only 79 patients were treated with an NGS matched therapy. While this study \nshows that WES is a possible tool to assist with metastatic solid cancer diagnoses and treatments, “no \ndifferences were observed be tween PFS [progression -free survival] ratios of patients treated with \nmatched therapy versus standard therapy” (Reda et al., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 11 of 25 \n \nOther studies have also yielded bifurcating results on the periodic revisiting of unsolved exome cases \nand for variants of unknown significance. Salfati et al. (2019)  found that re -analysis of 101 WES cases \none to seven  years after initial analysis resulted in “the identification of additional diagnostic variants in \n3 rare disease cases (5.9%) and 1 sudden unexplained death case (2%), which increased our molecular \ndiagnostic yield to 31.4% and 12%, respectively.” However,  though they recognize the importance of \nany diagnostic yield to those families potentially affected, the authors also acknowledge that “most of \nour cases remain unexplained after our re -analysis”, which they attribute to an enduring lack of coverage \nof functional exonic variants, along with “the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease that is not \neasily dissected in small families, and the possibility of disease due to epigenetic, somatic, or other \nuninterrogated genomic aberrations.” As such, “We [ the authors] suggest that a 6 -month cycle of \nautomated re -analysis could improve the pace at which new findings are disseminated to patients. \nPeriodic re -analysis by third party or other software not originally used to analyze cases is also \npotentially use ful to uncover pathogenic variants that may be missed by the differences across genome \ninterpretation platforms” (Salfati et al., 2019) .  \nParent -child Trio Testing  \nParent -child trio testing is a strategy which helps to identify single pathogenic mutations among the \nmany genomic variants in an individual. Specifically, the sequencing of both the parents and the patient \nallows for the variant to be identified easier an d “filtered based on consistency or inconsistency \naccording to the laws of Mendelian inheritance” (Sakai et al., 2013) . \nLee et al. (2014)  reported on the initial clinical indications for clinical exome sequencing (CES) referrals \nand molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and different test types. CES was performed on \n814 patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions who underwent WES. CES was conducted \nusing a trio -CES technique which involves  both parents and their affected child sequenced \nsimultaneously. Overall, a molecular diagnosis with a causative variant in a well -established clinical gene \nwas provided for 213/ 814 (26%) cases. The trio -CES was associated with a higher molecular diagnostic \nyield (31%; 127/410 cases) than proband -CES or traditional molecular diagnostic methods. The \ninvestigators concluded that “additional studies designed to validate these finding s and to explore the \neffect of this approach on clinical and economic outcomes are warranted” (Lee et al., 2014) . \nSoden et al. (2014)  performed diagnostic WGS and/or WES in parent -child trios for 100 families with 119 \nchildren with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A total of 45% of the families received molecular \ndiagnoses of an established genetic disorder (53/119 affected children) . An accelerated sequencing \nmodality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families with acutely ill children (11/15). In this study, \nWES proved to be less costly than continued conventional diagnostic testing of children with NDD in \nwhom initial testing  failed to yield a diagnosis. The investigators concluded that “initial diagnostic \nevaluation of children with NDD should include trio WGS or WES, with extension of accelerated \nsequencing modalities to high -acuity patients” (Soden et al., 2014) . \nAnother study compared fetal WES versus trio analysis WES on fetuses with sonographic abnormalities. \nThe researchers found that trio analysis yielded a positive/definitive diagnosis in 30% (3/10) of the cases \nas compared to only 14.3% (2/14) of the singlet on cases. They conclude, “In order to expedite \ninterpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 12 of 25 \n \ncompromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes” (Drury et al., 2015) . Similarly, these data are \nsupported by another study of trio analysis of thirty different cases. A total of 10% of the cases were \npositive for a pathogenic finding, and 17% were de novo, inherited recessive, or X -linked variants. The \nauthors conclude, “T his study outlines the way for a substantial improvement in the diagnostic yield of \nprenatal genetic abnormalities through the application of next -generation sequencing” (Carss et al., \n2014) . \nYates et al. (2017)  performed WES, including trio analysis, using samples obtained from deceased fetuses \nwith ultrasound anomalies. They note that 20% of cases were positive overall with a definitive diagnosis \nwith another 45% positive for possible pathogenic candidate varia nts. Comparing trio analysis to \nsingleton analysis, 24% (n=11) of trio analysis resulted in a definitive diagnostic finding versus 14% (n=3) \nfor singleton testing (Yates et al., 2017) .  \nClark et al. (2018)  compared the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and CMA in children with \nsuspected genetic disorders. Trio analyses were also analyzed. Many studies were reviewed in this meta -\nanalysis; the authors state that “In 37 studies, comprising 20,068 chi ldren, diagnostic utility of WGS \n(0.41, 95% CI 0.34 -0.48, I2 = 44%) and WES (0.36, 95% CI 0.33 -0.40, I2 = 83%) were qualitatively greater \nthan CMA (0.10, 95% CI 0.08 -0.12, I2 = 81%) (Clark et al., 2018) . Further, a statistical difference was not \nfound regarding the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS. Finally, “Subgroups with higher WGS/WES \ndiagnostic utility were trios and those receiving hospital -based interpretation. WGS/WES should be \nconsidered a first -line genomic test for children with suspected genetic diseases” (Clark et al., 2018) . \nZhang et al. (2021)  performed WES and trio analysis on 18 unrelated men who have idiopathic \nhypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), which is a rare genetic disorder that causes delayed or absent \npuberty as well as infertility due to gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) insuffi ciency/deficiency, \nand their parents. With this testing, “one reported and 10 novel variants in eight known IHH causative \ngenes ( AXL, CCDC141, CHD7, DMXL2, FGFR1, PNPLA6, POLR3A, and PROKR2 ), nine variants in nine \nrecently reported candidate genes ( DCAF17,  DCC, EGF, IGSF10, NOTCH1, PDE3A, RELN, SLIT2, and \nTRAPPC9 ), and four variants in four novel candidate genes for IHH ( CCDC88C, CDON, GADL1,  and \nSPRED3 ) were identified in 77.8% (14/18) of IHH cases.” This analysis also supported oligogenic etiology \nfor disease presentation, with 44.4% cases carrying at least two variants in IHH -related genes. They also \nfound that the variants “tended to be maternally in herited (maternal with n = 17 vs paternal with n = 7; \nP = 0.028),” which was confirmed by their previous l iterature review, and due to the presence of female \ncarriers, extends the notion that females may be more tolerant of “deleterious” IHH -related gene \nmutations. This study exemplifies the clinical utility of WES and trio analysis for reproductive genetic \ndisorders and could be used to continue pedigree analyses for IHH (Zhang et al., 2021) . \nMalcher et al. (2022)  investigated the use of whole -genome sequencing in identifying new candidate \ngenes for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). The authors applied WGS for 39 patients with NOA to \nidentify novel NOA -associated SNVs, yielding “8 potentially disease causing [sic] variants in 4 genes, \nfollowed by 30 variants in 20 genes that were previously linked to infertility, and 20 variants in 13 genes \nthat have never been investigated with respect to male infertility but could be important in patients \nwith NOA” in 29 of the 3 9 azoospermic individuals. Of these 58 variants, 16 were newly discovered and, \nas such, “highly recommended to examine their possible function and mechanism of participation in \ngametogenesis” (Malcher et al., 2022) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 13 of 25 \n \nIn their examination of whole exome and genome sequencing in a Mendelian disorder cohort, Ewans et \nal. (2022)  determined that “WGS resulted in a diagnosis in one third (34%; 13/38 families) of \nundiagnosed families who had previously had WES.” However, when adjusting for “factors such as \nimprovements to gene -disease knowledge and genomic pipelines through contempo rary WES \nreanalysis, the WGS diagnostic yield reduced to 19% (6/31 remaining families)”, primarily due to “due \nto reduced WES coverage of critical regions that may be solved through an improved WES platform.” \nSuch results contribute to the debate about the  “trade -off between the lower cost of WES and the higher \ndiagnostic yield of WGS” and will ultimately be a function of “the clinical scenario and local resourcing \nand availability” (Ewans et al., 2022) . \nV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)  \nIn 2012, the ACMG released a policy statement outlining points to consider in the clinical application of \ngenomic sequencing to the detection of germ -line mutations. The ACMG recommended that WGS/WES \nshould be considered in the clinical diagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:  \n• “The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but the phenotype \ndoes not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic test targeting a specific gene is \navailable on a clinical basis.”  \n• “A patient presents with a defined genetic disorder that demonstrates a high degree of genetic \nheterogeneity, making WES or WGS analysis of multiple genes simultaneously a more practical \napproach.”  \n• “A patient presents with a likely genetic disorder, but specific genetic tests available for that \nphenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \n• “A fetus with a likely genetic disorder in which specific genetic tests, including targeted \nsequencing tests, available for that phenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \nACMG stated that “WGS/WES may be considered in preconception carrier screening, using a strategy to \nfocus on genetic variants known to be associated with significant phenotypes in homozygous or \nhemizygous progeny.” ACMG further stated that WGS and WES shou ld not be used at this time as an \napproach to prenatal screening or as a first -tier approach for newborn screening (ACMG, 2012) . \nACMG released a guideline on informed consent for genome/exome sequencing. In that guideline, they \nnoted that WGS/WES was not recommended “before the legal age of majority” unless for “phenotype -\ndriven clinical diagnostic uses or circumstances in which ear ly monitoring or interventions are available \nand effective” (ACMG, 2013) . \nIn 2014 the ACMG published guidelines (Alford et al., 2014)  for the clinical evaluation and etiologic \ndiagnosis of hearing loss which state: “Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's \ninformed consent, genetic testing, if available, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis —this testing \nmay include single -gene tests, hearing loss  sequencing  panels,  whole -exome  sequencing(WES),  whole -\ngenome  sequencing  (WGS), chromosome analysis, or microarray -based copy -number analysis, \ndepending on clinical findings.”  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 14 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG published guidelines on the use of fetal exome sequencing (ES) in prenatal diagnoses. \nThese guidelines are  below (Monaghan et al., 2020) : \nPretest Considerations  \n• “Exome sequencing may be considered for a fetus with ultrasound anomalies when standard CMA \nand karyotype analysis have failed to yield a definitive diagnosis. If a specific diagnosis is \nsuspected, molecular testing for the suggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) \nshould be the initial test. At the present time, there are no data supporting the clinical use for ES \nfor other reproductive indications, such as the identification of sonographic markers suggestive \nof aneuploidy or a history of re current unexplained pregnancy loss.  \n• Trio analysis consisting of the proband and both biological parents is preferred to singleton (fetus \nonly) or duo (fetus and one parent) analyses. Trio analysis consistently shows higher diagnostic \nyields compared with nontrio analysis. It allows for the i mmediate identification of de novo \nvariants, determination of phase for biallelic variants, and confirmation of carrier status in both \nparents when a homozygous variant is detected. For laboratories not requiring trio analysis for \nprenatal ES, all efforts should be made to determine inheritance of identified fetal variants with \ntargeted testing of the biological parents. There may be circumstances where both biological \nparents are unable to submit specimens. In this scenario, variant segregation testing usi ng the \navailable parent or testing of other closely related family members should be considered.  \n• Pretest counseling is ideally provided by a genetics  professional during which the types of variants \nthat may be returned in a laboratory report for all tested family members would be reviewed.  \nPosttest Considerations  \n• Post -test counseling is recommended, regardless of the test result. It should be provided by \nindividuals with relevant expertise, preferably a genetics professional.  \nReanalysis Considerations  \n• For patients with initial negative ES results, reanalysis of exome sequencing data aids clinical \ndiagnosis after 12 months. This outcome has been validated in the pediatric population as \nadditional phenotypic findings might be noted during a child’s growth  and development. \nContinuous updates in database resources and new publications may provide further information \nfor variant and gene classification.  \n• Due to the discovery of new gene –disease associations (that were unknown at the time of initial \nanalysis), reanalysis can also be considered for diagnostic results and results deemed to be \npossibly (but not definitively) associated with the fetal phenotype . \n• For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, reanalysis may be considered if a new \nphenotype develops in the proband after birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant \namount of time has passed (either at the discretion of the testing lab oratory or at least 12 months) \nsince the initial testing was performed.  \n• If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time, a reanalysis could be considered” (Monaghan et \nal., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 15 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG conducted a systematic evidence review to support guideline development for the \nuse of exome and genome sequencing among patients with congenital anomalies, developmental delay, \nor intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). From their review, the  ACMG concluded, “There is evidence that \nES/GS for patients with CA/ DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision -making, which could lead \nto improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate \nevidence regar ding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients \nwith CA/DD/ID” (Malinowski et al., 2020) . \nIn 2021 the ACMG asserted that as the body of literature surrounding this continues to burgeon, it urges \nthem to “strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second -tier test (guided by clinical judgment \nand often clinician –patient/family shared decisi on making after CMA or focused testing) for patients \nwith one or more CAs prior to one year of age or for patients with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage” (Manickam et al., 2021) .  \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal and Fetal \nMedicine (SFM)  \nIn 2016 the ACOG and SFM published a joint committee opinion on “ Microarrays and Next -Generation \nSequencing Technology: The Use of Advanced Genetic Diagnostic Tools in Obstetrics and Gynecology”, \nwhich states that “the routine use of whole -genome or whole -exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis \nis not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer reviewed data and \nvalidation studies are published” (ACOG & SFM, 2016) .  \nHowever, ACOG and SFM note that WES may be considered when “specific genetic tests available for a \nphenotype, including targeted sequencing tests, have failed to determine a diagnosis in a fetus with \nmultiple congenital anomalies suggestive of a genetic di sorder.” The guideline further clarifies that “in \nselect circumstances (recurrent or lethal fetal anomalies in which other approaches have been \nnoninformative), [WES] may be considered as a diagnostic tool, but only after other appropriate testing \nhas been  noninformative and after extensive counseling by an [OB -GYN[ or other health care provider \nwith genetics expertise who is familiar with these new technologies and their limitations” (ACOG & SFM, \n2016) . This committee opinion was reaffirmed in 2023.  \nJoint Position Statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD), the Society for \nMaternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF)  \nPer the guideline, the word “sequencing” is used to refer to “whole exome sequencing, targeted analysis \nusing clinical panels, and whole genome sequencing.”  \n“The use of diagnostic sequencing is currently being introduced for evaluation of fetuses for whom \nstandard diagnostic genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), has already been \nperformed and is uninformative or is offered concurrentl y according to accepted practice guidelines, or \nfor whom expert genetic opinion determines that standard genetic testing is less optimal than \nsequencing for the presenting fetal phenotype” (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nRoutine use of prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot be supported due to “insufficient” \nvalidation and data about benefits and pitfalls (ISPD et al., 2018) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 16 of 25 \n \nWithin the section on recommendations for all diagnostic applications of genome -wide sequencing, \nconcerning trio analysis, they state, “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio \nanalysis, where fetal and both parental samples are s equenced and analyzed together. The trio approach \ncurrently benefits timeliness of result interpretation and aids assignment of pathogenicity for detected \nsequence variants. If proband‐only sequencing is performed, validation of diagnostic or potentially \ndiagnostic findings best includes a determination of inheritance through targeted testing of samples \nfrom biological parents” (ISPD et al., 2018) . However, the guideline could not recommend one \nsequencing method over another, nor was the guideline certain on the best way to interpret variants \nfound in genome -wide sequencing.  \nThe guideline provides three scenarios in which fetal sequencing may be “beneficial”:  \n“A current pregnancy with a fetus with a single major anomaly or with multiple organ system anomalies \nthat are suggestive of a possible genetic etiology, but no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA; or in \nselect situations with no CMA result, following a multidisciplinary review and consensus, in which there \nis a fetus with a multiple anomaly ‘pattern’ that strongly suggests a single gene disorder.”  \n“A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with a major \nsingle anomaly or multiple anomalies suggestive of a genetic etiology, and a recurrence of similar \nanomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic  diagnosis after karyotype or CMA. In addition, \nwhen such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected \nproband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it is considered appropriate \nto of fer sequencing for both biological parents to look for shared carrier status for autosomal recessive \nmutations that might explain the fetal phenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a \nprevious abnormal fetus or child for exome sequencing is  preferable.”  \n“In families with a history of recurrent stillbirths of unknown etiology after karyotype and/or CMA, \nwhere the fetus in the current pregnancy has a recurrent pattern of anomalies (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD released an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for \nprenatal diagnosis. Below are the pertinent recommendations:  \n• “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio analysis, where fetal and both \nparental samples are sequenced and analyzed together.”  \n• “Approaches to sequence analysis may vary from examination of genes known to be associated \nwith fetal or neonatal phenotypes to a broader genome -wide strategy. It is also uncertain whether \ninterpretation of variants found by genome -wide sequencing should f ollow the general guidelines \nfor interpretation and reporting of results for children and adults, or whether a more restrictive \napproach, limited to those variants that explain the phenotype is preferable in the prenatal \nsetting, or if a new approach restr icting reporting to severe childhood conditions should be \nconsidered.”  \n• “The current existing data support that prenatal sequencing is beneficial for the following \nindications:  \no A current pregnancy with a fetus having a major single anomaly or multiple organ anomalies:  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 17 of 25 \n \n▪ For which no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA and a clinical genetic expert review \nconsiders the phenotype suggestive of a possible genetic etiology.  \n▪ For which the multiple anomaly “pattern” strongly suggests a single gene disorder with \nno prior genetic testing. As pES is not currently validated to detect all CNVs, CMA should \nbe run before or in parallel with pES in this scenario.  \no A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with \na major single or multiple anomalies:  \n▪ With a recurrence of similar anomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic \ndiagnosis after karyotype or CMA for the current or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \n▪ When such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from \nthe affected proband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it \nis considered appropriate to offer sequencing for both biological parents to lo ok for \nshared carrier status for autosomal recessive mutations that might explain the fetal \nphenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a previous abnormal fetus or \nchild for pES is preferable.  \n• There is currently no evidence that supports routine testing (including upon parental request) on \nfetal tissue obtained from an invasive prenatal procedure (amniocentesis, CVS, cordocentesis, \nother) for indications other than fetal anomalies  \no There may be special settings when prenatal sequencing in the absence of a fetal phenotype \nvisible on prenatal imaging can be considered, such as with a strong family history of a \nrecurrent childhood‐onset severe genetic condition with no prenatal phenotyp e in previous \nchildren for whom no genetic evaluation was done and is not possible. Such scenarios should \nbe reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team preferentially in the context of a research \nprotocol. If sequencing is done for this indication, it mu st be done as trio sequencing, using \nan appropriate analytical approach” (Van den Veyver et al., 2022) . \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Kang et al., 2015)  on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management \nof congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) which state: “In individuals with CMD who either do not have \na mutation identified in one of the commonly associated genes or have a phenotype whose genetic \norigins have n ot been well characterized, physicians might order whole -exome or whole -genome \nsequencing when those technologies become more accessible and affordable for routine clinical use \n(Level C).”  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Narayanaswami et al., 2014)  on the diagnosis and treatment of \nlimb -girdle and distal dystrophies which state: “In patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom \ninitial clinically directed genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic \nconsultation o r perform parallel  sequencing  of targeted exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -\ngenome screening, or next -generation  sequencing  to identify the genetic abnormality (Level C).”  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology (AMP)  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 18 of 25 \n \nThe AMP published a report on the spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing \nprocedures for inherited conditions and cancer. The background of this report states, “Whole genome \nsequencing is currently more expensive than WES, requires gr eater analysis, and generates more \nvariants of uncertain significance. WES is a plausible approach when the clinical picture cannot be \naffirmed using a specific gene panel. As technologies and understanding of variants advance, whole \ngenome sequencing migh t become the test of choice” (Joseph et al., 2016) . \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  \nAAP published guidelines on the evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorder. According to the \nguidelines, CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. Since Fragile \nX Syndrome increases the risk for autism spectrum  disorder, DNA testing for Fragile X should be \nrecommended in all children with ASD, especially for boys and children with a family history of \nintellectual disability. “The cytosine -guanine -guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion that is responsible \nfor fra gile X syndrome is not detected on CMA and must be ordered as a separate test. When the history \nand physical examination, CMA, and fragile X analysis do not identify an etiology, the next step at this \ntime in the etiologic evaluation for [autism spectrum d isorder] is whole -exome sequencing (WES).” AAP \ndoes not recommend the use of commercially marketed tests as they do not provide a molecular \netiologic diagnosis (Hyman et al., 2020) .  \nCanadian College of Medical Geneticists  \nIn 2015, the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists published a position statement on genome -wide \nsequencing for monogenic diseases. Their relevant recommendations include the following:  \n• “Recommendations for diagnostic assessment:  \no Clinical exome sequencing, at this time, should only be used to interrogate the genome for \nnucleotide sequence variants in genes known to cause disease. Clinical WGS may be used to \ndetect CNV and structural variation in addition to sequence variants, thoug h it is not currently \na first -tier test for such analyses.  \no Clinical genome -wide sequencing should be considered in the investigation of an affected \nindividual when his/her phenotype or family history suggests a monogenic aetiology in whom \nthe causal mutation(s) are unknown, and one or more of the following additio nal conditions \napply:  \n▪ the phenotype is associated with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity;  \n▪ specific genetic tests have failed to arrive at a diagnosis and testing of other clinically \nrelevant genes is appropriate;  \n▪ genome -wide sequencing is a more cost -effective approach than available individual gene \nor gene panel testing.”  \n• “Until the benefits of reporting incidental findings are established, we do not endorse the \nintentional clinical analysis of disease -associated genes other than those linked to the primary \nindication.”  \nBelow is a figure of a “decision aid to facilitate the diagnostic evaluation of patients with rare disease of \nsuspected monogenic aetiology” (Boycott et al., 2015) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 19 of 25 \n \n \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians  \nIn 2021, the Royal Austalasian  College of Physicians provided guidelines on pediatric genetic testing in \nthe context of intellectual disability (ID) and global developmental delay (GDD). For childhood \nsyndromes or ID/GDD, the group recommends WES or WGS as tests of choice, since they o ffer “a broad, \nagnostic screen,” but acknowledge that WES is more widely available and cost -effective at the time of \npublication. In terms of ordering singleton or trio testing, the group states that “the latter (trio) approach \nis highly recommended given it simplifies analysis… it is also a more streamlined clinical test as trio \ntesting identifies fewer variants of uncertain significance than singleton testing” (Sachdev et al., 2021) . \nVI. Applicable State and Federal Regulations  \n \nDISCLAIMER: If there is a conflict between this Policy and any relevant, applicable government policy \nfor a particular member [e.g., Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) or National Coverage \nDeterminations (NCDs) for Medicare and/or state coverage for Medi caid], then the government policy \nwill be used to make the determination.  For the most up -to-date Medicare policies and coverage, \nplease visit the  Medicare search website . For the most up -to-date Medicaid policies and coverage, visit \nthe applicable state Medicaid website.  \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)  \nGenotyping is considered a laboratory developed test (LDT); developed, validated, and performed by \nindividual laboratories. Additionally, many labs have developed specific tests that they must validate \nand perform in house. These laboratory -developed tests  (LDTs) are regulated by the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid (CMS) as high -complexity tests under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 20 of 25 \n \nAmendments of 1988 (CLIA ’88). LDTs are not approved or cleared by the U. S. Food and Drug \nAdministration; however, FDA clearance or approval is not currently required for clinical use.  \nVII. Important Reminder  \n \nThe purpose of this Medical Policy is to provide a guide to coverage. This Medical Policy is not \nintended to dictate to providers how to practice medicine. Nothing in this Medical Policy is intended \nto discourage or prohibit providing other medical advice or treatment deemed appropriate by the \ntreating physician.  \n \nBenefit determinations are subject to applicable member contract language. To the extent there are \nany conflicts between these guidelines and the contract language, the contract language will control.  \n \nThis Medical Policy has been developed through consideration of the medical necessity criteria under \nHawaii's Patients' Bill of Rights and Responsibilities Act (Hawaii Revised Statutes §432E -1.4) or for \nQUEST members, under Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR  1700.1 -42), generally accepted standards of \nmedical practice and review of medical literature and government approval status.  \n \nHMSA has determined that services not covered under this Medical Policy will not be medically \nnecessary under Hawaii law in most cases. If a treating physician disagrees with HMSA's determination \nas to medical necessity in a given case, the physician may r equest that HMSA reconsider the \napplication of the medical necessity criteria to the case at issue in light of any supporting \ndocumentation.  \n \nGenetic testing is covered for level 1 or 2A recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer \nNetwork (NCCN and in accordance with Hawaii’s Patients’ Bill of Rights and Responsibilities Act \n(Hawaii Revised Statutes §432E -1.4) or for QUEST members, the Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR \n1700.1 -42). \n \nVIII.

Results of testing with ES include known pathogenic variants\ndefinitely associated with disease or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).13,14 \nPathogenic variants that can be identified by ES include missense, nonsense, \nsplice-site, and small deletions or insertions.\nAt the present time, ES can fail to detect certain classes of disease-causing \nvariants, such as structural variants (e.g., translocations, inversions), abnormal \nchromosome imprinting or methylation, some mid-size insertions and deletions (ca. \n10-500 bp), trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations, deeper intronic mutations, \nand low-level mosaicism. The current evidence base evaluating ES to specifically \nidentify deletions/duplications is limited, but suggests improved detection in recent \nyears.15 \nES has the advantage of decreased turnaround time and increased efficiency \nrelative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.\nES is associated with technical and analytical variability, including uneven \nsequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, as well as \nvariability in variant classification based on proprietary filtering algorithms and \npotential lack of critical clinical history or family samples.16 \nGuidelines and evidence \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2012) stated the following \nregarding the clinical application of exome and genome testing:17\n\"WGS [whole genome sequencing]/WES should be considered in the clinical \ndiagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:\" \no“The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but \nthe phenotype does not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic \ntest targeting a specific gene is available on a clinical basis.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The current technology does not\nsupport short turnaround times, which are often expected in the prenatal setting.\nThere are high rates of false positives, false negatives, and variants of unknown \nclinical significance. These can be expected to be significantly higher than seen \nwhen array CGH is used in prenatal diagnosis.”  \nThe following were recommended pretest considerations: \no“Pretest counseling should be done by a medical geneticist or an affiliated \ngenetic counselor and should include a formal consent process.”  \no“Before initiating WGS/WES, participants should be counseled regarding the \nexpected outcomes of testing, the likelihood and type of incidental results that \ncould be generated, and what results will or will not be disclosed.”  \no“As part of the pretest counseling, a clear distinction should be made between \nclinical and research-based testing. In many cases, findings will include variants \nof unknown significance that might be the subject for research; in such \ninstances a protocol approved by an institutional review board must be in place \nand appropriate prior informed consent obtained from the participant.”  \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2013) stated the following \nregarding informed consent for exome and genome testing:18\n“Before initiating GS/ES, counseling should be performed by a medical geneticist or\nan affiliated genetic counselor and should include written documentation of consent \nfrom the patient.”  \n“Incidental/secondary findings revealed in either children or adults may have high \nclinical significance for which interventions exist to prevent or ameliorate disease \nseverity. Patients should be informed of this possibility as a part of the informed \nconsent process.”  \n“Pretest counseling should include a discussion of the expected outcomes of \ntesting, the likelihood and type of incidental results that may be generated, and the \ntypes of results that will or will not be returned. Patients should know if and what \ntype of incidental findings may be returned to their referring physician by the \nlaboratory performing the test.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

They stated:19\n“The overall goal of the SFWG [Secondary Findings Working Group] is to \nrecommend a minimum list of genes that places limited excess burden on patients \nand clinical laboratories while maximizing the potential to reduce morbidity and \nmortality when ES/GS is being performed.”  \n“Variants of uncertain significance should not be reported in any gene.”  \n“It is important to reiterate here that use of the SF results should not be a \nreplacement for indication-based diagnostic clinical genetic testing.” \nA table of “ACMG SF v3.0 gene and associated phenotypes recommended for \nreturn as secondary findings from clinical exome and genome sequencing” was \nprovided. ACMG has published updates to this list to expand upon the \nrecommended genes.20,21 \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG, 2020) issued an \neducational Points to Consider Statement addressing good process, benefits, and \nlimitations of using exome sequencing in the prenatal setting.22 \nA 2020 systematic evidence-based review by the ACMG on \"outcomes from exome \nand genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual \ndisability\" stated:23\n\"There is evidence that ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID informs clinical and \nreproductive decision-making, which could lead to improved outcomes for patients \nand their family members.

Prospective studies with adequate population numbers for \nvalidation are needed…. Currently, it is ideally done in the setting of a research \nprotocol. Alternatively, sequencing may be performed outside a research setting on \na case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected for which a confirmatory\ngenetic diagnosis can be obtained more quickly and accurately by sequencing. \nSuch cases should be managed after consultation with and under the expert \nguidance of genetic professionals working in multidisciplinary teams with expertise \nin the clinical diagnostic application of sequencing, including interpretation of \ngenomic sequencing results and how they translate to the prenatal setting, as well \nas expertise in prenatal imaging and counseling.”  \n“There is currently limited genotype-phenotype correlation for the genetic disorders \nidentified in the fetal period because ultrasound imaging is frequently limited, and \nthe fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Results of testing with ES include known pathogenic variants\ndefinitely associated with disease or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).13,14 \nPathogenic variants that can be identified by ES include missense, nonsense, \nsplice-site, and small deletions or insertions.\nAt the present time, ES can fail to detect certain classes of disease-causing \nvariants, such as structural variants (e.g., translocations, inversions), abnormal \nchromosome imprinting or methylation, some mid-size insertions and deletions (ca. \n10-500 bp), trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations, deeper intronic mutations, \nand low-level mosaicism. The current evidence base evaluating ES to specifically \nidentify deletions/duplications is limited, but suggests improved detection in recent \nyears.15 \nES has the advantage of decreased turnaround time and increased efficiency \nrelative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.\nES is associated with technical and analytical variability, including uneven \nsequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, as well as \nvariability in variant classification based on proprietary filtering algorithms and \npotential lack of critical clinical history or family samples.16 \nGuidelines and evidence \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2012) stated the following \nregarding the clinical application of exome and genome testing:17\n\"WGS [whole genome sequencing]/WES should be considered in the clinical \ndiagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:\" \no“The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but \nthe phenotype does not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic \ntest targeting a specific gene is available on a clinical basis.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The current technology does not\nsupport short turnaround times, which are often expected in the prenatal setting.\nThere are high rates of false positives, false negatives, and variants of unknown \nclinical significance. These can be expected to be significantly higher than seen \nwhen array CGH is used in prenatal diagnosis.”  \nThe following were recommended pretest considerations: \no“Pretest counseling should be done by a medical geneticist or an affiliated \ngenetic counselor and should include a formal consent process.”  \no“Before initiating WGS/WES, participants should be counseled regarding the \nexpected outcomes of testing, the likelihood and type of incidental results that \ncould be generated, and what results will or will not be disclosed.”  \no“As part of the pretest counseling, a clear distinction should be made between \nclinical and research-based testing. In many cases, findings will include variants \nof unknown significance that might be the subject for research; in such \ninstances a protocol approved by an institutional review board must be in place \nand appropriate prior informed consent obtained from the participant.”  \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2013) stated the following \nregarding informed consent for exome and genome testing:18\n“Before initiating GS/ES, counseling should be performed by a medical geneticist or\nan affiliated genetic counselor and should include written documentation of consent \nfrom the patient.”  \n“Incidental/secondary findings revealed in either children or adults may have high \nclinical significance for which interventions exist to prevent or ameliorate disease \nseverity. Patients should be informed of this possibility as a part of the informed \nconsent process.”  \n“Pretest counseling should include a discussion of the expected outcomes of \ntesting, the likelihood and type of incidental results that may be generated, and the \ntypes of results that will or will not be returned. Patients should know if and what \ntype of incidental findings may be returned to their referring physician by the \nlaboratory performing the test.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Prospective studies with adequate population numbers for \nvalidation are needed…. Currently, it is ideally done in the setting of a research \nprotocol. Alternatively, sequencing may be performed outside a research setting on \na case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected for which a confirmatory\ngenetic diagnosis can be obtained more quickly and accurately by sequencing. \nSuch cases should be managed after consultation with and under the expert \nguidance of genetic professionals working in multidisciplinary teams with expertise \nin the clinical diagnostic application of sequencing, including interpretation of \ngenomic sequencing results and how they translate to the prenatal setting, as well \nas expertise in prenatal imaging and counseling.”  \n“There is currently limited genotype-phenotype correlation for the genetic disorders \nidentified in the fetal period because ultrasound imaging is frequently limited, and \nthe fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

ES \nserves as a powerful diagnostic tool for individuals with rare genetic conditions in which\nthe specific genetic etiology is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup.10,15,30-\n32 \nThe average diagnostic yield of ES is 20-40% depending on the individual's age, \nphenotype, previous workup, and number of comparator samples analyzed.8,11,30,33 \nAmong individuals with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic findings by ES, 5-7% \nreceived a dual molecular diagnosis (i.e., two significant findings associated with \nnon-overlapping clinical presentations).30,33 \nThe use of family trio ES reduces the rate of uncertain findings, adds to the clinical \nsensitivity with regard to the interpretation of clinically novel genes, and increases \nthe diagnostic utility of ES. For example, in three publications the positive rate \nranges from 31-37% in patients undergoing trio analysis compared to 20-23% \npositive rate among proband-only ES.5,30,34,35 \nRe-evaluation of previously obtained exome sequence has the potential for \nadditional diagnostic yield because of constant expansions of existing variant \ndatabases, as well as periodic novel gene discovery.36-38 \nReferences \n1.Shashi V, McConkie-Rosell A, Rosell B, et al The utility of the traditional medical \ngenetics diagnostic evaluation in the context of next-generation sequencing for \nundiagnosed genetic disorders.
