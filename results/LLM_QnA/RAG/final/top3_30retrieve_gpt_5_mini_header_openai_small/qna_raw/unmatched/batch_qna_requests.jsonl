CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

There is a family history notable for a maternal uncle with a movement disorder described as dystonia and ataxia, genetic counseling is not documented in the record, and testing will be billed through Cigna.\n\nInsurance Policy Document (source: combined_3_docs)\nFEP Medical Policy Manual\nFEP 2.04.59 Genetic T esting for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum\nDisorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nAnnual Effective Policy Date: January 1, 2025\nOriginal Policy Date: December 201 1\nRelated Policies:\n2.04.102 - Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\n2.04.1 16 - Invasive Prenatal (Fetal) Diagnostic Testing\n2.04.122 - Chromosomal Microarray Testing for the Evaluation of Pregnancy Loss\nGenetic T esting for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum\nDisorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nDescription\nDescription\nChromosomal microarray (CMA) testing has been proposed for the detection of genetic imbalances in infants or children with characteristics of\ndevelopmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies. CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Scientific Background   \nNeurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons along with deposition of \nmisfolded proteins throughout the body. These misfolded proteins have altered biochemical properties, causing dysfunction. Clinical symptoms may include cognitive decline (primarily dementia) and movement problems (cerebellar dysfunction, hyper - or hypo -kinesia, etc.). The molecular \nspectrum of these disorders may vary, but typically involve oxidative or neuroinflammatory damage (Kovacs, 2016) . \n \nAtaxias (including Friedreich ataxia)  \nAtaxias encompass the set of conditions that are characterized by “motor incoordination resulting \nfrom dysfunction of the cerebellum and its connections” (P. Opal & H.Y. Zoghbi, 2023) . This policy \nfocuses on progressive and degenerative ataxias, which are further subdivided into autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X -linked forms. \n Friedreich ataxia is the most common hereditary ataxia and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most cases are caused by mutations in the frataxin gene ( FXN), which is responsible for \ntransport and management of iron. The frataxin mutation is typically an expanded trinucleotide (GAA) repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene, which reduces expression of frataxin. Severity of \nphenotype varies with the nu mber of repeats; larger repeats are generally more severe. Impaired iron \nmanagement leads to a variety of clinical symptoms, such as neurological problems (progressive \nataxia, dysphagia, motor weakness, loss of tendon reflexes, etc.), cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and skeletal deformities. Clinical findings may suggest Friedreich ataxia, but diagnosis is generally confirmed through genetic testing (P Opal & H.Y. Zoghbi, 2023b) . \n Another autosomal recessive ataxia is ataxia- telangiectasia (AT). AT is caused by a defective gene on \nchromosome 11q22.3, leading to faulty DNA repair mechanisms. This gene (designated AT “M” for mutated) primarily regulates the cell cycle and prevents the  cell cycle from progressing if there is DNA \ndamage. When this gene fails, somatic mutations may accumulate. Symptoms such as immune deficiency, cerebellar ataxia, unusual eye movements, and other neurologic abnormalities are characteristic of ataxia-telan giectasia. Ataxia is one of the first clinical symptoms of patients with AT, \nbut other organ systems are usually affected, such as the skin and circulatory system. Similarly, ataxia-telangiectasia- like disorder (ATLD) can affect individuals similarly to AT ; however, ATLD is due to \nmutations within the MRE11A  gene involved in double -strand DNA break recognition and repair. The \nrate of neurodegeneration in ATLD is typically slower than AT. ATLD is more rare than AT; however, “it is estimated that as many as 5  percent of AT cases may be incorrectly diagnosed and actually have \nATLD, given the similarity in clinical manifestations and coding sizes of the two affected genes” (Opal, 2022) . \n Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are the most common autosomal dominant ataxias. At least 30 types of SCAs with varying phenotypes occur, although, cerebellar ataxia is a primary feature of each type. For example, SCA1 is characterized by dysarthria and bulbar dysfunction whereas SCA2 is characterized by “slow saccadic eye movements.” Several SCA types have a signature CAG repeat beyond what is present in the wildtype; this expansion is pathogenic. As with Friedreich ataxia, larger number of \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 8 of 34 \n \nrepeats usually lead to more severe symptoms. The four most common SCAs are SCA1, 2, 3, and 6, and \neach type is caused by a different pathogenic mutation. Below is a table displaying each SCA, its distinguishing features, and its primary associated gene (P Opal & H.Y. Zoghbi, 2023a) .  \nDisorder  Distinguishing features  Gene  \nSCA1  Pyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy  ATXN1  \nSCA2  Slow saccades; less often myoclonus, areflexia  ATXN2  \nSCA3 (MJD)  Slow saccades, persistent stare, extrapyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy  ATXN3  \nSCA4  Sensory neuropathy  16q22.1  \nSCA5  Early onset but slow progression  SPTBN2  \nSCA6  May have very late onset, mild, may lack family history, nystagmus  CACNA1A  \nSCA7  Macular degeneration  ATXN7  \nSCA8  Mild disease  ATXN8, ATXN8OS  \nSCA9  Not assigned    \nSCA10  Generalized or complex partial seizures  ATXN10  \nSCA11  Mild disease  TTBK2  \nSCA12  Tremor, dementia  PPP2R2B  \nSCA13  Mental retardation  KCNC3  \nSCA14  Intermittent myoclonus with early onset disease  PRKCG  \nSCA15/16  Slowly progressive  ITPR1  \nSCA17 (or HDL4)1 Gait ataxia, dementia  TBP \nSCA18  Pyramidal signs, weakness, sensory axonal neuropathy  7q22 -q32 \nSCA19/22  Predominantly cerebellar syndrome, sometimes with cognitive impairment \nor myoclonus  KCND3  gene  \nSCA20  Palatal tremor and dysphonia  11q12  \nSCA21  Mild to severe cognitive impairment  TMEM240  \nSCA23  Distal sensory deficits  PDYN  \nSCA24  Recessive inheritance; redesignated as SCAR4  1p36  \nSCA25  Sensory neuropathy, facial tics, gastrointestinal symptoms  2p21 -p13 \nSCA26  Pure cerebellar ataxia  EEF2  \nSCA27  Cognitive impairment  FGF14  \nSCA28  Ophthalmoparesis and ptosis  AFG3L2  \nSCA29  Early onset, nonprogressive ataxia; may be an allelic variant of SCA15  3p26  \nSCA30  Slowly progressive, relatively pure ataxia  4q34.3 -q35.1  \nSCA31  Decreased muscle tone  BEAN  \nSCA32  Cognitive impairment; affected individuals with azoospermia and testicular \natrophy  7q32 -q33 \nSCA33  Not assigned    \nSCA34  Skin lesions consisting of papulosquamous erythematous ichthyosiform \nplaques  ELOVL4  \nSCA35  Late onset, slowly progressive gait and limb ataxia  TGM6  \nSCA36  Late onset, truncal ataxia, dysarthria, variable motor neuron disease and \nsensorineural hearing loss  NOP56  \nSCA37  Late onset, falls, dysarthria, clumsiness, abnormal vertical eye movements  1p32  \nSCA38   Slowly progressive pure cerebellar phenotype  ELOVL5  \nSCA39  Not assigned    \nSCA40  Hyperreflexia and spasticity  CCDC88  \nDRPLA  Chorea, seizures, myoclonus, dementia  ATN1  \n1SCA17 is synonymous with HDL4 (Huntington disease -like 4) (Toyoshima et al., 2012) .  \nJacobi et al. (2015)  described the disease progression of SCAs 1, 2, 3, and 6. A total of 462 patients \nwere evaluated on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Annual SARA score increase was 2.11 for SCA1 patients, 1.49 for SCA2, 1.56 for SCA3, and 0.80 for SCA6. The increase of \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 9 of 34 \n \nnon-ataxia signs plateaued in types 1, 2, and 3. SCA6 symptoms were found to increase more slowly \nthan the other three types. Factors associated with a faster increase of SARA score across all types \nwere short duration of follow -up, older age at inclusion (per additional year), and longer repeat \nexpansions (per additional repeat unit) (Jacobi et al., 2015) . \n Reetz et al. (2015) examined the effect of the number of GAA repeats in the FXN  gene on clinical \nsymptoms of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA). A total of 592 patients with FA were sequenced and evaluated. The authors found that with every 100 GAA repeats, the age of onset was 2 -3 years earlier. Disease \nprogression was also found to be faster in patients with more repeats; the annual worsening of the \nScale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score was 1.04 points per year and 1.37 points per year for early and intermediate onset (≤14 and 15 -24 years, respectively), compared to 0.56 points \nper year for late -onset patients (≥25 years) (Reetz et al., 2015). \n Leotti et al. (2021)  examined the contribution that the expanded CAG repeat length has on the rate of \ndisease progression in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado -Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD). Expanded \nCAG repeat in ATXN3 is the mutation that causes SCA3/MJD, and the length of CAG repeat can determine the age of onset of clinical symptoms. The authors studied 82 patients with SCA3/MJD over 15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and found that “The length of the CAG repeat was positively correlate d with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the \ndifferences between patients.” The authors concluded that the length of CAG repeat in ATXN3 has major influence over clinical symptoms (Leotti et al., 2021) .  \n Schuermans et al. (2023)  performed an observational study to assess the diagnostic value of exome \nsequencing and multigene panel analysis for adult -onset neurologic disorders, including ataxias. In \n2019, 6 diagnostic gene panels were introduced at the center for Medical Genetics of the Ghent University Hospital to diagnose patients with neurologic disorders. One of these panels was for ataxia and spasticity and included 390 genes. While the most common ataxia genes were not included in this panel, only 33% of the diagnosed patient s had first been tested for SCAs, Friedrich ataxia, or fragile X \ntremor/ataxia syndrome. The panels included single nucleotide variants, small indels, and copy number variants. Of the panels and targeted patient populations examined by the authors, the mul ti-\ngene panel for ataxia and spasticity had the highest diagnostic yield, identifying the causal pathogenic variant (s) in 19% of the assessed patients (70 of 365) (Schuermans et al., 2023) . \n Dystonias  \nDystonias are a class of movement disorders characterized by “sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements, postures, or both” (Deik & Comelia, 2023) . Movements are typically twisting or patterned and are often worsened by voluntary action. The \nbasic neurochemistry of dystonia is unknown (and without consistent findings), and cell degeneration \nis typically not seen. However, some types of dystonia (particularly early -onset versions) have clear \nassociations with certain genes. For example, TOR1A  and THAP1  both carry pathogenic mutations for \nearly -onset dystonia. TOR1A  (DYT1 ) encodes a protein that binds to ATP (torsin A) while THAP1  (DYT6 ) \nencodes a tran scription regulator for torsin A (Deik & Comelia, 2023) . \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 10 of 34 \n \nDystonias are divided into classes or types. They can be focal (involving a single site), multifocal \nsegmental (involving region(s) of the body), generalized (involving the trunk and at least two additional sites), or hemidystonia (affecting only one side of the body). The etiology of the disorder can be either idiopathic or of known causation. Dystonias can be due to trauma or may be inherited. Those forms of proven genetic origin can be inherited in different inheritance patterns, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X -linked recessive, or even mitochondrial inheritance. The most common \ninherited form of dystonia is DYT -TOR1A (or DYT1) dystonia. DYT -TOR1A accounts for approximately \n40-65% of early -onset generalized dystonia in populations other than the Ashkenazi Jewish population. \nWithin the latter population, DYT- TOR1A is estimated to account for 90% of these cases (Deik & \nComelia, 2023) . Even though DYT -TOR1A dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, the \npenetrance is only 30% (Bressman, 2004; Deik & Comelia, 2023; Ozelius & Lubarr, 2016) . Paroxysmal \ndyskinesia with dystonia (PKND) is a special class of dystonia that involves spontaneous episodes of dystonia. Several environmental factors have been proposed to precipitate these episodes, such as stress, caffeine, and fatigue. The primary g ene associated with PKND is MR1 , or DYT8 . Another special \nclass of dystonia is myoclonus -dystonia, which is characterized by short, involuntary movements of the \nneck or arms in addition to normal dystonia symptoms. The main established type of myoclonus -\ndystonia is caused by mutations in the SGCE  (DYT11 ) gene (Deik & Comelia, 2023) .  \n Zech et al. (2017)  performed whole exome sequencing on 16 patients with “genetically undefined \nearly -onset generalized dystonia.” Six patients had mutations of known dystonia -related genes. The \nmutated genes were GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A, ANO3 , and ADCY5 . The authors noted GCH1, THAP1 , and \nTOR1A  as associated with isolated, generalized dystonia and ANO3  and ADCY5  associated with a \ncombined myoclonus -dystonia phenotype (Zech et al., 2017) . \n Parkinsonism (Parkinson Disease, PD)  \nParkinsonism is a constellation of symptoms with “any combination of bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and postural instability.” The most common form of parkinsonism is Parkinson disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by d egeneration of dopaminergic neurons in \nthe brain (Chou, 2023b) . The pathogenesis of PD is driven by loss of dopamine from the basal ganglia \nin the brain; though a number of compensatory mechanisms may mitigate this loss of dopamine, the progression of disease eventually leads to clinical symptoms (Jankovic, 2023). The “cardinal” features of PD are “tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity”; postural instability is commonly considered a defining feature, yet it typically manifests late in the course of disease. Other motor symptoms such as dysphagia, blurred vision, shuf fling, are common; these secondary motor symptoms are commonly \nderived from the cardinal features. Nonmotor symptoms include cognitive deterioration, dementia, and other mood disorders (Chou, 2023a) . \n The exact cause of PD is unknown, but several genetic factors have been Identified. These genes do \nnot imply a particular phenotype, and each mutation vary in severity of symptomology. Genes \nassociated with PD are SNCA (PARK1/4), LRRK2 (PARK8), PINK1, PARK2, DJ- 1 (PARK7) , and GBA  \n(Jankovic, 2023).  GBA - (glucocerebrosidase) associated PD is coupled with the lysosomal storage condition known as \nGaucher disease, which is commonly seen in Ashkenazi Jews (Jankovic, 2023). Sidransky et al. (2009)  \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 11 of 34 \n \ncompared PD patients with a GBA mutation to those with PD but without a GBA  mutation, and they \nfound that the patients with a GBA  mutation had an earlier age of onset and greater chance of \ncognitive impairment, albeit with less pronounced cardinal features (Sidransky et al., 2009) . \nSNCA encodes alpha -synuclein. Although its exact role is not well understood, it is thought to function \nin synaptic plasticity and makes up as much as 1 percent of total central nervous system protein. \nObservations suggest a role for mutated alpha -synuclein in  the pathogenesis of PD; for example, Lewy \nbodies, the primary pathologic hallmark of PD, have insoluble, aggregated alpha -synuclein as a major \ncomponent. It may also be possible for misfolded alpha- synuclein to be transmitted from diseased \nneurons to healthy ones. PARK1  refers to a missense mutation in SNCA whereas PARK4  refers to a \nmultiplication (Jankovic, 2023). \n LRRK2  (leucine -rich repeat kinase -2) encodes a protein called dardarin. Dardarin is thought to function \nas a kinase for phosphorylation of certain proteins, such as alpha- synuclein and microtubule -\nassociated protein tau. Dardarin may also be implicated in membrane and protein transport. The  \nphenotype of LRRK2  mutations is noted to be less severe than other genotypes of PD; patients have \nbeen observed to respond to levodopa, have a later age of onset, and less severe cognitive deterioration (Jankovic, 2023) . \n PARK2  encodes a protein called parkin. This protein is associated with degradation of certain proteins \nin wild -type genes; the mutated version of parkin cannot clear proteins, allowing them to aggregate in \nthe neuron. This mutation typically leads to an early -age onset of PD and clinical symptoms, although \nthe severity of these early symptoms does not appear to be significantly worse than other genotypes (Jankovic, 2023).  DJ-1 and PINK1  are both associated with autosomal recessive inheritance and early age of onset (under \n50 for PINK1  mutations, under 40 for DJ -1 mutations). PINK1  mutations are possibly associated with \nmitochondrial dysfunction whereas DJ-1 mutations may lead to increased neuro -oxidative stress \n(Jankovic, 2023). \n \nNalls et al. (2014)  performed a meta -analysis of genome -wide association studies on PD. A common \nset of 7893274 variants with 13708 cases and 95282 controls were evaluated. Thirty -two loci were \nidentified as having genome -wide significant association. These 32 loci were re -tested in an \nindependent set of 5353 cases and 5551 controls, and 24 of these loci replicated their significance. Four loci ( GBA, GAK -DGKQ, SNCA, HLA region) were considered to have a “secondary independent risk \nvariant.” The authors noted that the effect of each individual loci was small, but cumulative risk was “substantial” (Nalls et al., 2014) . \n Maple -Grødem et al. (2021)  studied the significance of glucocerebrosidase gene ( GBA ) carrier status on \nmotor impairment in patients with incident PD. The authors studied 528 patients with PD, using genomic DNA assessment and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). GBA  carriers had a \nfaster annual increase in UPDRS score than non -carriers. The authors conclude that “ GBA  variants are \nlinked to a more aggressive motor disease course over 7 years from diagnosis in patients with PD” (Maple -Grødem et al., 2021) . \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 12 of 34 \n \nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  \nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes significant \nmotor neuron degeneration all over the body. This causes a variety of neuromuscular problems, such as spasticity, weakness, atrophy, hyperreflexia, cogn itive impairment, and eventual death. ALS is \ndivided into two categories: sporadic (90% of cases) and familial (10%) (Elman et al., 2023) .  \n The primary genes tested in ALS cases are superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) and chromosome 9 open \nreading frame 72 ( C9ORF72 ), both of which lead to familial ALS. The enzyme SOD1 catalyzes toxic \nsuperoxide radicals to O2 and H2O2. The mutation thought to be the primary cause of SOD1- mediated \ntoxicity is a gain- of-function mutation, creating many reactive oxygen species. Other hypotheses of \nSOD1 -mediated toxicity include misfolded proteins caused by SOD1  mutations and production of \nprotein aggregates that damage motor neurons (Maragakis, 2023) . \n C9ORF72  expansions are another common cause of familial ALS. This mutation is a hexanucleotide \nrepeat (GGGGCC) that forms a structure called the G -quadruplex. The exact pathogenic mechanism is \nunknown, but some hypotheses include creation of defective RNA transcr ipts and creation of toxic \ndipeptide proteins that cause RNA processing to falter (Maragakis, 2023) . \n Chiò et al. (2012)  evaluated the genetic landscape of ALS in an Italian cohort. A total of 475 patients \nwere examined, and 51 were noted to carry a mutation associated with ALS. Familial ALS was found in 46 of these patients, and 31 of these 46 were found to have a genetic mutation (leaving 20 mutations in the remaining 429 sporadic cases). After performing a logistic regression, the authors found that the chance to carry a genetic mutation was related to the presence of comorbid frontotemporal dementia by an odds ratio of 3 .5 (Chiò et al., 2012) . \n Vajda et al. (2017)  evaluated clinician opinion on genetic testing in ALS. Responses from 167 clinicians \nin 21 countries were analyzed. Approximately 90.2% of respondents were found to have offered genetic testing to patients they defined as having familial ALS and 49.4% to patients with sporadic ALS. \nThe four main genes tested were SOD1, C9ORF72, TARDBP , and FUS . Further, 42% of respondents did \nnot offer genetic testing to asymptomatic family members of patients with familial ALS (Vajda et al., \n2017) . \n Bandres -Ciga et al. (2019)  used publicly available genome -wide association studies to identify shared \npolygenic risk genetic factors and casual associations in 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Positive associations were found with smoking and moderate physical activity levels,  and negative associations \nwere found with higher education, cognitive performance, and light physical activity levels. Further, the authors report that “hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci o f interest” (Bandres -Ciga et al., 2019) .  \n Wilson Disease (WD)  \nWilson disease (WD) is a condition caused by defective copper transport. This leads to accumulation of copper in several organs, such as the brain, eyes, and liver. Eventually, the liver becomes cirrhotic, while other neurological conditions may develop. T he primary gene handling hepatocyte copper \ntransport is ATP7B . Normally, this gene mediates the transport of copper into apoceruloplasmin, which \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 13 of 34 \n \nis then secreted into the bloodstream. Mutations in this gene cause impaired binding of copper to the \nprotein, causing copper accumulation in the hepatocyte and eventually the bloodstream (Schilsky, 2022) . \n Dong et al. (2016)  evaluated the genetic spectrum of WD in Chinese patients. A total of 632 patients \nwith WD were compared against 503 controls. Further, 161 variants were found in the WD patents, and 142 were considered pathogenic or “likely pathogenic.” The authors conclu ded that 569 of the 632 \npatients (90%) could be diagnosed with two or more “likely pathogenic” or worse variants. Finally, the 14 most common variants were found at least once in 537 of the 569 (94%) genetically diagnosed \npatients (Dong et al., 2016) . \n \nHuntington Disease (HD)  \nHuntington disease (HD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by choreiform (brief, abrupt, and involuntary) movements, psychiatric disorders, and eventual dementia. During the early stages of the disease, patients may be able to funct ion day -to-day and perform typical tasks; \nhowever, as the disease progresses, patients lose their ability to function independently and require assistance. In the late stages of the disease, patients often become bedridden as cognitive and motor ability continues to decline, with death occurring 10 to 40 years after onset. Currently there is no cure, and the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (Suchowersky, 2023) . \n Huntington disease is primarily caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. A cytosine -adenine -\nguanine “repeat” encodes for polyglutamine tracts in the huntingtin ( HTT) gene, and the “expansion” \nrefers to additional repeats of this trinucleotide side. Approximately 6 -26 CAG repeats is considered \nwild -type, 27 -35 repeats is considered intermediate (i.e. typically do not cause disease but may expand \nin future generations) , and ≥36 repeats is considered diagnostic of HD. CAG repeat length is considered \nto corr elate with both rate of disease progression and severity of neurological changes. The CAG \nrepeat expansion leads to a toxic “gain -of-function” of the HTT  protein, and although the exact \nfunction of this huntingtin protein is unknown, it interacts with several different proteins, implying \nthat it has a function in several cellular events. Mutant huntingtin is seen to disrupt transcription, \nactivation of pro teases, synaptic transmission, and more (Zoghbi & Orr, 2022). \n Baig et al. (2016)  reviewed 22 years of predictive testing performed by the UK’s Huntington \nConsortium. A total of 9407 predictive tests were performed over 23 testing centers, with 8441 tests on individuals considered at 50% predictive risk. Of these 8441, 4629 were mutation negative and 3790 were mutation positive (with 22 tests as “uninterpretable”). A prevalence figure of 12.3 x 10\n—5 \nwas used to evaluate the “cumulative uptake” of predictive testing at the 50% risk level; this amount was calculated to be 17.4% (the number of individuals at 50% risk that had undergone predictive testing). The authors concluded that the majority of indiv iduals at risk for HD had not undergone \npredictive testing (Baig et al., 2016) . \n Spinal Muscular Atrophies (SMA)  \nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) disorders encompass the set of disorders that are characterized by the degeneration of anterior “horn” cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem. This leads to muscle weakness and atrophy, although cogni tion is unaffected. There are currently five main \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 14 of 34 \n \ntypes of SMA, types 0 to 4. These types are organized by age of onset and clinical presentation, with \ntypes 0 and 1 presenting earliest and with the most severe symptoms and type 4 as the least severe phenotype. For example, type 0 presents prenatally and death occurs by six months, whereas type 4 patients usually remain ambulatory and have a normal lifespan (Bodamer, 2023) .  \n The primary gene mutation occurs in the survival motor neuron 1 ( SMN1 ) gene. This gene encodes a \nprotein that appears to play a role in mRNA synthesis. The most common mutation in SMN1  is a \ndeletion of exon 7, representing up to 94% of SMA patients. Another gene, SMN2 , may cause \nphenotypic changes in SMN1  due to its effect as a gene modifier. SMN2 encodes an extremely similar \nprotein to SMN1  (only one nucleotide difference), and it may compensate for SMN1  loss. Severity of \nSMA correlates inversely with amount of SMN2 gene copy numbers, which varies from 0 to 8 \n(Bodamer, 2023) . \n Zarkov et al. (2015)  evaluated the association between clinical symptoms and SMN2  gene copy \nnumbers. Forty -three patients with SMA were examined, and 37 of them had homozygous deletions of \nSMN1 exon 7. The genetic characterization of these 37 patients were as follows: “One had SMA type I \nwith 3 SMN2 copies, 11 had SMA type II with 3.1 +/ - 0.7 copies, 17 had SMA type III with 3.7 +/ - 0.9 \ncopies, while 8 had SMA type IV with 4.2 +/ - 0.9 copies.” T he authors concluded that “a higher SMN2 \ngene copy number correlated with less severe disease phenotype,” but they noted that potential other \nphenotype modifiers could not be ignored (Zarkov et al., 2015) . \n \nHereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP)  \nHereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) represents a group of genetic neurodegenerative diseases characterized by increased spasticity of the lower limbs over time (Shribman et al., 2019). Spastic gait is often the only, or main, feature of the syndrome; bladder dysfunction is a common clinical finding as well. More than 70 types of HSP have been identified, and are often due to axon degeneration, leading to progressive degeneration of the corticospinal tracts (Fink, 2014; Opal & Ajroud -Driss, 2022) . The \nclassification of HSP may be based on age of onset, rate of progression, degree of spasticity, and \ngenetics with more than 55 loci related to the disease (Opal & Ajroud -Driss, 2022) . Some of the more \ncommon autosomal dominant forms of HSP may be caused by mutations in the ATL1, SPAST, \nKIAA1096,  KIF5A,  and REEP1  genes; additional genes are associated with autosomal recessive forms, x -\nlinked forms, and mitochondrial forms of HSP (Opal & Ajroud -Driss, 2022) . \n Dong et al. (2018)  performed next- generation sequencing on 149 genes associated with HSP in a \ncohort of 99 individuals. A retrospective study on other patients with HSP was also completed. Different genetic mutations cause different subtypes of HSP such as SPG4, SPG3A, and SPG6. The researchers note that “In ADHSP [autosomal dominant HSP], we found that SPG4 (79%) was the most prevalent [subtype], followed by SPG3A (11%), SPG6 (4%) and SPG33 (2%)… In ARHSP [autosomal \nrecessive HSP], the most common subtype was SPG11 (53%), f ollowed by SPG5 (32%), SPG35 (6%) and \nSPG46 (3%)” (Dong et al., 2018) . \n \nIn 2018, GeneReview published an updated overview of HSP. This overview was last updated in 2021. This document states the following regarding genetic testing:  \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 15 of 34 \n \n• “Concurrent or serial single -gene testing can be considered if clinical findings and/or family \nhistory indicate that involvement of a particular gene or small subset of genes is most likely (see \nTables 1, 2, 3, and 4)”  \n• “A multigene panel that includes some or all of the genes listed in Table 1 is most likely to identify the genetic cause of the condition at the most reasonable cost while limiting identification of variants of uncertain significance and pathogenic variant s in genes that do not \nexplain the underlying phenotype” \n• “Comprehensive genomic testing (which does not require the clinician to determine which gene[s] are likely involved) may be considered. Exome sequencing is most commonly used; genome sequencing is also possible. Exome array (when clinically available) may be considered if exome sequencing is not diagnostic”  \n• “Recommendations for the evaluation of parents of a proband with an apparent de novo  \npathogenic variant include molecular genetic testing of both parents for the pathogenic variant identified in the proband” (Hedera, 2021) . \n•  \nGeneReviews has published four tables (below) which show the genes associated with autosomal dominant HSP, autosomal recessive HSP, X -linked HSP, and maternal (mitochondrial) HSP.  \n Table 1: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia: Genes and Distinguishing Clinical

Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  \nItalian Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genetic (ITALSGEN)  Consortium  \nThe following guidelines were created as a result from a workshop on ALS genetic testing.  \n• “All ALS patients who have a first -degree or second -degree relative with ALS, frontotemporal \ndementia or both, should be offered genetic testing. At present, however, we do not \nrecommend offering genetic testing to sporadic ALS patients, outside research protocols.”  \n• “Genetic testing at present is not indicated in asymptomatic at -risk subjects and, therefore, \nshould not be proposed.”  \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 23 of 34 \n \n• The guidelines also note that “two -thirds of mutations are found in four genes, C9ORF72, SOD1, \nTARDBP and FUS.” Therefore, they state that these genes should be “considered” for routine \ndiagnostic protocol. Furthermore, they note that C9ORF72 testing is “worthwhile” in sporadic \npatients. If these 4 genes are negative, other ALS -related genes may be tested. Finally, UBQLN2  \nis a gene that should be tested if there is suspicion of an X -linked dominant inheritance (Chio et \nal., 2014) . \n•  \nALS Association  \nThe ALS Association published information on genetic testing on their website. They state that \n“Knowing whether your ALS is connected to a specific gene mutation could make you eligible for ongoing clinical trials testing treatments targeted at specific ge nes.” The guidelines go on to state that \n“if genetic testing identifies a disease -causing genetic mutation in a person with ALS, their family \nmembers generally have the option to pursue testing themselves” but note that this is a personal decision with sig nificant costs and benefits (ALSA, 2023) .  \n Ataxias (including Friedreich ataxia)  \nEuropean Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) and European Neurological Society  (ENS)  \nThe EFNS -ENS released joint guidelines on diagnosis and management of chronic ataxias in adulthood. \nTheir genetic testing guidelines are listed below:  \n“In the case of a family history that is compatible with an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, screening for SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17 is recommended (level B). In Asian patients, DRPLA should also be tested for.”  \n“If mutation analysis is negative, we recommend contact with or a referral to a specialized clinic for reviewing the clinical phenotype and further genetic testing (good practice point).”  \n \nI\nn the case of a family history compatible with an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, they \nrecommend a three -s\ntep diagnostic approach.  \nS\ntep 1 includes mutation analysis of the FRDA gene for Friedreic’'s ataxia (although one can refrain \nfrom this in the case of severe cerebellar atrophy).  \nStep 2 includes mutation analysis of the SACS , POLG , Aprataxin ( APTX ) and SPG7  genes (taking into \naccount specific phenotypes).  \nStep 3 includes “referral to a specialized centre, e.g. for skin or muscle biopsy targeted at diagnoses such as Niemann−Pick type C, recessive ataxia with coenzyme Q deficiency [aarF domain containing kinase 3 (ADCK3)/autosomal recessive spinocerebellar at axia 9 (SCAR9)] and mitochondrial \ndisorders, or for extended genetic screening using gene panel diagnostics.”  \n \n“In the case of sporadic ataxia and independent from onset age, we recommend routine testing for \nSCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and DRPLA (in Asian patients) (level B)”(van de Warrenburg et al., 2014) . \n Friedreich’'s Ataxia Research Alliance (FARA)  The FARA notes genetic diagnostic information on their website.  \nThey state that in “more than 95% of abnormal alleles, the mutation is expansion of naturally occurring GAA repeat in first intron (non -coding region) of the frataxin or FRDA gene.”  \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 24 of 34 \n \n“Genetic testing results in ~98% detection in symptomatic individuals. In rare cases, analysis of \nfrataxin protein levels can be helpful to confirming or ruling out a diagnosis…Carrier testing is recommended for anyone with a positive family history of Friedreich ataxia and for partners of known carriers. Presymptomatic testing for at -risk siblings/relatives is available, however genetic \ncounseling is strongly recommended to assist individuals/families in considering the risks vs benefits for testing an unt reatable genetic condition” (FARA, 2022). \n An expert working group was convened to review and provide guidelines for FA. This working group reviewed guidelines from a variety of different societies, and drafted their own guidelines based off \ntheir review. Their genetic testing items are as follows:  \n“Any individual in whom the diagnosis of FRDA is considered should undergo genetic testing for \nFRDA.”  \n“Referral to a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor should be considered on diagnosis of FRDA.”  \n“Requests for pre -symptomatic genetic testing are best managed on a case -by-case basis; there is \nno evidence to support the routine provision or refusal of pre -symptomatic genetic testing for \nFRDA.”  \n“The committee did not reach consensus on the issue of whether it is appropriate to conduct presymptomatic testing in a minor. Where a request for presymptomatic testing in a minor occurs, the individual/family should be referred to a team with expertise in this field for discussion about \npre-symptomatic genetic testing in which the risks and benefits of pre -symptomatic genetic \ndiagnosis are put forward. The risks and benefits from both the child’s and parents’ perspectives \nshould be carefully reviewed during the pre -test assessment.”  \n“All patients identified pre -symptomatically and their families would benefit from immediate post -\ntest counseling and psychosocial support and referral for appropriate neurological and cardiac surveillance.”  \n“Carrier testing should be first undertaken on the closest relative” (Corben et al., 2014) . \n For Friedreich Ataxia due to compound heterozygosity for a FXN  Intron 1 GAA expansion and point \nmutation/insertion/deletion:  \n“If a person compound heterozygous for a FXN  GAA expansion and a point \nmutation/insertion/deletion has a similar phenotype to those with FRDA due to homozygosity for GAA expansions, they should be managed as per the guidelines in this document.”  \n“If spastic ataxia is the predominant phenotype, then the main management issue is that of spasticity and the guidelines for management of spasticity should be followed” (Corben et al., 2014) . \n Ataxia UK  \nGenetic tests are recommended as part of the secondary care regimen for ataxia. The secondary care is divided into “first line” and “second line” for adults.  \n The first line genetic tests are for: FRDA, SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (12, 17), and FXTAS. The second line genetic tests are for any remaining genes (de Silva et al., 2019) . The guidelines list genes associated with types \nof ataxia (Bonney et al., 2016) . \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 25 of 34 \n \nSpinocerebellar ataxias:  \nType \n(SC )  Gene  \n1 ATXN1  \n2 ATXN2  \n3 ATXN3  \n5 SPTBN2  \n6 CACNA1A  \n7 ATXN7  \n8 ATXN8OS  \n10 ATXN10  \n11 TTBK2  \n12 PPP2R2B  \n13 KCNC3  \n14 PRKCG  \n15/16  ITPR1  \n17 TBP \n19/22  KDND3  \n23 PDYN  \n27 FGF14  \n28 AFG3L2  \n31 BEAN1  \n35 TGM6  \n36 NOP56  \n38 ELOVL5  \n40 CCDC88C  \n41 TRPC3  \n \nThe guidelines note that the clinical validity of genetic testing for SCA8 by CAG repeat sizing has not been determined. Therefore, SCA8 should not be offered as a routine test if family history is unknown. However, testing may be appropriate in “large ped igrees where the expansion has been proven to be \nsegregating with the disease” (Bonney et al., 2016) . \n SCAs are considered autosomal dominant ataxias. Autosomal dominant ataxias also include GSS, DRPLA, POLG1, and EA types 1 and 2.  \n \nAutosomal reccessive ataxia genes include FXN  (Frederich’s Ataxia), APTX, SETX, SACS, SPG7, ATM, and \nTTPA  (Ataxia with Vitamin E deficiency).  \n \nMitochondrial Ataxias include NARP, MELAS, and MERRF.  \n X-Linked Ataxias include FXTAS (Fragile X associated Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome).  \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 26 of 34 \n \nFor children, second -line diagnostic tests for chronic ataxias include DNA testing for the FXN  gene is \nrecommended for suspected Frederich’s Ataxia, ATM  testing is recommended for suspected ataxia -\ntelangiectasia, and general DNA testing is recommended for “other conditions.” Finally, “genetic \ntesting of asymptomatic ‘at -risk’ minors is not generally recommended, but should be considered on a \ncase -by-case basis” (Bonney et al., 2016) . \n National Ataxia Foundation (NAF)  \nThe National Ataxia Foundation published a “Frequently Asked Questions” document regarding genetic testing for hereditary ataxias. For diagnostic testing, they noted that in sporadic ataxia cases \n(no prior family history of ataxia), genetic testing should only be done after non -genetic causes of \nataxia have been excluded. For predictive testing, a patient “must” know what type of ataxia is present \nin their family to be eligible (NAF, 2015) . \n Dystonias  \nEuropean Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS)  \nThe EFNS has released guidelines on the genetic testing of dystonias, which are listed below:  \n“Genetic testing should be performed after establishing the clinical diagnosis. Genetic testing is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of dystonia without clinical features of dystonia (level B). Genetic counselling is recommended.”  \n \n“D\nYT1 testing is recommended for patients with limb -o\nnset, primary dystonia with onset before age \n30 (level B), as well as in those with onset after age 30 if they have an affected relative with early -\no\nnset dystonia (level B).” \n “\nIn dystonia families, DYT1  testing is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals (good practice \npoint).”  \n \n“D\nYT6 testing is recommended in early -o\nnset dystonia or familial dystonia with cranio -c\nervical \npredominance or after exclusion of DYT1 (good practice point).” \n \n“\nIndividuals with early -o\nnset myoclonus affecting the arms or neck, particularly if positive for \nautosomal\n-d\nominant inheritance and if triggered by action, should be tested for the DYT11  gene \n(good practice point). If direct sequencing of the SGCE gene is negative, gene dosage studies increase the proportion of mutation\n-p\nositives (level C).”  \n “\nDiagnostic testing for the PNKD gene (DYT8 ) is recommended in symptomatic individuals with \nPNKD (good practice point).”  \n \n“\nGene testing for mutation in GLUT1  is recommended in patients with paroxysmal exercise\n-i\nnduced \ndyskinesias, especially if involvement of GLUT1  is suggested by low CSF/serum glucose ratio, \nepileptic seizures or haemolytic anaemia (good practice point)” (Albanese et al., 2011) . \n Th\ne EFNS also released guidelines on the diagnosis of Huntington’s Disease. In it, they recommend \nthat “diagnostic testing for HD is recommended (Level B) when a patient presents with an otherwise \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 27 of 34 \n \nunexplained clinical syndrome of a progressive choreatic movement disorder and neuropsychiatric \ndisturbances with or without a positive family history of the disease” (Harbo et al., 2009) . \n \nHereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP)  \nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)  \nNORD has published a webpage on HSP. This page states that “Individuals seeking genetic counseling for HSP are recommended to consult a genetic counselor or medical geneticist for specific information”; further, “Genetic testing is often helpful in confirming the clinical diagnosis of HSP and in determining the genetic type of HSP. Results of genetic testing can be used, together with clinical \ninformation, to provide genetic counseling” (NORD, 2017). \n Regarding genetic testing for a HSP diagnosis, NORD states that “Testing for HSP genes is available and performed for individual HSP genes, for panels containing dozens of HSP genes, and by analysis of all genes (whole exome and whole genome analysis). Genetic testing is often helpful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of HSP. Genetic testing is most often able to find causative gene mutations for subjects with HSP who have a family history of a similarly affected first -degree relative. Despite \ndiscovery of more than 60 genes in which mutations cause various types of HSP, many individuals with HSP do not have an identified gene mutation… at present, genetic testing results very rarely influence treatment which is largely directed toward reducing symptoms” (NORD, 2017). \n \nHuntington Disease (HD)  \nWorking Group on Genetic Counselling and Testing of the European Huntington's Disease Network (EHDN)  \nThis Working Group was convened to provide guidelines for diagnostic genetic testing for HD. The guidelines list four groups that “should be considered” for genetic testing.  \n• The first group is “the patient with a positive family history and specific motor symptoms.” The authors note that diagnosis of this group is “not difficult” and that the test may be “little more than a formality.”  \n• The second group is “the patient with no family history, but specific symptoms likely to be HD.” The authors consider diagnostic testing of this group to be “most clinically useful.”  \n• The third group is “the patient with a positive family history and prodromal symptoms, which suggest the impending onset of HD.” The authors state that the motor abnormalities are part of the diagnostic criteria, but other symptoms such as behavioral chang es or other mental \nconditions may present in HD.  \n• The fourth group“is \"the child with a family history of HD and features of juvenile HD.” The authors note this group as challenging to diagnose, and alludes to diagnostic criteria set forth by Nance, which are as follows:  \no “a known family history of HD (often, but not exclusively, the father)  \no and two or more of \n declining school performance  \n Seizures  \n oral motor dysfunction  \n Rigidity  \n gait disturbance” (Craufurd et al., 2015)  \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 28 of 34 \n \nAnother Working Group was convened to evaluate the predictive testing guidelines for HD in 2013. In \nthose guidelines, they noted that HD testing should not be part of routine blood work and that patients under 18 should not be tested. However, they state that genetic counseling should be offered to those desiring to take the test (MacLeod et al., 2013) . MacLeod et al. (2013) was affirmed by the \nAmerican Association of Neurology on January 14, 2014 (AAN, 2014) . \nThe EDHN performed a literature review of scientific and consensual guidelines in 2019. The only major change had to do with deutetrabenazine (Grade A) as a treatment. Other studies were in agreement wiuth previously noted guidelines and recommendations (Bachoud -Lévi et al., 2019) . \n \nParkinsonism (Parkinson Disease, PD)  \nEuropean Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) and Movement Disorder Society –European \nSection (MDS -ES)  \nThese guidelines were created by a Task Force comprised of members from both societies. Their \ngenetic testing recommendations for Parkinson disease are listed below:  \n• “\nTesting for SNCA  point mutations and gene multiplications is recommended only in families \nwith multiple affected members in more than one generation suggestive of dominant inheritance, with early\n- o\nr late -o\nnset PD.”  \n• “L\nRRK2  genetic testing for counselling purposes, specifically directed at known pathogenic \nvariants is recommended in patients with a clinical picture of typical PD and a positive family history suggestive of dominant inheritance.”  \n• “In sporadic patients, genetic testing should be limited to the search for known LRRK2  founder \nmutations in the appropriate populations (i.e. with known high mutation frequencies).”  \n• “Genetic testing for GBA  gene mutations is recommended in patients with typical PD with or \nwithout a positive family history, limited to the known founder mutations of established \npathogenic role in the appropriate populations.” \n• “\nGenetic testing of the parkin, PINK1  and DJ\n-1 g\nenes for counselling purposes is recommended \nin patients with typical PD and positive family history compatible with recessive inheritance, \nparticularly when the disease onset is before the age of 50 years. For sporadic cases, parkin, PINK1  and DJ\n-\n1 genetic testing is recommended when onset is very early, particularly before the \nage of 40.”  \n• “\nTesting of the ATP13A2, PLA2G6 and FBXO7  genes might be considered in cases with very -\ne\narly-o\nnset PD, if no mutation in parkin,  PINK1  and DJ-1 ge\nne has been found.” \n \nF\nor recommendation III, the guideline lists Ashkenazi Jews, North African Arabs, and Basques as \nexamples of high mutation frequency populations (Berardelli et al., 2013) . \nSpinal Muscular Atrophies (SMA)  \n \n218th European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) International Workshop  Researchers, industry representatives, and other representatives from SMA Europe convened to review the current knowledge on the standards of care for SMA. Regarding genetic testing, they noted that “there was consensus that genetic testing is the first li ne investigation when this condition is \nsuspected in a typical case and that muscle biopsy or electromyography should not be performed in a typical presentation. There was also consensus that, at variance with previous recommendations, the current gold standard is SMN1  deletion/mutation and SMN2 copy number testing, with a minimal \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 29 of 34 \n \nstandard of SMN1  deletion testing. Other areas concerning the value of SMN2 copy number were \nmore controversial and a further Delphi round was planned to complete the task” (Finkel et al., 2017) .  \n“Diagnostic testing for HD is recommended (Level B) when a patient presents with an otherwise \nunexplained clinical syndrome of a progressive choreatic movement disorder and neuropsychiatric disturbances with or without a positive family history of the dise ase” (Finkel et al., 2017).   \n American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  ACOG recommended SMA screening for all individuals “considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant.” ACOG also noted that if one parent had a family history of SMA, the other parent should be \ntested for SMN1  deletion if molecular reports for the first parent were not available. These guidelines \nwere reaffirmed in 2021 (ACOG, 2017). \n Wilson Disease (WD)  \nHepatology Committee of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)  \nESPGHAN has published a position paper regarding Wilson disease in children. The genetic testing-relevant items are listed below:  \n The paper stated that the scoring system used for diagnosis of Wilson’s Disease included identification \nof a pathogenic mutation, which was considered one point (the scoring system is as follows: 0 -1: \nunlikely, 2 -3: probable, 4+, highly likely). The paper also notes that if biochemical and clinical \nsymptoms are present, only one mutation needs to be identified to diagnose Wilson disease. If the \npatient is asymptomatic, two mutations must be identified to diagnose “with certainty.” The diagnostic protocol ca lls for biochemical (copper metabolism testing), liver (ALT/AST, bilirubin, et al), and clinical \nevaluation before proceeding to molecular testing, and ATP7B  is the primary gene mutation \nmentioned in evaluation of Wilson disease.  \n \n“Genetic counseling is essential for families of patients with WD, and screening first -degree relatives is \nrecommended by both European and American guidelines.”  \n “It is essential to screen siblings of any patient newly diagnosed with WD because the chance of being a homozygote and developing clinical disease is 25%. Assessment should include physical examination, serum ceruloplasmin, liver function tests, and molecular testing for ATP7B  mutations or haplotype \nstudies if not available. Newborn screening is not warranted and screening may be delayed until 1 to 2 years of age” (Socha et al., 2018) . \n \nVI.

Whole exome sequencing and WGS have been proposed  for use in patients presenting\nwith disorders and anomalies not explained by a standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a\nbroad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether whole exome or whole genome sequencing improves the net health outcome in\nindividuals with suspected genetic disorders.\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Testing of one available parent should be done if both are not \nimmediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  Duo testing is an \nalternate option (child and one parent*) if only one parent is available.   \n \n*a biological sibling may be considered as a substitute if a parent is unavailable.   \n \nRapid Sequencing \nIn the NSIGHT1 trial (Petrikin, 2018) rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS) provided time to \nprovisional diagnosis by 10 days with time to final report of approximately 17 days although the \ntrial required confirmatory testing of WGS results which lengthened the time to rWGS diagnosis \nby 7–10 days. The WGS was performed in ‘rapid run’ mode with minimum depth of 90 Gb per \ngenome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold. \nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and, in the NICU or PICU, when the \ntest is ordered but may be discharged before results are delivered. \nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using \nchromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within rWGS if the test is validated for CNV \nanalysis. \nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, include but are not \nlimited to any of the following: \n Choanal atresia \n Coloboma \n Hirschsprung disease \n Meconium ileus \n \nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic \nphenotype include, but are not limited to, any of the following: \n Abnormal newborn screen \n Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis \n Hyperammonemia \n Lactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion \n Refractory or severe hypoglycemia \n \nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include, but not limited to, any of the \nfollowing: \n Significant hypotonia \n Persistent seizures \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 4  \n Infant with high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief resolved unexplained event \n(BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features: \no Recurrent events without respiratory infection \no Recurrent witnessed seizure like events \no Required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \no Significantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate \nor lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other tests that suggest an inborn error \nof metabolism \n Significantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible \nchannelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or structural heart disease \n Family history of: \no Arrhythmia \no BRUE in sibling \no Developmental delay \no Inborn error of metabolism or genetic disease \no Long QT syndrome (LQTS) \no Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- \nor second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant \n \nBRUE \nBrief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) was previously known as apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE). In a practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is \ndefined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports \na sudden, brief (usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the \nfollowing: \n Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing \n Altered level of responsiveness \n Cyanosis or pallor \n Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia) \nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting \nan appropriate history and physical examination.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Definitions  \n \nComparator : A DNA sequence that is used to compare to the individual’s DNA sequence. This may be a parent or sibling \nof the individual, or non -cancerous tissue that is being compared to the individual’s tumor tissue (Thun et al., 2017).  \n \nConsanguinity : Procreation with second- cousins or closer ( Bennett et al., 2021).  \n \nGlobal Developmental Delay:  A significant delay in 2 or more developmental domains, including gross or fine motor, \nspeech/language, cognitive, social/personal, and activities of daily living with onset prior to 5 years of age (Shevell et al ., \n2003) . \n \nIntellectual Disability : A condition diagnosed before age 18 that includes below -average intellectual function and a lack \nof skills necessary for daily living  (MedlinePlus , 2020 a). \n \nNext Generation Sequencing (NGS) : New sequencing techniques that can quickly analyze multiple sections of DNA at \nthe same time. Older forms of sequencing could only analyze one section of DNA at once.  \n Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) : A test performed to analyze the DNA from oocytes or embryos for human \nleukocyte antigen (HLA) -typing or for determining genetic abnormalities. These include:  \n PGT-A: For aneuploidy screening (formerly PGS)  \n PGT-M: For monogenic/single gene defects (formerly single -gene PGD)  \n PGT-SR: For chromosomal structural rearrangements (formerly chromosomal PGD)  \n(Zegers -Hochschild et al., 2017)  \n Variant of Unknown Significance (VUS) : A variation in a genetic sequence that has an unknown association with \ndisease. It may also be called an unclassified variant  (MedlinePlus 2020c) . \n Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) : About 1% of a person’s DNA makes protein. These protein making sections are \ncalled exons. All the exons together are called the exome. WES is a DNA analysis technique that looks at all of the exons \nin a person at one time, rather than gene by gene ( MedlinePlus , 2020b).  \n Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) : WGS determines the sequence of all of the DNA in a person, which includes the \nprotein making (coding) as well as non -coding DNA elements ( MedlinePlus , 2020b). \n \nApplicable Codes  \n The following list(s) of procedure and/or diagnosis codes is provided for reference purposes only and may not be all \ninclusive. Listing of a code in this policy does not imply that the service described by the code is a covered or non -covered \nhealth servic e. Benefit coverage for health services is determined by the member specific benefit plan document and \napplicable laws that may require coverage for a specific service.

The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that encodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome (Chung, 2023).  Most known \ndisease- causing variants are found in the exons and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient analysis can \nbe completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016). WES results in long lists of genetic \nvariants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify disease \ncausing mutations (Richards et al., 2015).  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome ( MedlinePlus , 2020b).  This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023). As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years \n(Taber et al., 2015 ).  \n \nAnother type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid ( RNA ). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transcribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the collective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA pre sent in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology in dications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM),  uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at specific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm  for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics  which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications  (Mantere et al., 2021) . OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n \nChung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES)  and genome sequencing (GS)  in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases.  The meta -\nanalysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations  over a period of \n10 years (2011- 2021) . Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting,  and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility \n(defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes to clinical management  following a diagnosis by ES or GS) , \nrates of variants of uncertain significance ( VUS) , number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from \nES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies  and evaluated. The analys is revealed co mparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36 -0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall , and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35 -0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%) . Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES  (2-579 for GS  vs 1-75 for ES) , but the rate of VUS was not significantly different (p = .78). Of the \nnine studies (2,269 probands)  that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times  greater  than ES \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n (95% CI 0.79 -1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis  compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults  regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS ; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With re spect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results . Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% -16%. A significant dif ference  in the diagnostic rate between  ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2, 361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40 -0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta -\nanalysis. Additionally,  of ten QUADAS -2 assessed , high- quality  studies  (2,170 probands ) reporting on clinical utility , GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility  than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 -0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis  of relevant published literature. Twenty studies , including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA , met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was \npotential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta -regression . Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%) , and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support  the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals  with short stature and provide a strong base \nof reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes , which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals . \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS,  for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder  (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies supporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals  with this disorder . Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of \nindividuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023) Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low -quality evidence was found  for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified . Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate,  and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES  in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis . Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately  37 articles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affec ted family members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unex plained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by Ewans et al. (2018)  and Bowling  et al.  (2017) , previously discussed in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used i n 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n were epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secondary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS wa s performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year , and \nfor those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undi agnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use \nof genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD.  The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay ( DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for th is study, which took place in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. Th ey found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine exper ienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to high diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s partici pants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid -2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative \nincluded COL2A1 (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES  and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action  and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies (n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2-22%). For WGS, o utcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes ; Hayes notes  that a dditional studies evaluating both larger numbers and \na broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n An additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did  does not address  ID in \nindividuals with other disorders including NDD  or global DD , which are discussed in separate Hayes reports . No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies  and subtypes of NDD , Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing ( NGS ) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy , and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel \nsequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and 28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was not statically  significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p = .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed  is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found \nin this review compared to previous studies . The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; th is \nsystematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. I n addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy , and this review included panel based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants  and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were \nincluded. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, this study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy , Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral pals y; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare-based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years,  and the health care -based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort  (predominantly pediatric) , molecular diagnostic \nyield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort  (predominantly adult) , it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participants and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts.  Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for \nsequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care -based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit ( ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized trial incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days) . The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 days (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants were racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that \ntwice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group received a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed \ngroup at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study , however,  showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical management and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for critically ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretation of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a \nlower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined \nin this study.  \n \nIn a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing \nin individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who were recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequencing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, ophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rheumatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for \ncases with etiologic noncoding, structural,  and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for cl inical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The  researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical \noutcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

(2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics ( ACMG ) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS . \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy . Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive,  and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was \nidentified. Ultimately, 167 articles were included; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly all included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision -making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by S tark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al . (2016) , Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy , were includ ed in th e Malinowsk i et \nal. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 \nparticipants that were extensively phenotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare diseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolo mics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of adults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately 6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020)  examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASD (n = 4), DD/ID (n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting . A total of 37 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the SNVs \nidentified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3% . For the individuals that had positive results, 36.7% \nand 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals with \nDD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their c ohort compared to \ntraditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that they also achieved their secondary objectives of \ndecreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices  about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluation s) addressed ES  for use in individuals  with NDDs. The \nstudy included a meta- analysis  and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES with \nthat of  CMA in affected individuals . The study defined NDD as global DD, ID, and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles addressing \ndiagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of ES was \n36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions ), which is substantially greater than \nprevious studies focused on CMA (15 -20%). The researchers  conclude that the study showed consistent ly better  \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have \nbeen less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneou s cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing. Publications by Vissers et al. (2017 ), Tarailo- Graovac et al. (2016), Retterer et al. \n(2016) , and Lee et al. (2014), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Srivastava systematic review and \nmeta -analysis.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 11 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Groopman et al. (2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 years of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnost ic result in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionable findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score \nand standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients  were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and for the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes.  In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) were found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome \nanalysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes , however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH- funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none \nof which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance rate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malfo rmations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub -group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early intervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome, type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT and G6PD. Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could i mpact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines \narise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by factors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond \nthat currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.  \n \nIn order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta -\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was \n2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were found, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n \nAs part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield. In some cases, family testing was performed to \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 12 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n determine gene segregation and verify pathogenicity. The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent \nspecialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary \nspastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n \nBardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical indications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing \nfor Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes were selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in 52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platform s or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the \ninvolvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.  \n \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August 2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta ‐analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of \nWES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WG S and WES was not significantly different. In studies with \nin-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference la b interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statis tically significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnostic rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be cons idered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n The diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One BRCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a change in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/60 1, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non -sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling \nfor variant discussion.  \n Another study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a cohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioResource Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs  that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality \nwas poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate \nvaried by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individuals had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that the WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection \nrate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 - 5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from cons anguineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A , PPOX, FRMP D4, and SCN1B , and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a first-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics’  laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n neurological group. The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening \nA 2023 systematic review and meta -analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Secondary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 4 7%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9 -24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27 -51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time f or CMA/ WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended. Public ations  by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study  assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies where CMA had been negative. Testi ng took place between the 12\nth and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded (n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm) . For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence \nvariation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was 40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS , related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply . The researchers assert that  although this \nstudy is limited by small sample size,  the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has  promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use. \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies were included in this review , representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled increm ental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre -selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases (42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these results, \nthe researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a diagnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with structural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided  a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending on the body \nsystem impacted and can be increased by specific pre -selection of cas es after a multi -disciplinary review indicating \nlikelihood of a monogenic  cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies that were \nevaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of \nanalysis which likely impact diagnostic yield.  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of prenatal ES \nto gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritiz e cases for testing \nand the challenges that exist for interpreting variants with incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding phenotype.  \nPublications by Chen et al.

Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were  obtained prior to exome analysis.  After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified  as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were \nidentified that were determined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant  was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progress ed. The authors  \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogenic variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics  in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta -analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies)  with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yiel d of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these,  42% of variants were \nhomozygous . Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appear to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndr omes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon. A 2020 (updated 202 3) Hayes Clinical \nUtility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS  related to improvement of diagnosis and assist ance \nwith pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are detected by ultrasound or other testing is \nlacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for \nthe use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologic diseases. Specifically , relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions,  and deletions  and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenom e Analysis Platform  (GPAP) . This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals , 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels . Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platf orm used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals , which, according to their referring clinicians, would enable \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to \nlead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to \nefficient reanalysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \nIn an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n undiagnosed children who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re -evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of bet ter bioinformatic pipelines , improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification \nof previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. \nThe study showed that not  all afflicted individuals  will under go routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey , \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting  and considered all di sease -related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new diagnoses , however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The literature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examin ed 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two \nyears of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new diagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs . The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n Alfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of W ES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton system. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs  may not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the \nstudy and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclus ive WES results. Most were \nmale (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patients had complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS \nresults with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because \nthe data that demonstrated their pathoge nicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original raw data files were not available from this lab to determine if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four variants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re -analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \nand the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of posi tives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n To evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis,  Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date software and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent,  or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnostic exomes . This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 -3 year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of rela tionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround -times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinic al utility of these rapid and ultra- rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra- rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), discussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gubbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n Dimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed \nhad cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). The goal of the NSIGHT study was to compare two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two interpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who received urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra -\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled,  and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 hours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. Of the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, res pectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \nurWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0. 0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n were randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, critically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants  whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to less seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of both tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with \nundiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30 -50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. \nSanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings \noutside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n Clark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a \nprovisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the mean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four \ntimed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity,  and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling \ntook a median of 1 hour a nd is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant \nvariants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and optimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady  Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and logical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was sel ected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospect ively in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with two children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the prior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously i ll infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 \nhours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger  \nsequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Whole  Transcriptome Sequencing \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole  transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders  in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent  a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently  referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS . The results of RNAseq were combined with genome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional \nseven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested  negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels , and SV s were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 \nsamples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7 –27%) , bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29– 48%) . The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of \nRNAseq.  The study was limited by its small cohort size which  underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center , \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional studies on broader populations and focused on improvement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication.  Although it \nshows early  promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, f urther  development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential  clinical \nutility . \n \nMantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities  in a proof -of-principle study . In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra -high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM.  The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not (n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders (n  = 1 5), family history of chromosome abnormality (n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound (n = \n9). The result was compared to known anom alies obtained via current standard -of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities.  They foresee  continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress  filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV  and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- qualit y clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n Additional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series  where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) . \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified through routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available.

Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nIn an AANEM 2016 consensus statement, the group stated that while they do not endorse or recommend a specific \ntesting methodology, genetic testing to establish a molecular diagnosis is a crucial step in providing optimal care to individuals with neuromuscular disorders (Kassardjian et al., 2016, reaffirmed 2021).  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nIn a 2021 practice guideline authored by Manickam et al., the ACMG asserts their position that evidenced- based literature \nsupports clinical utility of whole exome and whole genome sequencing on both active and long- term management of \nindividuals with congenital anomalies, developmental delay,  and intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). Based on their \ncomprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first- or second -tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included  an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of \nstandard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0  (Miller et al., 2021b) , contained 73 genes and detailed the way that  genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list  (v3.1); a  total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR (hereditary TTR  amyloidosis ). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM 3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome) , bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n \nMonaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health -care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be \nobtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n \nA 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test \nresults. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re -evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory  work collaboratively in the testing process .” \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significan ce,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the interpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole -\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”  \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021)  addressing the management of stillbirth indicates \nthat whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth . \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023) Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has  \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability  to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances ( e.g., fetuses  with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific genes of  clinical  interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances,  WES or WGS may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG)  \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS  in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG , and Horizon 2020 project Solve -RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases  using various analytical techniques.  The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, efficiency,  and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed in accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation,  and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal \nanomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple  organ system anomalies and;  \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly  pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies and;  \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a \nfetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status  of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline.  \n The guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or \nneurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and comprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) \nIn a 2022  evidence -based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy  is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology.  The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing , followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider in the context of appropriate pre - and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n This section is to be used for informational purposes only.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

Scientific Background  \nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder affecting approximately \none in 45 children in the United States  with an average male to female ratio  of 4–5:1; very similar ASD \nprevalence  rates are reported around the world . ASD is typically characterized by impaired social \ninteraction and other restrictive and repetitive behaviors , and  ASD is diagnosed behaviorally based on \nthe presence of abnormal social communication and repetitive behavior . \nThe condition may be either idiopathic or syndromic , with many syndromic cases related to genetic \ndisorders , such as Rett syndr ome. While many aspects relating to the etiology of the condition are poorly \nunderstood, ASD is known to have  a strong genetic component; many familial inheritance patterns have \nbeen associated with the condition, and up to 1000 genes may be potentially implicated.  Known ASD \nrisk factors include chromosomal deletion(s) and prematurity. Research ers report that parents who have \na child with autism have a 2- 18% chance of having another child with autism.  \nDiagnosis of ASD includes  a comprehensive evaluation by a multidisciplinary team to determine if the \nchild’s symptoms meet the criteria for ASD , as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of \nMental Disorders  (DSM) , to determine the child’s neurodevelopment profile of strengths and \nweaknesses, and t o assess whether the child has any other associated or underlying condition(s). The \nfifth edition of the DSM requires  the individual have all of the following:  \n• Social communication  and social interaction deficits in multiple settings as demonstrated by all of \nthe following —social- emotional reciprocity, a lack of understanding or awareness  of the feelings of \nothers; nonverbal communicative behaviors; difficulty in developing , maintaining, and \nunderstanding interpersonal relationships; and  \n• Repetitive behavior patterns as demonstrated with at least two of the following— stereotyped or \nrepetitive movements; obsessive , compulsive adherence to routin es or patterns of verbal or \nnonverbal behaviors; highly fixated, abnormal preoccupation on specific interests; increased  or \ndecreased responses to sensory input, such as adverse responses to environment; and  \n• Impaired function due to symptoms ; and  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM217 6 Testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder s and Developmental Delay   Page 3 of 14 \n• Symptoms present early in developmental period of life ; and \n• Symptoms “are not better explained by intellectual disability (formerly referred to as mental \nretardation) or global developmental delay.”  \nA differential diagnosis of ASD from other conditions that impair social communication, interaction, or  \ndevelopment may help guide possible therapeutic options.  These conditions include both global delay \n(or intellectual disability) and intellectual giftedness, social communication disorder, developmental \nlanguage disorder, learning disorders, hearing impairment, Landau -Kleffner syndrome (LKS or acquired \nepileptic  aphasia) , Rett syndrome, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), attachment disorder, \nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD), \nstereotypic movement disorder, or tic disorders (such as Tourette  syndrome). Each of these disorders \nmay share individual characteristics of ASD while exhibiting distinguishing characteristics for their \nrespective condition , such as appropriate imaginative play, normal reciprocal social interactions, or \nspecific morphologies (e.g. the characteristic facial features of FASD ). \nBoth genetic and environmental factors play a part in the etiology of ASD. Even though  ASD is more \nprevalent in males, male -to-male transmission in certain lineages indicates that ASD is not solely X -linked  \n(Hallmayer et al., 1996; Muhle, Trentacoste, & Rapin, 2004) . Genetic analysis can be performed using \nchromosomal microarray, karyotype, or genetic sequencing including next -generation sequencing (NGS) \nor whole exome sequence (WES) analysis. Specific genetic testing should be based on the clinical findings \nof the affected individual and family history. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics reports “the following approximate diagnostic yields are expected in the genetic evaluation of ASDs:  \n• CMA [chromosomal microarray] (10%)  \n• Fragile X (1 -5%) \n• MECP2  (4% of females)  \n• PTEN (5% of those with head circumferences >2.5 SDs [standard deviations ] that are tested)  \n• Karyotype (3%)  \n• Other (10%).  Currently, there are no published studies that collate the yield on the other identifiable \netiologies of autism… Using empiric estimates and clinical experience, this has been estimated as \n10%.”  \n \nChromosomal microarray (CMA) is a microarray -based genomic copy -number analysis test that can be \nused to help diagnose unexplained developmental delay, intellectual disability, and ASD, as well as \nmultiple congenital anomalie s. CMA cannot detect balanced translocations; however, these de novo \ntranslocations are infrequently encountered .  Karyotype can be used in instances where a balanced \ntranslocation is suspected, such as a history of two or more miscarriages.  \nBesides CMA and karyotyping, genetic sequencing  can be used to screen for possible mutations , in \nparticular NGS and WES analysis.  NGS re fers to the use of a single platform to sequence multiple strands \nof nucleic acid  rapidly in parallel. This technique c an be utilized to screen the entire exome for whole \nexome sequencing (or WES) analysis . A number of genetic tests are commercially available, including \nthe Clarifi ™ test (Quadrant Biosciences, Inc.), an NGS -based saliva test that measures  epigenetic \nmicroR NAs and the microbiome  to generate an algorithmic report of the predictive probability of ASD .  \nWhile it is believed that inborn errors of metabolism account for only 5% of autistic individuals, defects \nin one -carbon metabolism are one of the most -often reported physiopathologies reported to be \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM217 6 Testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder s and Developmental Delay   Page 4 of 14 \nassociated with autism, as these disturbances to cellula r bioenergetics lead to increased oxidative stress, \nimpaired redox homeostasis, and methylation disruption, the third of which portend to deficits in gene \nexpression, neurotransmitter synthesis, and neuronal synchronization. Similarly, with regard to amine s, \nneurotransmitters that are amino acids and their derivatives are thought to play critical roles in the \ndiagnosis of ASD, with hypotheses ranging from the differentiation and migration of neurons, the \nsynaptic plasticity of neurons, and the perturbation of reward- and motivation -related circuits \nmodulated by concentrations of serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine, respectively. It is no surprise, then, that the richness of the field means that it is ripe for a foray into expanding our understanding of ASD and the concomitant therapeutic consequences.  \nIn addition to genetic testin g, different biomarkers have been proposed as possible aids in diagnosing \nASD and developmental delay . The Children’s Autism Metabolome Project (CAMP)  [Clinical Trials \nIdentifier NCT0 2548442 ], funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH)  and \nsponsored by Stemina Biomarker Discovery, Inc. , has a goal to identify metabolic signature profiles in \nblood plasma and/or urine that can differentiate children with ASD from children with either non-ASD \ndelayed development or typical development.   CAMP , expected to be completed in 2023,  is a multi -\ncenter clinical study at eight sites within the United States that has more than 1100 enrolled participants \nas of 2020. To date, the focus has been on amino acid metabolism dysregulation. Stemina Biomarker \nDiscovery, Inc. does offer commercially available biomarker tests for ASD, including the NeuroPointDX  \nAutism Spe ctrum Disorder (NPDX ASD)  blood test , that measures 32 different amines present in blood \nplasma using LC -MS/MS . Then, a proprietary algorithm based on the ADOS -2 reference method indicates \nthe individual’s metabolic subtype (or “metabotype”).   For example,  in a positive metabotype 3 profile \n“indicate[s] a positive metabolic profile associated with ASD. The imbalance detected indicates an \nincrease in concentration of Glycine relative to the concentration of Asparagine .”  \nClinical Validity and Utility  \nTammimies et al. (2015)  compared the molecular diagnostic yield of CMA and whole exome sequencing \n(WES ) in children (n =  258) with ASD , split into three groups based on severity of morphology (essential, \nequivocal, and complex) .  They note that 15.8% of the children who underwent both CMA and WES \ntesting have an identifiable genetic etiology .  Statistical differences between the three morphological \ngroups were recorded , and the “combined yield was significantly higher in the complex group when \ncompared with the essential group (pairwise comparison, P = .002).”  Individually, CMA and WES \nproduc ed similar yields; for example, 4.2% of children in the essential group tested positive with CMA \nas compared to 3.1% undergoing WES. The authors conclude that “the molecular diagnostic yields of CMA and WES were comparable … If replicated in additional populations, these findings may inform \nappropriate selection of molecular diagnostic testing for children affected by ASD (Tammimies et al., \n2015) .” Rossi et al. (2017)  performed a study of WES on 16 3 individuals with either ASD or autistic \nfeatures , reporting that 61.9% of positive findings were de novo  mutations. Moreover, individuals \n“presenting with psychiatric conditions or ataxia or paraplegia in addition to autism spectrum disorder \nor autistic features were significantly more likely to receive positive results compared with patients \nwithout these clinical features (95.6% vs 27.1%, P < 0.0001; 83.3% vs 21.2%, P < 0.0001, respectively).”  \nRagusa et al. (2020)  evaluated 53 ASD children  who were treatment- naïve and 27 unaffected controls \nby performing miRNA expression profiling and 16S rRNA microbiome analysis on saliva samples . Their \nresults show an upregulation of miR -29a-3p and miR -141-3p and downregulation of miR -16-5p, miR-let-\n7b-50, and mi -R-451a  in children with ASD. “ Microbiome analysis on the same subjects revealed that \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM217 6 Testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder s and Developmental Delay   Page 5 of 14 \nRothia, Filifactor, Actinobacillus, Weeksellaceae, Ralstonia, Pasteurellaceae , and Aggregatibacter  \nincreased their abundance in ASD patients, while Tannerella, Moryella  and TM7 -3 decreased.”  \nHicks et al. (2018)  performed a multi -center, cross -sectional validation study of the Clarifi™ test \n(Quadrant Biosciences, Inc.)  using children aged 19 – 83 months. T he individuals were divided among \nthree groups: a control, neurotypical group (n=134); a group with a diagnosis of ASD (n=238) ; and a \ngroup with non -ASD developmental delay (n=84). Randomly, prior to initiating the study, all individuals \nwere further divid ed between the training and independent validation sets (82% and 18%, respectively). \nThe training set established the RNA -based algorithm to be used to distinguish ASD and non -ASD \nchildren while the validation set was used to test the algorithm accuracy. U sing the established algorithm \nfrom the training set, the authors state that the validation test “ maintained an AUC of 0.88 (82% \nsensitivity and 88% specificity). Notably, the RNA features were implicated in physiologic processes \nrelated to ASD (axon guida nce, neurotrophic signaling) (Hicks et al., 2018) .” These data further \nsupported their earlier findings  from a smaller study ( n=45)  that 14 miRNAs “ were differentially \nexpressed in ASD subjects compared to controls (p <0.05; FDR <0.15) and showed more than 95 % \naccuracy at distinguishing subject groups in the best -fit logistic regression model. ”  \nHicks et al. (2020)  also performed a multi- center study to use saliva microRNAs to differentiate children \nwith ASD  (n=187)  from peers with typical (n= 125) or non-ASD atypical development  (n=69) . 14 miRNAs \nshow ed differential expression, and four miRNAs “best differentiated children with ASD from children \nwithout ASD in training (area under  the curve = 0.725) and validation (area under the curve = 0.694) \nsets. Eight microRNAs were associated (R > 0.25, false discovery rate < 0.05) with social affect, and 10 microRNAs were associated with restricted/repetitive behavior.”  The authors conclude, “ Salivary \nmicroRNAs are “altered” in children with ASD and associated with levels of ASD behaviors. Salivary microRNA collection is noninvasive, identifying ASD -status with moderate accuracy. A multi- ‘omic’ \napproach using additional RNA families could improve accuracy, leading to clinical application.”  \nLászló, Horváth, Eck, and Fekete (1994)  reported that not only were the mean values of serotonin for \nautistic children higher as compared to the control group– 1.253 μmol/l and 0.88 μmol/l, respectively –\nbut also that hyperserotonemia was detected in 20 of the 46 autistic children, corroborating a previous \nreport of elevated levels of serum serotonin in 40% of affected children (László et al., 1994) . The study \nalso noted that in 20% (n=30) of patients lactic acidosis and hyperpyruvatemia were detected in the absence of hyperserotonemia, urging that these metabol ites be explored as important targets for \nmanaging infantile autism.  \nA Seoul National University Bandung Hospital study that recruited 59 subjects afflicted by ASD –sorted \ninto the affected group –and their unaffected family members (both biological parents and unaffected \nsiblings), who comprised the unaffected group of 135 members provides greater evidence for the use of mitochondrial markers in the diagnosis of ASD (Oh, Kim, & Yoo, 2020). The measuring of carbon \nmetabolites demonstrated that not only did the affected group boast significantly higher lactate than the unaffected gr oup (19.79 ± 11.29 vs. 13.84 ± 6.12 mg/dl at p<0.01) but also had higher lactate -to-\npyruvate ratios (21.47 ± 18.43 vs. 15.03 ± 9.37 at p<0.05); however, what was strange was that there were no significant correlations between the parameters themselves  (Oh et al., 2020) . This supports \nprevious findings that reported elevated lactate and l actate -to-pyruvate ratios in ASD individuals, and \nfurther corroborates the notion that defects in mitochondria can lead to and potentially explain neurodevelopmental disorders for their roles in both aerobic energy production and the development of neurons  in the CNS.  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM217 6 Testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder s and Developmental Delay   Page 6 of 14 \nMoreover, another study focusing on the profile of metabolic abnormalities expected due to \nmitochondrial dysfunction demonstrated that in a sample of 146 Egyptian boys (73 autistic, 73 unaffected), plasma levels of lactate and serum pyruvate, lactate -to-pyruvate ratio, creatine kinase, \npyruvate kinase, and LDH (glycolytic enzyme expression) were significantly higher (p<0.05) among the \nsubjects than in the unaffected control group, while amines such as serum L -carnitine (participating in \nthe beta- oxidation of fatty acids) and urea were in turn lower, save for ammonia. Interestingly, blood \nlevels of all previously measured biochemical markers did not differ between mild to moderately autistic \nchildren as compared to  those severely impacted except for significantly higher oxidative stress index \nand significantly lower antioxidant levels, suggesting that the ASD is not explicable by a singular etiology.  \nHowever, though the testing of any one metric for the diagnosis of ASD seems untenable and wastefu l, \nthe use of many measurements operating in conjunction has gained traction. Dysregulation of amino \nacid metabolism was identified by comparing plasma metabolites from 516 children with ASD with a \ncontrol group of 164 typical -development children recruite d into Children’s Autism Metabolome Project  \n(CAMP)  (Smith et al., 2019).Though a simple analysis of the mean concentrations of free plasma amines \ndid not reveal meaningful differences between the ASD and healthy populations of children, the researchers reported that a combination of glutamine, glycine, and ornithine amino acid dysregulation ‘metabotypes’ could be used to identify a dysregulation in amino acid/branch -chained amino acid \nmetabolism that is present in 16.7% of the CAMP ASD subjects and is detectable with a specificity of 96.3% and a PPV of 93.5%, seemingly providi ng the grounds for metabolic testing.  \nArizona State University’s Comprehensive Nutritional and Dietary Intervention Study, a 12 -month \nnutritional and dietary intervention study, compared plasma amino acid concentrations between ASD and typically developed  individuals. 64 study participants were on the autism spectrum and 49 acted as \nage- and gender -matched typical -development (TD) controls. In the clinical study, a total of 42 plasma \namino acids and related metabolites were measured, including the 9 essential and 11 non- essential \namino acids as well as  22 secondary amino acids and amino acid metabolites. However, even given the \ncomprehensiveness of the study, at most could be said was that the results “ indicate possibly elevated \nconcentrations of glutamate,  hydroxyproline, and serine in the plasma of individuals with ASD’ but \nultimately that “c lear discrimination of the cohorts [ASD and TD cohorts] was not possible using these \ndata ”, suggesting that the measurements themselves are less significant than previ ously anticipated. \nHowever, a 2011 study in Arizona analyzed concentrations of 41 amino acids and amino acid metabolites in the plasma of 55 children with ASD and 44 TD children and detected significantly elevated glutamate and significantly decreased tryptophan in the ASD cohort. Similarly, a 2016 Chinese study reported that glutamate in the plasma of 51 children with ASD and 51 controls were significantly higher in the children with ASD consistent with the Arizona study. Therefore, aside from a singular c ommon amino acid, the \nfindings contradict other studies focusing on plasma amino acid measurements in ASD individuals that exalt and exhort it for its purported potential.  \nLaBianca et al. (2021)  conducted a study on the relation between copy number variants  (CNVs)  and \npolygenic risk s cores (PRS) on the extent of care needed for families with histories of autism and/or \nattention -deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) . They estimated  that among a sample of 39 families , the \noverall variance explained by “known, rare, CNVs  and SCZ [schizophrenia] PRS from common SNP [single \nnucleotide  polymorphisms] to be 10% in comorbid ASD and ADH D.” There was also a greater burden of \nboth rare CNVs and SCZ PRS among adult ASD and/or ADHD patients with sustained needs of specialist \ncare than unaffected relatives and any other relatives with mental health disorder. Although the study \nhad a small sample size, having this application of CNVs and PRS can eventually predict care and benefit \nother families with ASD and/or ADHD, as well as assist  in clinical decision making. Furthermore, CNV can \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM217 6 Testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder s and Developmental Delay   Page 7 of 14 \nbe connected to autistic phenotypes. In a study by Chawner et al. (2021) , they found that based on \nclinical cut -offs, four different genetic variant groups had differences in autism severity, IQ, and autism \nsubdomain profiles, with a “substantial variability in phenotypic outcome  within individual genetic \nvariant groups” (74% -97%), with low variability between groups (1% -21% based on trait). For carriers, \n54% with one of four CNVs that did not meet “full autism diagnostic criteria” still had “elevated levels of \nautistic traits.” Collectively, these studies demonstrate that not only can CNVs render predictive value  \nin treatment planning, but also understanding of presentation.  \nGenetic testing also yields pathogenic benefit. In a retrospective chart review by Harris, Sideridis, \nBarbaresi, and Harstad (2020)  on 500 toddlers diagnosed with ASD per the Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, 59.8% completed genetic testing, with 12.0% yielding pathogenic findings  from CMA and fragile X testing . The most common CNVs in this sample were \n“deletions or duplications o n 15q  (n=10)  and 22q  (n=2) . Among subjects with fragile X findings, there \nwere 3 full mutations, 3 pre mutations, 2 intermediate or “grey zone” m utations, and 1 patient with \nmosaicism.” These pathogenic findings also impacted medical recommendations 72.2% of those \npatients , showing how understanding pathogenesis in the setting of ASD can extend into not only \nidentifying potential pathology but also clinical care once again.  \nIV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmerican Academy of Pedia trics (AAP)  \nIn 2020, the American Academy of Pediatrics released extensive guidelines pertaining to the \nidentification, evaluation,  and management of children with ASD. The AAP notes, “The reported \nprevalence of children with ASD has increased over time… This increase  may be attributable to several \nfactors, including broadening in the diagnostic criteria with ongoing revisions of the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) , the more inclusive definition of pervasive developmental \ndisorder with the adoption of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition \n(DSM -IV) in 1994, increased public awareness of the disorder and its symptoms, recommendations for \nuniversal screening for ASD, and increased availability of early intervention and school-based services \nfor children with ASD.”  The AAP goes on to explicitly recommend “screening all children for symptoms \nof ASD through a combination of developmental surveillance at all visits and standardized autism -\nspecific screening tests at 18  and 24 months of age in their primary care visits because children with ASD \ncan be identified as toddlers, and early intervention can and does influence  outcomes.  This autism -\nspecific screening complements the recommended general developmental screening at 9, 18, and 30 \nmonths of age.”  They also recommend the use of the “Learn the Signs. Act Early” parent resources \ndeveloped by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Screening varies by age group, and \nscreening results are not diag nostic . The results are to aid the primary care provider in identifying \nchildren who may require additional evaluation.  For children younger than 18 months, the M -CHAT is \nthe most studied tool, and the AAP notes that parent- administered questionnaires, such as the \nCommunication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Development Profile and the Infant and Toddler Checklist, \nhave been used to screen children as young as 12 -months old. For children 18 - to 30 -months old, the \nmost used  screening tool is  either  the M -CHAT or M -CHAT -R/F (Modified Checklist for Autism in \nToddlers, Revised with Follow -Up Questions).  For children older than 30 months, “there are no validated \nscreening tools available for use in pediatric practice, nor are there current recommendations by the \nAAP for universal screening for ASD in that age group.” \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM217 6 Testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder s and Developmental Delay   Page 8 of 14 \nOnce a child has been determined to be at risk for ASD, the child should see a specialist, such as a \nneurodevelopmental or developme ntal/behavioral pediatrician, psychologist, neurologist, or a \npsychiatrist for a diagnostic evaluation. “At this time, there are no laboratory tests that can be used to \nmake a diagnosis of ASD, so careful review of the child’s behavioral history and direct observation of \nsymptoms are necessary… Formal assessment of language, cognitive, and adaptive abilities and sensory \nstatus is an important component of the diagnostic process.”   The specialist may use questionnaire tools, \nsuch as the SCQ or Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) , or behavioral assessments, such as the Diagnostic \nInterview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO)  or Child Behavior Checklist.  \nConcerning genetic testing, the AAP states that “[g]enetic evaluation should be recommended  and \noffered to all families as part of the etiologic workup”, and they provide a stepwise general approach as \na practical guideline.  \n1. “Consider referral for pediatric genetics evaluation  \n2. Comprehensive history (including 3 -generation family history with emp hasis on individuals with ASD \nand other developmental, behavioral and/or psychiatric, and neurologic diagnoses)  \na. Physical examination (including dysmorphology, growth parameters [including head \ncircumference], and skin examination)  \ni. If syndrome diagnosis or metabolic disorder is suspected, go back to step 1 (genetics and/or \nmetabolism referral) and/or order the appropriate targeted testing)  \nii. Otherwise, proceed to step 3  \n3. Laboratory studies  \na. Discuss and offer CMA analysis  \nb. Discuss and offer fragile X analysis; if family history is suggestive of sex -linked intellectual \ndisabilities, refer to genetics for additional testing  \nc. If a patient is a girl, consider evaluation for Rett syndrome, MECP2  testing  \nd. If these studies do not reveal the etiology, proceed to  step 4  \n4. Consider referral to genetics, workup might include WES  (Hyman et al., 2020) .” \nRegarding the use of potential biomarkers for ASD, AAP states, “Although some studies have attempted \nto differentiate people with and without ASD on the basis of differences in laboratory profiles of platelet \nserotonin, pla sma melatonin, urine melatonin sulfate, redo status, placental trophoblast inclusions, and \nimmune  function, currently no diagnostic laboratory tests have been approved for ASD. To date, none \nof these potential biomarkers under study has sufficient evidence to be recommended.” AAP also notes, \n“The yield of routine metabolic testing for children with AS D is low and not recommended for regular \nuse.” However, they do note that there are uncommon metabolic disorders that may “rarely” be  \nassociated with ASD that may require necessary work -up.  These can include metabolic disorders \ninvolving amino acids,  carnitine, folate, and cholesterol, for example.  \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)  \nThe USPSTF, in 2016, concluded “that the c urrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of \nbenefits and harms of screening for ASD in young children for whom no concerns of ASD have been \nraised by their parents or a clinician (Siu et al., 2016) .”  Withi n this evaluation, the USPSTF did not address \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM217 6 Testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder s and Developmental Delay   Page 9 of 14 \neither genetic testing or the potential use of biomarkers for screening ASD.  This guideline is currently \nbeing updated as of June 4, 2021.  \nThe International Standard Cytogenomic Array (ISCA) Consortium   \nIn 2010, the ISCA released a consensus statement that chromosomal microarray is a first -tier diagnostic \ntest for individuals with developmental disabilities  and delays, including individuals with ASD.   The ISCA \n“strongly supports the use of CMA in place of  G-banded karyotyping as the first -tier cytogenetic \ndiagnostic test for patients with DD/ID, ASD, or MCA. G-banded karyotype analysis should be reserved \nfor patients with obvious chromosomal syndromes (e.g. Down syndrome), a family history of \nchromosomal rearrangement, or a history of multiple miscarriages.” \nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)  \nWithin the 2014 AACAP guidelines, they recommend that “clinicians should coordinate an appropriate \nmultidisciplinary assessment of children w ith ASD … All children with ASD should have a medical \nassessment, which typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a Wood’s lamp examination \nfor signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which may include G -banded karyotype, fragile X \ntesting, or chro mosomal microarray.”  \n \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention  \n The CDC website for recommendations and guidelines for ASD supports the guidelines of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP ).  \n American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n Within the 2013 ACMG guidelines, they recommend that a genetic consultation be offered to all individuals  with ASD as well as their families.  They also recommend the use of a tiered genetic  diagnostic  \nevaluation , consisting of the following:  \n• “First tier  \no Three-generation family history with pedigree analysis  \no Initial evaluation to identify known syndromes or associated conditions  \n Examination with special attention to dysmorphic features  \n If specific syndromic diagnosis is suspected, proceed with targeted testing  \n If appropriate clinical indicators present, perform metabolic and/or mitochondrial testing (alternati vely, consider a referral to a metabolic specialist)  \no Chromosomal microarray: oligonucleotide array -comparative genomic hybridization or single -\nnucleotide polymorphism array  \no DNA testing for fragile X (to be performed routinely for male patients only)\na \n• Second tier  \no MECP2  sequencing to be performed for all females with ASDs  \no MECP2 duplication testing in males, if phenotype is suggestive  \no PTEN  testing only if the head circumference is 2.5 SD above the mean  \no Brain magnetic resonance imagining only in the presence of specific indicators (e.g., microcephaly, regression, se izures, and history of stupor/coma)  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM217 6 Testing for Autism Spectrum Disorder s and Developmental Delay   Page 10 of 14 \naDNA testing for fragile X in females if indicators present (e.g., family history and phenotype). ” \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence  \n \nConcerning genetic testing in the NICE guidelines, they state, “Do not routinely perf orm any medical \ninvestigations as part of an autism diagnostic assessment, but consider the following in individual \ncircumstances and based on physical examination, clinical judgment and the child or young person’s profile : genetic tests, as recommended by your regional genetics centre, if there are specific dysmorphic \nfeatures, congenital anomalies and/or evidence of a learning (intellectual) disability .” \nV.

Syndromic hearing loss refers to hearing loss\nassociated with other medical or physical findings, including visible\nabnormalities of the external ear. Because syndromic hearing loss\noccurs as part of a syndrome of multiple clinical manifestations, it is\noften recognized more readily as hereditary. Nonsyndromic hearing\nloss is defined as hearing loss not associated with other physical\nsigns or symptoms. Nonsyndromic hearing loss accounts for 70% to\n80% of genetically determined deafness, and it is more difficult to\ndetermine whether the etiology is hereditary or acquired.\nThis policy primarily focuses on the use of genetic testing to identify a\ncause of suspected hereditary hearing loss. The diagnosis of\nsyndromic hearing loss can be made on the basis of associated\nclinical findings. However, at the time of hearing loss presentation,\nassociated clinical findings may not be apparent; furthermore,\nvariants in certain genetic loci may cause both syndromic and\nnonsyndromic hearing loss. Given this overlap, the policy focuses on\ngenetic testing for hereditary hearing loss more generally.\nIf there is not a high suspicion for a specific hearing loss etiology,\nideally the evaluation should occur in a stepwise fashion. About 50%\nof individuals with autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss have\npathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene, in the other 50% of patients\nwith apparent autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss;\nnumerous other genes are implicated. There is no single identifiable\ngene responsible for most cases of autosomal dominant hereditary\nhearing loss.\n25. 4. 8. 오후  4:15 Medical Policy | BCBSNE\nhttps://medicalpolicy.nebraskablue.com/Policy/219/9 1/7\n\nIf there is suspicion for autosomal recessive congenital hearing loss,\nit would be reasonable to begin with testing of GJB2 and GJB6 and if\ntesting is negative, screening for the other genes associated with\nhearing loss with a multigene panel would be efficient. An alternative\nstrategy for suspected autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant\nhearing loss would be to obtain a multigene panel that includes GJB2\nand GJB6 as a first step.\nGiven the extreme heterogeneity in genetic causes of hearing loss,\nthese 2 strategies may be considered reasonably equivalent.\nDates\nOriginal Effective\n07-21-2016\nLast R eview\n08-07-2024\nNext R eview\n08-11-2025\nRELATED POLICIES\nThis policy document provides coverage criteria for genetic testing for\nhereditary hearing loss.

Unless clinical and/or family history suggests a specific\ngenetic etiology, comprehensive HL gene panel testing should be\ninitiated.” (p. 9)\nThe guidelines also state the following: “Although nonsyndromic HL\n[hearing loss] demonstrates high genetic heterogeneity, the DFNB1\nlocus, which includes the GJB2 gene encoding the gap junction protein\nconnexin 26 and the GJB6 gene encoding the gap junction protein\nconnexin 30, accounts for an estimated 50% of all autosomal recessive\nnonsyndromic HL and 15% to 40% of all deaf individuals in a variety of\npopulations.” (p. 3)\nGeneReviews: Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness Overview\nGeneReviews is an expert-authored review of current literature on a\ngenetic disease, and goes through a rigorous editing and peer review\nprocess before being published online. \nIn the section that discusses possible differential diagnosis for\nhereditary hearing loss and deafness, it is stated that, In developed\ncountries approximately 65% of prelingual hearing loss is due to\ngenetic causes.  The remainder of cases are due to environmental\n(acquired) causes, which should be differentiated from genetic causes\nto inform the evaluation and required ancillary testing. Acquired\nhearing loss in children commonly results from prenatal infections\nfrom ‘TORCH’ organisms…or postnatal infections (such as CMV).\nAcquired hearing loss in adults is most often attributed to\nenvironmental factors.\nGeneReviews also states that molecular genetic testing includes the\nuse of multigene hearing loss panels and/or genomic testing.  Single-\ngene testing (sequence analysis of a given gene, followed by gene-\ntargeted deletion/duplication analysis) is rarely useful and typically\nNOT recommended. \n25. 4. 8. 오후  4:15 Medical Policy | BCBSNE\nhttps://medicalpolicy.nebraskablue.com/Policy/219/9 4/7\n\nQuick Code Search\nUse this feature to find out if a procedure and diagnosis code pair will be\napproved, denied or held for review.

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results.

Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history.

For further discussion of \nwhat is considered an appropriate panel code, please refer to the guideline \nLaboratory Billing and Reimbursement .\nWhat are hereditary cancer syndromes? \nDefinition\nWhen a mutation in a single gene causes a significantly increased risk for certain \ncancers, it is called a hereditary cancer syndrome. Hereditary cancer syndromes are \nusually characterized by a pattern of specific cancer types occurring together in the \nsame family, younger cancer diagnosis ages than usual, and/or other co-existing non-\ncancer conditions. \nPrevalence \nMost cancer is sporadic and believed to be caused by a mix of behavioral or lifestyle, \nenvironmental, and inherited risk factors. However, about 5-10% of cancers are \nbelieved to have a major inherited component.1 \nHereditary cancer syndromes \nThere are more than 50 hereditary cancer syndromes.1 Some of the most common are \nlisted below with associated cancers.2\nHereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC): breast, ovarian/fallopian \ntube/primary peritoneal cancer, pancreatic, prostate cancers \nLynch syndrome: colorectal, endometrial, small bowel, stomach, ovarian, \npancreatic, ureteral and renal pelvis, biliary tract, brain, sebaceous adenoma, and \nkeratoacanthoma tumors \nFamilial adenomatous polyposis: colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers, \ngastrointestinal tract polyps (adenomas, fundic gland), osteomas, desmoids, thyroid\ncancer and hepatoblastoma \nMUTYH-associated polyposis: colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers, \nadenomas, hyperplastic polyps \nCowden syndrome: benign and malignant tumors of the breast, endometrium, and \nthyroid; cancer and polyps (hamartomas) in the colon and rectum \nLi-Fraumeni syndrome: soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, leukemia, melanoma, \nand cancer of the breast, pancreas, colon, adrenal cortex, stomach, esophagus and\nbrain \n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

For example, breast cancer is a feature of \nHBOC, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Cowden syndrome, and other hereditary cancer \nsyndromes. The pattern of cancers in the family or pathognomonic features may help \ndetermine the underlying syndrome. However, in many cases it can be difficult to \nreliably diagnose hereditary cancer syndromes based on clinical and family history \nalone.\nGenes associated with hereditary cancer syndromes \nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggested specific genes that \nmay contribute to hereditary cancers.3-5 Some of these are are provided in the table \nbelow. \nHereditary cancer type Associated genes\nBreast cancer ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, \nCHEK2, NF1, PALB2, PTEN, RAD51C, \nRAD51D, STK11, TP53 \nColon cancer / polyposis APC, AXIN2, BMPR1A, CHEK2, EPCAM, \nGREM1, MBD4, MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, \nMSH3, MSH6, MUTYH, NTHL1, PMS2, \nPOLD1, POLE, PTEN, SMAD4, STK11, \nTP53 \nOvarian cancer BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, MLH1, MSH2, \nMSH6, PALB2, PMS2, EPCAM, RAD51C, \nRAD51D, and STK11 \nPancreatic cancer ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, EPCAM,\nMLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, \nSTK11, TP53 \nProstate cancer ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, EPCAM, \nMLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2 \nTest information \nIntroduction\nTesting for hereditary cancer syndromes may include multigene panel testing.\n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

NGS panels that test several genes at once are particularly well-suited to \nconditions caused by more than one gene or where there is considerable clinical \noverlap between conditions making it difficult to reliably narrow down likely causes. \nAdditionally, tests should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of identifying mutations \nin the genes of interest, contribute to alterations in management for an individual, and/\nor minimize the chance of finding variants of uncertain clinical significance. \nGuidelines and evidence \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG has published \nseveral statements or standards that offer general guidance on the clinical application \nof large-scale sequencing, including recommendations regarding counseling around \nunexpected results, variants of unknown significance, and minimum requirements for \nreporting apply to many NGS applications.6-8 \nACMG (2021) published a technical standard for use of NGS in the clinical laboratories\nwhich stated:7\n“Choosing an appropriate NGS-based test is the responsibility of the ordering \nhealth-care provider. Given the large number of tests (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\ngtr/) available to the clinician, the clinical laboratory often provides critical advice in \ntest selection. Ordering providers must weigh considerations of sensitivity, \nspecificity, cost, and turnaround time for each clinical situation.”  \n“Test development must consider the variant types that will be detected in the \ngenes or regions of the genome interrogated.”  \nIn a 2020 technical standard on gene sequencing panels, ACMG stated:8\n“Gene sequencing panels are a powerful diagnostic tool for many clinical \npresentations associated with genetic disorders. Advances in DNA sequencing \ntechnology have made gene panels more economical, flexible, and efficient.”  \n“Due to differences in decision-making processes in the absence of clear \nprofessional standards, genes included on similar disease-focused panels vary \nbetween laboratories. With the ability to sequence multiple genes  simultaneously, it\nis imperative to evaluate critically the validity of gene–disease associations prior to \ntest design.” \n“Transparency is imperative when performing a gene sequencing panel so that \nordering providers know what the test includes and what it does not.”  \nGene panels should:\n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \nIn a Committee Opinion, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n(ACOG, 2019) stated:10\n“If a hereditary cancer risk assessment suggests an increased risk of a hereditary \ncancer syndrome, referral to a specialist in cancer genetics or a health care \nprovider with expertise in genetics is recommended for expanded gathering of \nfamily history information, risk assessment, education, and counseling, which may \nlead to genetic testing and tailored cancer screening or risk reduction measures, or \nboth.” \n“Genetic testing may be performed using a panel of multiple genes through next-\ngeneration sequencing technology. This multigene testing process increases the \nlikelihood of finding variants of unknown significance, and it also allows for testing \nfor pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in multiple genes that may be \nassociated with a specific cancer syndrome or family cancer phenotype (or multiple \nphenotypes).” \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (2019) published a consensus guideline on \ngenetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:11\n“Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.”  \n“Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Every patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic \ntesting in the past and no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated \nand updated testing considered. In particular, a patient who had negative germline \nBRCA1 and 2 testing, who is from a family with no pathogenic variants, should be \nconsidered for additional testing. Genetic testing performed prior to 2014 most likely\nwould not have had PALB2 or other potentially relevant genes included and may \nnot have included testing for large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 or BRCA2.”  \n“Genetic testing should be made available to patients without a history of breast \ncancer who meet NCCN guidelines. Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results. It is also reasonable to order a multi-gene panel if \nthe family history is incomplete (i.e., a case of adoption, patient is uncertain of exact\ntype of cancer affecting family members, among others) or other cancers are found \nin the family history, as described above.”  \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology \nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 2024) published the following \nrecommendations on germline genetic testing panels in individuals with cancer:12\n\"Patients should have a family history taken and recorded that includes details of \ncancers in first- and second-degree relatives and the patient's ethnicity.\" \n\"When more than one gene is relevant based on personal and/or family history, \nmultigene panel testing should be offered.\" \nASCO provided information on genes that were more strongly recommended and \nthose that were less strongly recommended based on cancer type.

For this reason, \nthe NCCN panel recommends that multi-gene testing be offered in the context of \nprofessional genetic expertise, with pre- and post-test counseling being offered.”  4 \n\"An individual's personal and/or family history may be explained by more than one \ninherited cancer syndrome; thus, phenotype-directed testing based on personal and\nfamily history through a tailored multi-gene panel test is often more efficient and \ncost-effective and increases the yield of detecting a P/LP variant in a gene that will \nimpact medical management for the individual or their family members with \nincreased risk.\"3 \n\"There may also be a role for multi-gene testing in individuals who have tested \nnegative for a single syndrome, but whose personal or family history remains \nsuggestive of an inherited susceptibility.\"3 \n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

Not all genes included on available multi-gene tests will change risk \nmanagement compared to that based on other risk factors such as family history.”  3 \n“P/LP variants in many breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer \nsusceptibility genes involved in DNA repair may be associated with rare autosomal \nrecessive conditions, thus posing risks to offspring to offspring if the partner is also \na carrier.” 3 \n“As more genes are tested, there is an increased likelihood of finding variants of \nunknown significance (VUS), mosaicism, and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate\npotential (CHIP).”  3 \n\"It may be possible to refine risks associated with both moderate and high-\npenetrance genes, taking into account the influence of gene/gene or \ngene/environment interactions. In addition, certain P/LP variants in a gene may \npose higher or lower risk than other P/LP variants in that same gene. This \ninformation should be taken into consideration when assigning risks and \nmanagement recommendations for individuals and their relatives who also have \nincreased risk.\"3 \nNCCN Practice Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal \n(2023) stated the following regarding multigene panel testing:4\n“The introduction of multigene testing for hereditary forms of cancer has rapidly \naltered the clinical approach to testing affected patients and their families. Based on\nNGS technology, these tests simultaneously analyze a set of genes that are \nassociated with a specific family cancer phenotype or multiple phenotypes.”  \n\"When more than one gene can explain an inherited cancer syndrome, multigene \ntesting is more efficient than single-gene testing, or sequential single syndrome \ntesting.\" \n\"Chances of finding a VUS or pathogenic variant with uncertain clinical \nmanagement increase as the number of genes included in the multigene panel \nincrease.\"\n“There is also a role for multigene testing in individuals who have tested negative \n(indeterminate) for a single syndrome, but whose personal or family history remains\nstrongly suggestive of an inherited susceptibility.”  \n“As is the case with high-risk genes, it is possible that the risks associated with \nmoderate-risk genes may not be entirely due to that gene alone, but may be \ninfluenced by gene/gene or gene/environment interactions.

Therefore, it may be difficult to use a known pathogenic \nvariant alone to assign risk for relatives.”  \n\"In many cases, diagnosing mutations in moderate-penetrance genes does not \nchange management compared to management based on family history alone.\" \n\"It is for these and other reasons that multigene testing is ideally offered in the \ncontext of professional genetic expertise for pre- and post-test counseling. \nIndividuals with the recommended expertise include certified genetic counselors, as\nwell as clinicians who have had extensive training and/or experience in \nidentification and management of hereditary syndromes.\"\n\"Multi-gene testing may be preferred, particularly for patients with a strong family \nhistory or if the age of CRC diagnosis is less than 50 years.\"\nGermline multigene testing that “includes all polyposis and colorectal cancer genes”\nis preferred for the following individuals when there is no known pathogenic variants\nin any polyposis gene in the family:\no“Personal history of 20 or more cumulative adenomas”  \no“Multifocal/bilateral congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium \n(CHRPE)” \no“Consider testing if a personal history of between 10-19 cumulative adenomas, \ndesmoid tumor, hepatoblastoma, cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid \ncancer, unilateral CHRPE, if individual meets criteria for SPS [Serrated \nPolyposis Syndrome] with at least some adenomas, [or] family history of \npolyposis and family unwilling/unable to have testing.”  \nNCCN Practice Guidelines for Prostate Cancer (2024) stated the following regarding \nmultigene panel testing:5\n\"If criteria are met, germline multigene testing that includes at least BRCA1, \nBRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is \nrecommended.\" \nGermline genetic testing is recommended for all men with high-risk, very-high-risk, \nregional (node positive), or metastatic prostate cancer.3,5 \nNCCN Practice Guidelines for Cutaneous Melanoma (2024) stated the following \nregarding multigene panel testing:14\n“Multigene panel testing that includes CDKN2A is recommended for patients with \ninvasive cutaneous melanoma who have a first degree relative diagnosed with \npancreatic cancer.”  \n“Testing other genes that can harbor melanoma-predisposing mutations may be \nwarranted.” \nNCCN Practice Guidelines for Kidney Cancer (2025) published criteria for further \n©2024 EviCore healthcare.

The guideline stated\nthe following regarding multigene panel testing for individuals with no mutation \nidentified in a family member and who have features of a hereditary renal cancer \nsyndrome or who meet criteria as outlined in the guideline:15 \n\"Consider testing of individuals with kidney cancer-focused multi-gene panel or \nclinically directed single-gene testing.\"\nNCCN Practice Guidelines for Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors (2024) published \ncriteria for genetic testing and stated the following regarding multigene panel testing:16\n\"The introduction of multigene testing for hereditary endocrine neoplasia syndromes\nhas rapidly altered the clinical approach to genetic testing of patients.\" \n\"Given the possible overlap in clinical presentation amongst hereditary endocrine \nneoplasias, multigene panel testing may be more efficient and cost-effective in \nmany situations.\" \nThis guideline also addressed the differences that may be present in commercially \navailable tests and the importance of considering the indication for testing and the \nexpertise of the laboratory when considering multigene panel testing. \nAdditionally, the guideline stated that testing of unaffected individuals can be \nconsidered when an affected family member is unable or unwilling to be tested. Per \nthe guideline, pre-test genetic counseling should include a discussion of the \npotential difficulties with interpreting test results in this scenario. \nFor individuals with likely pathogenic mutations, these are managed similar to \npathogenic mutations. For individuals with a VUS, likely benign, or negative results, \nmanagement is directed based on the cancers/tumors in the individual and family \nmembers. \nNote  This benefit/harm statement only applies to those jurisdictions that do not have \nMedicare guidance. Based upon the guidelines and evidence provided in the clinical \npolicy, following EviCore's criteria for hereditary cancer syndrome multigene panels \nwill ensure that testing will be available to those members most likely to benefit from a\ngenetic diagnosis. For those not meeting criteria, it ensures alternate diagnostic \nstrategies are considered. However, it is possible that some members who would \nbenefit from the testing, but do not meet clinical criteria, will not receive an immediate \napproval for testing.\nReferences \n1.National Cancer Institute.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

The WGS  was performed  in \n‘rapid  run’ mode  with  a minimum  depth  of 90 Gb per genome  and average  depth  of coverage  of 40-fold.  \nFor rapid  WES  or WGS,  the individual  should  be critically  ill and in the neonatal  or pediatric  intensive  \ncare  units  (NICU,  PICU)  when  the test is ordered  but may  be discharged  before  results  are delivered.  \nCopy  number  variation  (CNV)  analysis  should  be performed  in parallel  with  rWGS  using  chromosomal  \nmicroarray  analysis  (CMA)  or directly  within  rWGS  if the test is validated  for CNV  analysis.  \nExamples  of specific  malformations  highly  suggestive  of a genetic  etiology,  include  but are not limited  to \nany of the following:  \n• Choanal  atresia  \n• Coloboma  \n• Hirschsprung  disease  \n• Meconium  ileus  \nExamples  of an abnormal  laboratory  test suggesting  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype,  \ninclude  but are not limited  to any of the following:  \n• Abnormal  newborn  screen  \n• Conjugated  hyperbilirubinemia  not due to total  parental  nutrition  (TPN)  cholestasis  \n• Hyperammonemia  \n• Lactic  acidosis  not due to poor  perfusion  \n• Refractory  or severe  hypoglycemia  \nExamples  of clinical  features  suggesting  a genetic  disease  include  but are not limited  to any of the \nfollowing:  \n• Significant  hypotonia.  \n• Persistent  seizures.  \n• Infant  with  high  risk stratification  on evaluation  for a Brief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  (BRUE)  \n(see  below)  with  any of the following  features:  \no Recurrent  events  without  respiratory  infection  \no Recurrent  witnessed  seizure  like events  \no Required  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  \no Significantly  abnormal  chemistry  including  but not limited  to electrolytes,  bicarbonate  \nor lactic  acid,  venous  blood  gas, glucose,  or other  tests  that suggest  an inborn  error  of \nmetabolism  \n• Significantly  abnormal  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  including  but not limited  to possible  \nchannelopathies,  arrhythmias,  cardiomyopathies,  myocarditis,  or structural  heart  disease  \n• Family  history  of: \no Arrhythmia  \no BRUE  in sibling  \no Developmental  delay  \no Inborn  error  of metabolism  or genetic  disease  \no Long  QT syndrome  (LQTS)  \no Sudden  unexplained  death  (including  unexplained  car accident  or drowning)  in first- or \nsecond -degree  family  members  before  age 35, and particularly  as an infant  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   4 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  was previously  known  as Apparent  Life Threatening  Event  (ALTE).  In a \npractice  guideline  from  the American  Academy  of Pediatrics  (AAP),  BRUE  is defined  as an event  \noccurring  in an infant  younger  than  1 year  of age when  the observer  reports  a sudden,  brief  (usually  less \nthan  one minute),  and now  resolved  episode  of one or more  of the following:  \n• Absent,  decreased,  or irregular  breathing  \n• Altered  level  of responsiveness  \n• Cyanosis  or pallor  \n• Marked  change  in tone  (hyper - or hypotonia)  \nA BRUE  is diagnosed  only  when  there  is no explanation  for a qualifying  event  after  conducting  an \nappropriate  history  and physical  examination.  \nNote:  More  information  is available  at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590   \nTrio Testing  \nThe recommended  option  for testing  when  possible  is testing  of the child  and both  parents  (trio  testing).  \nTrio testing  increases  the chance  of finding  a definitive  diagnosis  and reduces  false -positive  findings.  \nTrio testing  is preferred  whenever  possible  but should  not delay  testing  of a critically  ill individual  when  \nrapid  testing  is indicated.  Testing  of one available  parent  should  be done  if both  are not immediately  \navailable  and one or both  parents  can be done  later  if needed.  \nGenetics  Nomenclature  Update  \nThe Human  Genome  Variation  Society  nomenclature  is used  to report  information  on variants  found  in \nDNA  and serves  as an international  standard  in DNA  diagnostics.  It is being  implemented  for genetic  \ntesting  medical  evidence  review  updates  starting  in 2017  (see Table  PG1).  The Society's  nomenclature  is \nrecommended  by the Human  Variome  Project,  the Human  Genome  Organisation,  and by the Human  \nGenome  Variation  Society  itself.  \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  and the Association  for Molecular  Pathology  \nstandards  and guidelines  for interpretation  of sequence  variants  represent  expert  opinion  from  both  \norganizations,  in addition  to the College  of American  Pathologists.  These  recommendations  primarily  \napply  to genetic  tests  used  in clinical  laboratories,  including  genotyping,  single  genes,  panels,  exomes,  \nand genomes.

The interpretation  of the results  of genetic  tests  and the understanding  of risk factors  can \nbe very  difficult  and complex.  Therefore,  genetic  counseling  will assist  individuals  in understanding  the \npossible  benefits  and harms  of genetic  testing,  including  the possible  impact  of the information  on the \nindividual's  family.  Genetic  counseling  may  alter  the utilization  of genetic  testing  substantially  and may  \nreduce  inappropriate  testing.  Genetic  counseling  should  be performed  by an individual  with  experience  \nand expertise  in genetic  medicine  and genetic  testing  methods.  \nCoding  \nSee the Codes  table  for details.  \nBENEFIT  APPLICATION  \nBlue  Card/National  Account  Issues  \nSome  Plans  may  have  contract  or benefit  exclusions  for genetic  testing.  \nBenefit  Exceptions  \nThis policy  may  not apply  to all lines  of business  such  as the Federal  Employee  Program,  Medicare  \nSupplement,  Medicare  Advantage,  Medicaid,  and certain  self-insured  groups.  \nBACKGROUND  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  (WES)  is targeted  next -generation  sequencing  (NGS)  of the subset  of the \nhuman  genome  that contains  functionally  important  sequences  of protein -coding  DNA,  while  whole  \ngenome  sequencing  (WGS)  uses  NGS  techniques  to sequence  both  coding  and noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  Whole  exome  sequencing  and WGS  have  been  proposed  for use in patients  presenting  with  \ndisorders  and anomalies  not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  Potential  candidates  for WES  and \nWGS  include  patients  who  present  with  a broad  spectrum  of suspected  genetic  conditions.  \nGiven  the variety  of disorders  and management  approaches,  there  are a variety  of potential  health  \noutcomes  from  a definitive  diagnosis.  In general,  the outcomes  of a molecular  genetic  diagnosis  include  \n(1) impacting  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) informing  follow -up that can benefit  a child  by reducing  \nmorbidity,  and (3) affecting  reproductive  planning  for parents  and potentially  the affected  patient.  \nThe standard  diagnostic  workup  for patients  with  suspected  Mendelian  disorders  may  include  \ncombinations  of radiographic,  electrophysiologic,  biochemical,  biopsy,  and targeted  genetic  \nevaluations.1, The search  for a diagnosis  may  thus  become  a time -consuming  and expensive  process.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  Technology  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  using  NGS  technology  can facilitate  obtaining  a genetic  diagnosis  in \npatients  efficiently.  Whole  exome  sequencing  is limited  to most  of the protein -coding  sequence  of an \nindividual  (»85%),  is composed  of about  20,000  genes  and 180,000  exons  (protein -coding  segments  of a \ngene),  and constitutes  approximately  1% of the genome.  It is believed  that the exome  contains  about  \n85%  of heritable  disease -causing  variants.  Whole  exome  sequencing  has the advantage  of speed  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   6 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nefficiency  relative  to Sanger  sequencing  of multiple  genes.  Whole  exome  sequencing  shares  some  \nlimitations  with  Sanger  sequencing.  For example,  it will not identify  the following:  intronic  sequences  or \ngene  regulatory  regions;  chromosomal  changes;  large  deletions;  duplications;  or rearrangements  within  \ngenes,  nucleotide  repeats,  or epigenetic  changes.  Whole  genome  sequencing  uses  techniques  similar  to \nWES  but includes  noncoding  regions.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has a greater  ability  to detect  large  \ndeletions  or duplications  in protein -coding  regions  compared  with  WES  but requires  greater  data  \nanalytics.  \nTechnical  aspects  of WES  and WGS  are evolving,  including  the development  of databases  such  as the \nNational  Institutes  of Health’s  ClinVar  database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to catalog  \nvariants,  uneven  sequencing  coverage,  gaps  in exon  capture  before  sequencing,  and difficulties  with  \nnarrowing  the large  initial  number  of variants  to manageable  numbers  without  losing  likely  candidate  \ndisease -associated  variants.  The variability  contributed  by the different  platforms  and procedures  used  \nby different  clinical  laboratories  offering  exome  sequencing  as a clinical  service  is unknown.  \nIn 2013,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics,  Association  for Molecular  Pathology,  \nand College  of American  Pathologists  convened  a workgroup  to standardize  terminology  for describing  \nsequence  variants.  In 2015,  guidelines  developed  by this workgroup  describe  criteria  for classifying  \npathogenic  and benign  sequence  variants  based  on 5 categories  of data:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  \nuncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and benign.2, \nRegulatory  Status  \nClinical  laboratories  may  develop  and validate  tests  in-house  and market  them  as a laboratory  service;  \nlaboratory -developed  tests  must  meet  the general  regulatory  standards  of the Clinical  Laboratory  \nImprovement  Amendments  (CLIA).  Whole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  tests  as a clinical  service  are \navailable  under  the auspices  of the CLIA.  Laboratories  that offer  laboratory -developed  tests  must  be \nlicensed  by the CLIA  for high -complexity  testing.  To date,  the U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  \nhas chosen  not to require  any regulatory  review  of this test.  \nRATIONALE  \nThis evidence  review  was created  in September  2013  with  searches  of the PubMed  database.  The most  \nrecent  literature  update  was performed  through  January 6, 2025 . \nEvidence  reviews  assess  whether  a medical  test is clinically  useful.  A useful  test provides  information  to \nmake  a clinical  management  decision  that improves  the net health  outcome.  That  is, the balance  of \nbenefits  and harms  is better  when  the test is used  to manage  the condition  than  when  another  test or \nno test is used  to manage  the condition.  \nThe first step  in assessing  a medical  test is to formulate  the clinical  context  and purpose  of the test.  The \ntest must  be technically  reliable,  clinically  valid,  and clinically  useful  for that purpose.  Evidence  reviews  \nassess  the evidence  on whether  a test is clinically  valid  and clinically  useful.  Technical  reliability  is \noutside  the scope  of these  reviews,  and credible  information  on technical  reliability  is available  from  \nother  sources.  \nThis review  was informed  in part by a TEC Special  Report  (2013)  on exome  sequencing  for patients  with  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders.3, \nIn 2018,  Smith  et al reported  a scoping  review  of genome  and exome  sequencing  as a diagnostic  tool for \npediatric  patients.  4, The authors  identified  171 publications,  although  131 were  case  reports.  They  \nconcluded  that diagnostic  yield  was the only  consistently  reported  outcome.  The median  diagnostic  \nyield  in publications  including  more  than  single  case  reports  was 33%  but varied  by broad  clinical  \ncategories  and test type.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   7 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe following  sections  review  evidence  by test type  (whole  exome  sequencing  [WES]  and whole  genome  \nsequencing  [WGS]),  broad  type  of disorder,  and care  setting  (intensive  care  vs. not intensive  care).  \nPromotion  of greater  diversity  and inclusion  in clinical  research  of historically  marginalized  groups  (e.g.,  \nPeople  of Color  [African -American,  Asian,  Black,  Latino  and Native  American];  LGBTQIA  (Lesbian,  Gay,  \nBisexual,  Transgender,  Queer,  Intersex,  Asexual);  Women;  and People  with  Disabilities  [Physical  and \nInvisible])  allows  policy  populations  to be more  reflective  of and findings  more  applicable  to our diverse  \nmembers.  While  we also strive  to use inclusive  language  related  to these  groups  in our policies,  use of \ngender -specific  nouns  (e.g.,  women,  men,  sisters,  etc.)  will continue  when  reflective  of language  used  in \npublications  describing  study  populations.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  \nDisorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WES  in children  who  have  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  workup  is to establish  a \nmolecular  diagnosis.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  \nbe considered  clinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that are suspected  to have  a genetic  basis,  but are not \nexplained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or \na neurodevelopmental  disorder:  standard  clinical  workup  without  WES.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   8 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nA number  of studies  have  reported  on the use of WES  in clinical  practice  (Table  1). Typically,  the \npopulations  included  in these  studies  have  had suspected  rare genetic  disorders,  although  the specific  \npopulations  vary.  \nSeries  have  been  reported  with  as many  as 2000  patients.  The most  common  reason  for referral  to a \ntertiary  care  center  was an unexplained  neurodevelopmental  disorder.  Many  patients  had been  through  \na standard  clinical  workup  and testing  without  identification  of a genetic  variant  to explain  their  \ncondition.  Diagnostic  yield  in these  studies,  defined  as the proportion  of tested  patients  with  clinically  \nrelevant  genomic  anomalies,  ranged  from  25%  to 48%.  Because  there  is no reference  standard  for the \ndiagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  strategies,  clinical  confirmation  may  be the \nonly  method  for determining  false -positive  and false -negative  rates.  No reports  were  identified  of \nincorrect  diagnoses,  and how  often  they  might  occur  is unclear.  \nWhen  used  as a first-line test in infants  with  multiple  congenital  anomalies  and dysmorphic  features,  \ndiagnostic  yield  may  be as high  as 58%.  Testing  parent -child  trios  has been  reported  to increase  \ndiagnostic  yield,  to identify  an inherited  variant  from  an unaffected  parent  and be considered  benign,  or \nto identify  a de novo  variant  not present  in an unaffected  parent.  First -line trio testing  for children  with  \ncomplex  neurologic  disorders  was shown  to increase  the diagnostic  yield  (29%,  plus a possible  diagnostic  \nfinding  in 27%)  compared  with  a standard  clinical  pathway  (7%)  performed  in parallel  in the same  \npatients.5, \nTable  1.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs).  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WES  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nCohort  studies  following  children  from  presentation  to outcomes  have  not been  reported.  There  are \nconsiderable  challenges  conducting  studies  of sufficient  size given  underlying  genetic  heterogeneity,  and \nincluding  follow -up adequate  to observe  final  health  outcomes.  Studies  addressing  clinical  utility  have  \nreported  mainly  diagnostic  yield  and management  changes.  Thus,  it is difficult  to quantify  lower  or \nupper  bounds  for any potential  improvement  in the net health  outcome  owing  in part to the \nheterogeneity  of disorders,  rarity,  and outcome  importance  that may  differ  according  to identified  \npathogenic  variants.  Actionable  items  following  testing  in the reviewed  studies  (Table  1) included  family  \nplanning,  change  in management,  change  or avoidance  of additional  testing,  surveillance  for associated  \nmorbidities,  prognosis,  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nThe evidence  reviewed  here  reflects  the accompanying  uncertainty,  but supports  a perspective  that \nidentifying  a pathogenic  variant  can (1) impact  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) inform  follow -up that can \nbenefit  a child  by reducing  morbidity  and rarely  potential  mortality,  and (3) affect  reproductive  planning  \nfor parents  and later,  potentially  the affected  child.  When  recurrence  risk can be estimated  for an \nidentified  variant  (e.g., by including  parent  testing),  future  reproductive  decisions  can be affected.

Comparative  studies  have  reported  an increase  in \ndiagnostic  yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Thus,  for individuals  who  have  a suspected  \ngenetic  etiology  but for whom  the specific  genetic  alteration  is unclear  or unidentified  by a standard  \nclinical  workup,  WES  may  return  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  A genetic  diagnosis  for these  patients  is \nreported  to change  management,  including  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  \nending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  for Children  with  a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  other  than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  \nWorkup;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nMost  of the literature  on WES  is on neurodevelopmental  disorders  in children;  however,  other  potential  \nindications  for WES  have  been  reported  (Table  2). These  include  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy,  \ninherited  retinal  disease,  and other  disorders  including  mitochondrial,  endocrine,  and immunologic  \ndisorders.  \nThe purpose  of WES  in patients  who  have  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or \nheritable  disorder  may  be considered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  a disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that is suspected  to have  a genetic  \nbasis  but is not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  \nmultiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder:  a standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  \nvaries  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  \ndysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and \nimaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  \nfor that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   13 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies,  therefore  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nStudies  have  assessed  WES  for a broad  spectrum  of disorders.  The diagnostic  yield  in patient  \npopulations  restricted  to specific  phenotypes  ranges  from  3% for colorectal  cancer  to 60%  for \nunexplained  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  (Table  2). Some  studies  used  a virtual  gene  panel  that is \nrestricted  to genes  associated  with  the phenotype,  while  others  have  examined  the whole  exome,  either  \ninitially  or sequentially.  An advantage  of WES  over  individual  gene  or gene  panel  testing  is that the \nstored  data  allows  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  Whole  exome  \nsequencing  has also been  reported  to be beneficial  in patients  with  atypical  presentations.  \nTable  2.

Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WES  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nA genetic  diagnosis  for an unexplained  disorder  can alter  management  in several  ways:  such  a diagnosis  \nmay  lead  to genetic  counseling  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and may  affect  reproductive  decision  \nmaking.  \nBecause  the clinical  validity  of WES  for this indication  has not been  established,  a chain  of evidence  \ncannot  be constructed.  \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder  \nThere  is an increasing  number  of reports  assessing  use of WES  to identify  a molecular  basis  for disorders  \nother  than  multiple  congenital  anomalies  or neurodevelopmental  disorders.  The diagnostic  yields  in \nthese  studies  ranged  from  3% for colorectal  cancer  to 60%  for trio (parents  and child)  analysis  of limb -\ngirdle  muscular  dystrophy.  Some  studies  have  reported  on the use of a virtual  gene  panel  with  restricted  \nanalysis  of disease -associated  genes,  and the authors  noted  that WES  data  allow  reanalysis  as new  \ngenes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for \nany specific  disorder,  and study  of WES  in these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  \nchanges  in patient  management.  \nRepeat  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test,  in individuals  who  have  \npreviously  received  WES  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  \nThe criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be considered  \nclinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   18 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test.  \nRepeat  WES  is intended  to be used  after  a WES  test has been  performed  without  establishing  a \ndiagnosis.  Repeat  testing  could  lead  to a diagnosis  in a previously  undiagnosed  individual  as new  \npathogenic  genes  or variants  are identified  or new  diagnostic  technologies  are developed.  Additionally,  \ntesting  strategies  might  be revised  based  on the emergence  of new  clinical  features  as a child  develops  \nor the identification  of congenital  anomalies  or developmental  disorders  in additional  family  members.  \nComparators  \nThe comparators  of interest  for this indication  are no further  molecular  testing  following  an initial  WES  \ntest,  and WGS  following  an initial  WES  test.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of individuals  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  individual.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of repeat  WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  of repeat  WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nSystematic  Review  \nDai et al (2022)  conducted  a systematic  review  to determine  the diagnostic  yield  of sequencing  \nreanalysis  of data  from  cases  with  no diagnosis  following  an initial  WES  or WGS  test (Table  5).33,The \nprimary  measure  of efficacy  was the proportion  of undiagnosed  individuals  reaching  a positive  diagnosis  \non reanalysis  after  first round  sequencing  and analysis.  Results  are summarized  in Table  6. The overall  \ndiagnostic  yield  was 0.10  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI], 0.06  to 0.13).  Using  the GRADE  framework,  the \ncertainty  of the evidence  for this outcome  was rated  moderate  certainty.  Confidence  in the estimate  \nwas downgraded  due to significant  heterogeneity  across  studies  that could  not be explained  by \nsubgroup  analyses.  The researchers  performed  subgroup  analyses  on the basis  of time  interval  between  \nthe original  analysis  and reanalysis  (<24  months  compared  with  ≥24 months),  sequencing  methodology  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   19 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n(WES  vs. WGS),  study  sample  size (<50,  50 to 100,  >100  patients),  sequencing  of family  members  for \nsegregation  analysis,  whether  research  validation  of novel  variants/genes  were  conducted,  and whether  \nany artificial  intelligence -based  tools  were  used  in variant  curation.

Other  reasons  included  bioinformatic  pipeline  improvements  (3.3%),  laboratory  \nerrors/misinterpretations  (2.8%),  updated  clinical  phenotypes  (2.1%),  copy  number  variants  (1.9%),  and \nadditional  segregation  studies  in relatives  (1.2%).  \nOnly  7 of 29 studies  provided  individual  clinical  information  of sequenced  probands  (e.g.,  diagnosed  \nvariant,  or timing  of reanalysis)  but instead  reported  summary  data  of the overall  population.  There  \nwere  11 studies  that reported  the finding  of variants  of uncertain  significance  (VUS)  and/or  variants  in \nnovel  genes  but only  8 studies  provided  research  evidence  confirming  their  pathogenicity.  Only  3 studies  \ndiscussed  whether  a genetic  diagnosis  led to management  changes,  and the impact  on management  was \nonly  described  in a subgroup  of individuals.  To address  uncertainties  in the evidence,  the review  authors  \nrecommended  best  practices  for future  research  including  detailed  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria,  \ndetailed  clinical  information  on each  case,  clear  documentation  of methodology  used  for initial  and re-\nanalysis,  and reporting  of the rationale  for attribution  of pathogenicity.  \nNonrandomized  Studies  \nTable  7 summarizes  nonrandomized  studies  published  after  the Dai et al (2022)  systematic  review.  The \ndiagnostic  yield  in these  studies  was consistent  with  previous  studies.  Study  limitations  were  similar  to \nthose  identified  in previous  studies  (Tables  8 and 9). \nTable  7.

The net health  outcome  can be \nimproved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  more  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or \ntesting.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of repeat  WES  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  following  an initial  WES  test were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nDue to heterogeneity  and limitations  in individuals  studies,  the evidence  is insufficient  to establish  a \nchain  of evidence  for the clinical  utility  of repeat  WES  testing  in individuals  who  are undiagnosed  \nfollowing  an initial  WES  test.  \nSection  Summary:  Repeat  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  \nIn a systematic  review  of nonrandomized  studies,  re-analysis  of WES  data  resulted  in an 11%  increase  in \ndiagnostic  yield  (95%  CI 8% to 14%)  in individuals  who  were  previously  undiagnosed  via WES.  However,  \nthe evidence  is insufficient  to establish  the clinical  utility  of repeat  testing.  Individual  studies  lacked  \ndetail  on the reasons  for new  diagnoses,  changes  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the \nfrequency  of the identification  of VUS.  Additionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  \nestablished,  and there  are no clear  guidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  \ntesting.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup  or Whole  Exome  \nSequencing;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  is to establish  a \nmolecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the genome.  The criteria  under  \nwhich  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be considered  clinically  useful  are stated  \nabove.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   23 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup.  \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible.  Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  as a \nclinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practices  are currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  A standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS,  and WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  Compared  to Standard  Clinical  Workup  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   24 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  workup  \nin several  observational  studies,  both  prospective  and retrospective.  Studies  are described  in Table  10. \nThe diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has been  between  20%  and 40%.  Additional  indirect  evidence  is available  \nfrom  studies  reporting  diagnostic  yield  of WES  in a similar  population  as summarized  above,  and it is \nreasonable  to expect  that WGS  is likely  to result  in similar  or better  diagnostic  yield  for pathogenic  or \nlikely  pathogenic  variants  as compared  with  WES.  \nTable  10.

Ten studies (ES=9; GS=1), \ncomprising 1905 probands, compared diagnostic rate among pediatric vs adult patients within cohorts, \nfinding pediatric patients had 1.6 -times odds of a diagnosis compared to that of adult patients (95% CI \n1.22 -2.10, I 2 = 0%, P <.01).  \nAcross all age groups, diagnostic rates of whole exome sequencing (0.38; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.40) and \nwhole genome sequencing (0.34; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.38) were similar (p=.1). Within -cohort comparison \nfrom 9 studies (2269 probands) showed 1.2 -times odds of diagnosis by whole genome sequencing over \nwhole exome sequencing (95% CI: 0.79 to 1.83; p=.38).Whole genome sequencing studies identified a \nhigher range of novel genes (GS: 2 -579 novel genes based on 6 studies, 5538 probands vs. ES: 1 -75 novel \ngenes based on 22 studies, 5038 probands). Variants of unknown significance (VUS) had wide ranges for \nboth ES and GS (ES: <1 -59%; GS: 6 -50%; p=.78), with severe heterogeneity in methodology and \nreporting. Overall, VUS showed a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2021.  \nThe quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool was used to assess bias in the included \nstudies. Studies with a low bias ranking in all domains were deemed high -quality and were used in a \nseparate analysis. Among the 22 high -quality studies (4,580 probands), the clinical utility of whole \ngenome sequencing (0.77; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.90) was higher than that of whole exome sequencing (0.44; \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   28 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n95% CI: 0.30 to 0.58) (p<.01). It is unclear if any study compared whole exome sequencing with \nassessment of structural variants versus whole genome sequencing.  \nA 2020  Health  Technology  Assessment  conducted  by Ontario  Health,  with  literature  searches  conducted  \nin January  2019,  included  a comparative  review  of the diagnostic  yield  of WES  and WGS  in children  with  \nunexplained  developmental  disabilities  or multiple  congenital  anomalies.45, The diagnostic  yield  across  \nall studies  was 37%  (95%  CI, 34%  to 40%).  More  studies,  with  an overall  larger  sample  size,  were  \nincluded  in the examination  on WES  (34 studies,  N=9142)  than  on WGS  (9 studies,  N=648).  Confidence  \nintervals  for studies  using  WES  versus  WGS  overlapped  (37%;  95%  CI, 34%  to 40%,  vs. 40%;  95%  CI, 32%  \nto 49%).  Diagnostic  yield  ranged  between  16%  and 73%,  with  variation  attributed  largely  to technology  \nused  and participant  selection.  The overall  quality  of the evidence  was rated  as very  low,  downgraded  \nfor risk of bias,  inconsistency,  indirectness,  and imprecision.  \nIn some  studies  of WGS,  the genes  examined  were  those  previously  associated  with  the phenotype,  \nwhile  other  studies  were  research -based  and conducted  more  exploratory  analysis.  It has been  noted  \nthat genomes  sequenced  with  WGS  are available  for future  review  when  new  variants  associated  with  \nclinical  diseases  are discovered.37, \nStudies  have  shown  that WGS  can detect  more  pathogenic  variants  than  WES,  due to an improvement  in \ndetecting  copy  number  variants,  insertions  and deletions,  intronic  single -nucleotide  variants,  and exonic  \nsingle -nucleotide  variants  in regions  with  poor  coverage  on WES.  A majority  of studies  have  described  \nmethods  for interpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  \nincluded  in the diagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  not reported.  Five studies  included  in the Ontario  \nHealth  Technology  Assessment  review  provided  data  on the yield  of VUS,  with  an overall  yield  of 17%.  \nOnly  1 of the 5 studies  used  WGS,  however.  The review  authors  noted,  \"Whole  genome  sequencing  \nalways  results  in substantially  longer  lists of variants  of unknown  significance  than  whole  exome  \nsequencing  does.  Interpreting  and acting  upon  variants  of unknown  clinical  significance  is the single  \ngreatest  challenge  identified  by clinicians….”45, \nClinically  Useful  \nA test is clinically  useful  if the use of the results  informs  management  decisions  that improve  the net \nhealth  outcome  of care.  The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  or \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WGS  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  outside  of critical  care  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nClinical  validity  is established  based  on the meaningful  diagnostic  yield  associated  with  WGS  when  a \ngenetic  etiology  is uncertain  after  standard  workup.  Studies  on WGS  report  changes  in management  \nthat would  improve  health  outcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as \nthose  with  WES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   29 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup;  Individuals  who  are \nnot Critically  Ill \nWhole  genome  sequencing  has been  studied  in non-critically  ill children  with  congenital  anomalies  and \ndevelopmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup.  The diagnostic  yield  for WGS  \nhas been  reported  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for interpretation  of \nWGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the diagnostic  yield  \nand that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of WGS  is at least  as high  as \nWES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is unclear  if the additional  \nyield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  outcomes.  Further,  while  \nreporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  across  laboratories,  WGS  \nresults  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of this difference  are \nuncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS reclassification  allowing  a \ndiagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the occurrence  of medical  \nmismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well defined,  and provider  \nreluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS identification  by WGS.  As \nsuch,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  utility.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  Congenital  \nAnomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup.  \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible.  Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  The \nmedian  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  \ncondition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   30 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  in several  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective.  Studies  are described  in Table  13. The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has \nbeen  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  studies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  \npopulations  and include  little  information  about  associated  changes  in management  following  genetic  \ndiagnosis.  \nTable  13.

The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has been  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  \nstudies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  populations  and include  little  information  about  \nassociated  changes  in management  following  genetic  diagnosis.  \nRapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of rapid  WES  (rWES)  or rWGS  in critically  ill patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of \nunknown  etiology  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of \nthe genome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe most  common  cause  of death  in neonates  in the United  States  is genetic  disorders.  Currently,  \ncritically  ill neonates  with  suspected  genetic  diseases  are frequently  discharged  or deceased  without  a \ndiagnosis.  There  are thousands  of rare genetic  disorders.  The presentation  of many  of these  disorders  in \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   34 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nneonates  may  be nonspecific  or differ  from  the presentation  in older  patients  and the disorder  may  \nproduce  secondary  involvement  of other  systems  due to the fragility  of the neonate  that obscures  the \nprimary  pathology.  The neonatal  intensive  care  unit (NICU)  treatment  of suspected  genetic  diseases  is \noften  empirical.  Rapid  diagnosis  is critical  for delivery  of interventions  that reduce  morbidity  and \nmortality  in genetic  diseases  for which  treatments  exist.  For many  genetic  diseases  there  is no effective  \ntreatment  and timely  diagnosis  limits  futile  intensive  care.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is critically  ill infants  presenting  with  any of a variety  of disorders  and \nanomalies  suspected  to have  a genetic  basis  but not explained  by a standard  workup.  For example,  \npatients  may  have  a phenotype  that does  not correspond  with  a specific  disorder  for which  a genetic  \ntest targeting  a specific  gene  is available.  Specifically  for critically  ill infants,  the population  would  also \ninclude  patients  for whom  specific  diagnostic  tests  available  for that phenotype  are not accessible  within  \na reasonable  timeframe.  Petrikin  (2018)  identified  critically  ill infants  that are appropriate  for rapid  \ntesting  as meeting  the following  inclusion  criteria:  multiple  congenital  anomalies;  an abnormal  \nlaboratory  test suggests  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype;  an abnormal  response  to \nstandard  therapy  for a major  underlying  condition;  significant  hypotonia;  or persistent  seizures.  \nExclusion  criteria  included:  an infection  with  normal  response  to therapy;  isolated  prematurity;  isolated  \nunconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia;  Hypoxic  Ischemic  Encephalopathy;  confirmed  genetic  diagnosis  \nexplains  illness;  Isolated  Transient  Neonatal  Tachypnea;  or nonviable  neonates.53, \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  \n• rapid  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible  \n• rapid  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible  \nSeveral  laboratories  offer  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rWES  or \nrWGS  or standard  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nIn its 2021  guideline,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  defines  rapid  and \nultrarapid  testing  as 6 to 15 days  and 1 to 3 days,  respectively.54, \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WES  or WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  \ndiagnosis  or screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  a standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  \ngenetic  condition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nOutcomes  of interest  are as described  above  for use of WES  in patients  with  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder.  For critically  ill infants,  rapid  diagnosis  is important;  \ntherefore,  in addition  to the outcomes  described  in the previous  section,  time  to diagnosis  and time  to \ndischarge  are also outcomes  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   35 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOf course,  mortality  is a compelling  outcome.  However,  many  of the conditions  are untreatable  and \ndiagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care  but may  not \nprolong  survival.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of rWES  or rWGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rWES  or rWGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of rWES  and rWGS  has been  studied  in critically  ill children  in multiple  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective,  and in 3 RCTs.  Studies  are described  in Table  16. The RCTs  are \ndiscussed  in more  detail  in the following  ‘clinically  useful’  section.  One study  included  only  infants  with  \ncardiac  defects  and had a diagnostic  yield  of 6% with  WGS.  The remaining  studies  included  \nphenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill infants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%.  \nTable  16.

Details  of the study  are provided  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. Ninety -five infants  were  randomized  to rWES  and 94 to rWGS.  In addition,  24 infants  \nwho  were  gravely  ill received  ultrarapid  WGS  (urWGS).  The initial  Kingsmore  et al (2019)  publication  \nincluded  only  the diagnostic  outcomes.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. 20%,  \nrespectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  Although  the urWGS  was not part of the \nrandomized  portion  of the study,  the proportion  diagnosed  by urWGS  was 11 of 24 (46%)  and time  to \nresult  was a median  of 4.6 days.  The incremental  diagnostic  yield  of reflexing  to trio testing  after  \ninconclusive  proband  analysis  was 0.7%  (1 of 147).  In 2020,  Dimmock  et al reported  results  of the \nprimary  endpoint  of NSIGHT2:  clinician  perception  that rWGS  was useful  and clinician -reported  changes  \nin management.67, Clinicians  provided  perceptions  of the clinical  utility  of diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  \nfor 201 of 213 infants  randomized  (94%).  In 154 (77%)  infants,  diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  was \nperceived  to be useful  or very  useful;  perceptions  of usefulness  did not differ  between  infants  who  \nreceived  rWES  and rWGS,  nor between  urWGS  and rWES/rWGS.  Thirty -two (15%)  of 207 clinician  \nresponses  indicated  that diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  changed  infant  outcomes  (by targeted  \ntreatments  in 21 [10%]  infants,  avoidance  of complications  in 16 [8%],  and institution  of palliative  care  in \n2 [1%]  infants).  Changes  in outcome  did not differ  significantly  between  infants  randomized  to rWES  and \nrWGS,  although  urWGS  was associated  with  a significantly  higher  rate of change  in management  than  \nrWES/rWGS  (63%  vs. 23%;  p=.0001).  \nPetrikin  et al (2018)  reported  on the Prospective  Randomized  Trial  of the Clinical  Utility  of Rapid  Next  \nGeneration  Sequencing  in Acutely  Ill Neonates  (NSIGHT1;  NCT02225522)  RCT of rWGS  to diagnose  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants.53, In brief,  NSIGHT1  was an investigator -initiated  \n(funded  by the National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute  and Eunice  Kennedy  Shriver  National  \nInstitute  of Child  Health  and Human  Development),  blinded,  and pragmatic  trial comparing  trio rWGS  \nwith  standard  genetic  tests  to standard  genetic  tests  alone  with  a primary  outcome  of the proportion  of \nNICU/PICU  infants  receiving  a genetic  diagnosis  within  28 days.  Parents  of patients  and clinicians  were  \nunblinded  after  10 days  and compassionate  cross -over  to rWGS  occurred  in 5 control  patients.  The study  \nwas designed  to enroll  500 patients  in each  group  but was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on \nthe part of study  clinicians  who  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus \ntrio rWGS.  Intention -to-treat  analyses  were  reported,  i.e., crossovers  were  included  in the group  to \nwhich  they  were  randomized.  The trial required  confirmatory  testing  of WGS  results,  which  lengthened  \nthe time  to rWGS  diagnosis  by 7 to 10 days.  Study  characteristics  are shown  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. \nIn the NICUSeq  RCT,  Krantz  et al (2021)  compared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  \nreporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  \nunit (ICU)  with  a suspected  genetic  disease  at 5 sites  in the US.68, In 76%  of cases,  both  parents  were  \navailable  for trio testing.  Overall,  82 of 354 infants  received  a diagnosis  (23%),  with  a higher  yield  in the \n15-day group  (Table  19). The primary  outcome  was change  in management,  measured  at day 60. \nSignificantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  the delayed  \narm (21.1%  vs 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Changes  in management  included  \nsubspecialty  referral  (21 of 354,  6.0%),  changes  to medication  (5 of 354,  1.4%),  therapeutics  specific  to \nthe primary  genetic  etiology  (7 of 354;  2.0%)  and surgical  interventions  (12 of 354;  3.4%).  Survival  and \nlength  of stay did not differ  between  the groups.  \nTable  19.

Studies  on rWGS  report  changes  in management  that would  improve  health  \noutcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as those  with  WES,  including  \navoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  discontinuation  of or \nadditional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  A chain  of evidence  linking  \nmeaningful  improvements  in diagnostic  yield  and changes  in management  expected  to improve  health  \noutcomes  supports  the clinical  value  of WES  and WGS  for critically  ill infants.  \nSection  Summary:  Rapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nFor critically  ill infants,  disease  may  progress  rapidly  and genetic  diagnoses  must  be made  quickly.  \nSeveral  retrospective  and prospective  observational  studies  with  sample  sizes  ranging  from  about  20 to \nmore  than  275 (in total  including  more  than  450 critically  ill infants  or children)  reported  on diagnostic  \nyield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse,  but critically  ill, infants  and had \nyields  between  30%  and 60%  and reports  of changes  in management  such  as avoidance  of invasive  \nprocedures,  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  \ncare.  \nThree  RCTs  have  evaluated  rWGS  in critically  ill infants  or children.  An RCT comparing  trio rWGS  with  \nstandard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants  funded  by the \nNational  Institutes  of Health  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on the part of study  clinicians  \nwho  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus trio rWGS.  The rate of \ngenetic  diagnosis  within  28 days  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; \np=.003)  and the time  to diagnosis  was shorter  (13 days  vs. 107 days;  p=.002).  The age at hospital  \ndischarge  and mortality  rates  were  similar  in the 2 groups.  However,  many  of the conditions  are \nuntreatable  and diagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care,  \nbut may  not prolong  survival.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill infants  with  diseases  \nof unknown  etiology  from  the NICU,  PICU,  and CVICU.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was \nsimilar  (19%  vs. 20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT \ncompared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  \nreturned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an ICU with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  \nSummary  of Evidence  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  receive  whole  \nexome  sequencing  (WES)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  large  case  series  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   47 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nwithin -subject  comparisons.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in \nreproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  Patients  who  have  multiple  congenital  anomalies  \nor a developmental  disorder  with  a suspected  genetic  etiology,  but whose  specific  genetic  alteration  is \nunclear  or unidentified  by a standard  clinical  workup,  may  be left without  a clinical  diagnosis  of their  \ndisorder,  despite  a lengthy  diagnostic  workup.  For a substantial  proportion  of these  patients,  WES  may  \nreturn  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  Several  large  and smaller  series  have  reported  diagnostic  yields  of \nWES  ranging  from  25%  to 60%,  depending  on the individual’s  age,  phenotype,  and previous  workup.  \nOne comparative  study  found  a 44%  increase  in yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Many  \nof the studies  have  also reported  changes  in patient  management,  including  medication  changes,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  The \nevidence  is sufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  \nreceive  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  small  case  series  and prospective  \nresearch  studies.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  \ndecision  making,  and resource  utilization.  There  is an increasing  number  of reports  evaluating  the use of \nWES  to identify  a molecular  basis  for disorders  other  than  multiple  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders.  The diagnostic  yields  in these  studies  range  from  as low as 3% to 60%.  \nSome  studies  have  reported  on the use of a virtual  gene  panel  with  restricted  analysis  of disease -\nassociated  genes,  and WES  data  allow  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  \nOverall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  disorder,  and clinical  use of WES  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  changes  in patient  management.  The \nevidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES  who  receive  repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of \nprevious  test results,  the evidence  includes  nonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  There  is no direct  evidence  of clinical  utility.  In a meta -analysis  of nonrandomized  studies,  re-\nanalysis  of WES  data  resulted  in an 11%  increase  in diagnostic  yield  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI), 8% to \n14%)  in individuals  who  were  previously  undiagnosed  via WES.  Three  nonrandomized  studies  published  \nafter  the meta -analysis  had findings  consistent  with  the meta -analysis.  Conclusions  were  limited  by \nheterogeneity  across  individual  studies  and a lack of detailed  reporting  on reasons  for new  diagnoses,  \nchanges  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the frequency  of the identification  of variants  of \nuncertain  significance  (VUS).  Therefore,  a chain  of evidence  for clinical  utility  cannot  be established.  \nAdditionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  established,  and there  are no clear  \nguidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  testing.  The evidence  is insufficient  to \ndetermine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  or WES  who  \nreceive  whole  genome  sequencing  (WGS)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  \nnonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  \noutcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  In studies  of children  with  \ncongenital  anomalies  and developmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  clinical  workup,  \nthe yield  of WGS  has ranged  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for \ninterpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the \ndiagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  In a systematic  review,  the pooled  (9 \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   48 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nstudies,  N=648)  diagnostic  yield  of WGS  was 40%  (95%  CI, 32%  to 49%).  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of \nWGS  is at least  as high  as WES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is \nunclear  if the additional  yield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  \noutcomes.  Further,  while  reporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  \nacross  laboratories,  WGS  results  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of \nthis difference  are uncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS \nreclassification  allowing  a diagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the \noccurrence  of medical  mismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well \ndefined,  and provider  reluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS \nidentification  by WGS.  As such,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  \nutility.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the \nnet health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  who  receive  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  case  series.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has also been  studied  in other  genetic  conditions  with  yield  \nranging  from  9% to 55%.  Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  \ndisorder,  and clinical  use of WGS  as well as information  regarding  meaningful  changes  in management  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  \nresults  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are critically  ill infants  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  \nfollowing  a standard  workup  who  receive  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  or rapid  WES  (rWES)  with  trio testing  when  \npossible,  the evidence  includes  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and case  series.  Relevant  outcomes  \nare test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  \nOne RCT comparing  rWGS  with  standard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in \ncritically  ill infants  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise.  The rate of genetic  diagnosis  within  28 \ndays  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; p=.003).  Changes  in \nmanagement  due to test results  were  reported  in 41%  (p=.11)  of rWGS  versus  21%  of control  patients;  \nhowever,  73%  of control  subjects  received  broad  genetic  tests  (e.g., next -generation  sequencing  panel  \ntesting,  WES,  or WGS)  as part of standard  testing.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill \ninfants  with  diseases  of unknown  etiology  from  the neonatal  intensive  care  unit,  pediatric  intensive  care  \nunit,  and cardiovascular  intensive  care  unit.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. \n20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT compared  rWGS  \n(test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 \ndays)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  unit with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Several  retrospective  \nand prospective  studies  including  more  than  800 critically  ill infants  and children  in total  have  reported  \non diagnostic  yield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill \ninfants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%  for pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants.  Studies  \nhave  also reported  associated  changes  in patient  management  for patients  receiving  a diagnosis  from  \nrWGS  or rWES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  A chain  \nof evidence  linking  meaningful  improvements  in diagnostic  yield  and changes  in management  expected  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   49 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nto improve  health  outcomes  supports  the clinical  value  of rWGS  or rWES.  The evidence  is sufficient  to \ndetermine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nSUPPLEMENTAL  INFORMATION  \nThe purpose  of the following  information  is to provide  reference  material.  Inclusion  does  not imply  \nendorsement  or alignment  with  the evidence  review  conclusions.  \nPractice  Guidelines  and Position  Statements  \nGuidelines  or position  statements  will be considered  for inclusion  in ‘Supplemental  Information’  if they  \nwere  issued  by, or jointly  by, a US professional  society,  an international  society  with  US representation,  \nor National  Institute  for Health  and Care  Excellence  (NICE).  Priority  will be given  to guidelines  that are \ninformed  by a systematic  review,  include  strength  of evidence  ratings,  and include  a description  of \nmanagement  of conflict  of interest.  \nAmerican  Academy  of Neurology  et al \nIn 2014,  the American  Academy  of Neurology  and American  Association  of Neuromuscular  and \nElectrodiagnostic  Medicine  issued  evidence -based  guidelines  on the diagnosis  and treatment  of limb -\ngirdle  and distal  dystrophies,  which  made  the following  recommendations  (Table  23).69, \nTable  23. Guidelines  on Limb -Girdle  Muscular  Dystrophy  \nRecommendation  LOE \nDiagnosis   \n• For patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy,  clinicians  should  use a clinical  approach  to guide  \ngenetic  diagnosis  based  on the clinical  phenotype,  including  the pattern  of muscle  involvement,  \ninheritance  pattern,  age at onset,  and associated  manifestations  (e.g., early  contractures,  cardiac  \nor respiratory  involvement).  B \n• In patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy  in whom  initial  clinically  directed  genetic  testing  \ndoes  not provide  a diagnosis,  clinicians  may  obtain  genetic  consultation  or perform  parallel  \nsequencing  of targeted  exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -genome  screening,  or next -\ngeneration  sequencing  to identify  the genetic  abnormality.  C \nManagement  of cardiac  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  refer  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  (1) limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  \n(LGMD)1A,  LGMD1B,  LGMD1D,  LGMD1E,  LGMD2C –K, LGMD2M –P, … or (2) muscular  dystrophy  \nwithout  a specific  genetic  diagnosis  for cardiology  evaluation,  including  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  \nand structural  evaluation  (echocardiography  or cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  [MRI]),  even  \nif they  are asymptomatic  from  a cardiac  standpoint,  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• If ECG or structural  cardiac  evaluation  (e.g., echocardiography)  has abnormal  results,  or if the \npatient  has episodes  of syncope,  near -syncope,  or palpitations,  clinicians  should  order  rhythm  \nevaluation  (e.g., Holter  monitor  or event  monitor)  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  palpitations,  symptomatic  or \nasymptomatic  tachycardia  or arrhythmias,  or signs  and symptoms  of cardiac  failure  for cardiology  \nevaluation.  B \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2A,  LGMD2B,  and LGMD2L  for cardiac  \nevaluation  unless  they  develop  overt  cardiac  signs  or symptoms.  B \nManagement  of pulmonary  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  order  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  \ninspiratory/expiratory  force  in the upright  and,  if normal,  supine  positions)  or refer  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  (to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency)  in muscular  dystrophy  patients  at the \ntime  of diagnosis,  or if they  develop  pulmonary  symptoms  later  in their  course.  B \n• In patients  with  a known  high  risk of respiratory  failure  (e.g., those  with  LGMD2I  …), clinicians  \nshould  obtain  periodic  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  inspiratory/expiratory  B \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   50 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nforce  in the upright  position  and,  if normal,  in the supine  position)  or evaluation  by a \npulmonologist  to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency.  \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2B  and LGMD2L  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  unless  they  are symptomatic.  C \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  excessive  daytime  somnolence,  \nnonrestorative  sleep  (e.g., frequent  nocturnal  arousals,  morning  headaches,  excessive  daytime  \nfatigue),  or respiratory  insufficiency  based  on pulmonary  function  tests  for pulmonary  or sleep  \nmedicine  consultation  for consideration  of noninvasive  ventilation  to improve  quality  of life.

States  can define  EHBs  for their  respective  state.  \nStates  vary  on how  they  define  the term  small  group.  In Idaho,  a small  group  employer  is defined  as an \nemployer  with  at least  two but no more  than  fifty eligible  employees  on the first day of the plan  or \ncontract  year,  the majority  of whom  are employed  in Idaho.   Large  group  employers,  whether  they  are \nself-funded  or fully  insured,  are not required  to offer  EHBs,  but may  voluntar ily offer  them.   \nThe ACA requires  any benefit  plan  offering  EHBs  to remove  all dollar  limits  for EHBs.  \nREFERENCES  \n1.

The member has at least  two of the following:   \na) Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss of unknown etiology, or \nb) Symptoms of a complex neurological disorder (e.g., dystonia, \nhemiplegia, spasticity, epilepsy,  myopathy, muscular dystrophy ), or   \nc) Family history suggestive of a genetic etiology, including consanguinity, \nor   \nd) Clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of \nmetabolism , or \ne) Autism, or \nf) Severe neuropsychiatric condition (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, \nTourette syndrome, self -injurious behavior, reverse sleep -wake cycles), or \ng) Period of unexplained developmental regression (unrelated to epilepsy \nor autism).  \n2. Repeat standard genome sequencing is considered investigational . \n3. Standard genome sequencing is considered investigational  for all other indications, including \nscreening asymptomatic/healthy individuals for genetic disorders.  \nNote : When genome sequencing is performed, the mitochondrial genome is assumed to be included as a part of the analysis.  \nBack to top  \nRapid Genome Sequencing  \n1. Rapid genome sequencing  (rGS), with trio testing when possible, is considered medically \nnecessary  when:  \nA. The member is an acutely -ill infant  (12 months o f age or younger) , and  \nB. Alternate etiologies have been considered and ruled out when possible (e.g., \nenvironmental exposure, injury, infection, isolated prematurity ), and \nC. Clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which rapid single -gene or \ntargeted multi -gene panel testing is available , and \nD. The member’s personal and family histories have been evaluated by a Medical Geneticist, \nGenetic Counselor or an Advanced Practice Nurse in Genetics (APGN) , and  \nE. The member meets at least one of the following  clinical findings : \ni. The member has multiple congenital abnormalities (functional and/or structural) \naffecting unrelated organ systems, or \nii. The member has epileptic encephalopathy, or \niii. The member has unexplained epilepsy  \niv. The member has at least  two of the following:   \na) Abnormality affecting at least one organ system , or  \nb) Symptoms of a complex neurological condition  (e.g., dystonia, \nhemiplegia, spasticity, epilepsy, hypotonia , myopathy, muscular dystrophy, \nglobal  developmental delay , intellectual disability ), or   \nc) Family history suggestive of a genetic etiology, including consanguinity , \nor   \nd) Laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism , or    \ne) Abnormal response to standard therapy . \n2. Rapid genome sequencing (rGS) is considered investigational  for all other indications , including \nscreening asymptomatic/healthy individuals for genetic disorders . \nNote : When genome sequencing is performed, the mitochondrial genome is assumed to be included as a part of the analysis.  \n \nDefinitions  \nExome Sequencing (ES) : A genomic technique for sequencing all of the protein -coding regions of genes in the \ngenome (also known as the exome).  \n \nGenome Sequencing (GS) : A genomic technique for sequencing the complete DNA sequence, which includes \nprotein coding as well as non -coding DNA elements.  \n\n \n \nTrio Testing : Testing of the child and both biological/genetic parents and increases the chances of finding a definitive \ndiagnosis, while reducing false -positive findings.  \n \nComparator Exome Sequencing : Used only for comparison with the proband (individual undergoing exome \nsequencing) and is used to inform the pathogenicity of variants. A comparator exome is typically one or both \nbiological/genetic parents to the proband.  \n \nCongenital anomalies : According to ACMG , congenital anomalies  are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident at birth, or \nshortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, health stat us, physical or social \nfunctioning, and typically require medical intervention.  \n \nGlobal d evelopmental delay : When a n individual is slow-to-meet or not reaching milestones in the expected way for \na child’s age in at least two of the areas of development (communication, gross/fine motor, cognition, social -\nemotional, or adaptive skills)  \n \nIntellectual disability  (ID): Defined by the DSM -V as:   \n1. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, \njudgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment and \nindividualized, standardized intelligence testing.  \n2. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural \nstandards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive \ndeficits limit functioning in one or more activities of dai ly life, such as communication, social participation, \nand independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.  \n3. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \n \nExome sequencing (ES) reanalysis : May not be possible in some situations. Sequencing platforms may have \nchanged substantially enough that the performing lab can no longer use the data from the original ES in their pipeline. \nSpecifically, ES reanalysis may not be possible if there have been improvements in technology/chemistry (e.g., new \nmethods for DNA capture and/o r sequencing), bioinformatics advancements, or there is new information regarding \nthe genetic etiology of a condition that could explain the patient’s clinical features and would not have been able to be \ndetected by the previous exome sequencing.  \n \nProducts  \n \nThis information is for most, but not all, HealthPartners plans.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

These mutations, often called “driver” mutations, are becoming increasingly useful for targeted therapy selection, and may give insight into prognosis and treatment response in a subset of cancers.  In addition, molecular analysis of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, in particular, can also aid in making a diagnosis of a specific type of malignancy.  For solid tumors, molecular analysis can be performed via direct testing of the tumor (which is addressed in this policy) or via circulating tumor DNA or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (see Oth\ner Related Policies).  For hematologic malignancies, molecular analysis can be \nperformed on blood samples or bone marrow biopsy samples. \nFor individuals with advanced cancer,  somatic comprehensive genomic profiling offers the \npotential to evaluate a large number of genetic markers in the cancer simultaneously in order to \nprovide potential treatment options beyond the current standard of care. \nWhile the  primary goal of the molecular analysis of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies \nis to identify bioma\nrkers that diagnose or to give prognostic and treatment selection information, \nthis testing also has the potential to uncover clinically relevant germline variations that are \nassociated with a hereditary cancer susceptibility syndrome, and other conditions, if confirmed to be present in the germline. Current tumor testing strategies include tumor -only testing, tumor-\nnormal paired testing with germline va riant subtraction, and tumor- normal paired testing with \nexplicit analysis of a group of genes associated with germline cancer predisposition. This is an evolving area and clear guidelines around the optimal approach for identification and reporting of the presumed germline pathogenic variants (PGPVs) are emerging.  \n\n \nConcert Genetics Oncology: Molecular Analysis of Solid Tum ors and Hematologic \nMalignancies    \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023   \n \n \n   2 \n \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria section.

\n \nNOTES AND DEFINITIONS \n1. Tumor mutation burden  testing is a measurement of mutations  carried by tumor  cells \nand is a predictive biomarker that is being studied to evaluate its association with \nresponse to immunotherapy. \n2. Advanced cancer  is cancer that is unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment. The \ncancer may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or \ndistant parts of the body. Treatment may be given to help shrink the tumor, slow the \ngrowth of cancer cells, or relieve symptoms. \n3. Myeloproliferative Neoplasms  are rare overlapping blood diseases in which the bone \nmarrow makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. \nThere are seven subcategories of myeloproliferative neoplasms:  \n■ Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) \n■ Polycythemia vera (PV) \n■ Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) \n■ Essential thrombocytopenia (ET) \n■ Chronic neutrophilic leukemia  \n\n \nConcert Genetics Oncology: Molecular Analysis of Solid Tumors and Hematologic \nMalignancies   \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023   \n \n \n   29 \n \n■ Chronic eosinophilic leukemia \n■ Chronic eosinophilic leukemia-not otherwise specified \n■ MPN, unclassifiable (MPN- U) \nback to top \n \nCLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS \nClinical decision making should not be made based on variants of uncertain significance. \nNCCN and ASCO recommend that all individuals diagnosed with ovarian cancer, fallopian tube \ncancer, or primary peritoneal cancer have germline and somatic tumor testing (if not previously \nperformed) for BRCA1  and BRCA2 mutations. \nThe genetic testing of tumors and hematologic malignancies (somatic mutation profiling) may \nreveal incidental germline findings or suspicion of a clinically significant germline mutation. \nProviders should communicate the potential for these incidental findings with their patients prior \nto somatic mutation profiling.  \nACMG (2020) recognized that tumor testing is an emerging area and that the identification of \npresumed germline pathogenic variants (PGPVs) have profound health and reproductive \nimplications for the individual with cancer as well as their family members. Thus, individuals \nundergoing tumor testing should be informed prior to testing that a germline variant may be \nuncovered. PGPVs should be carefully evaluated, confirmed, and reported when tumor testing is \nperformed. Currently, there is a lack of evidence for best practices to report PGPVs to patients \nwho want them. \nback to top \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nTumor-Type Agnostic Solid Tumor Molecular Profiling Panel Tests \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) \nThe NCCN guidelines on Breast Cancer (2.2023) recommend comprehensive somatic testing to \naid in clinical management of patients with recurrent/stage IV breast cancer.

BINV-18)  \n\n \nConcert Genetics Oncology: Molecular Analysis of Solid Tumors and Hematologic \nMalignancies   \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023   \n \n \n   30 \n \nThe NCCN guideline on Occult Primary (3.2023) recommends MSI and MMR testing as part of \nthe initial work up for patients with cancer of unknown primary. The guideline further \nrecommends consideration of NGS to identify actionable genomic aberrations after a histological \ndetermination of the tumor has been made. (p. OCC-1). \nThe NCCN guideline on Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (2.2023) recommends molecular testing \nfor advanced or metastatic disease, including EGFR, ALK, KRAS, ROS1, BRAF, NTRK1/2/3 , \nMET ex14 skipping, RET, PD- L1. They also recommend broader molecular profiling with the \ngoal of identifying rare driver mutations for which effective drugs may already be available. (p. \nNSCL-18). The guidelines also state that repeat somatic genetic testing can be helpful to aid in \ndeciding next therapeutic steps when a patient’s tumor shows evidence of progression on first -\nline therapy. (p. NSCL-H 6 of 7) \nThe NCCN guideline for Colon Cancer (3.2022) recommends all patients with metastatic \ncolorectal cancer have tumor genotyping for KRAS, NRAS, BRAF  individually or as part of an \nNGS panel. Testing can be performed on the primary tumor and/or metastases (p. COL-B 4 of \n8). \nThe NCCN guideline for Gastric Cancer (2.2022) recommends that patients with inoperable \nlocally advanced, recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach considering \ntrastuzumab therapy have IHC for HER2  and NGS when limited diagnostic tissue is available or \npatient can't undergo a traditional biopsy. The guidelines also recommend that repeat tumor \ntesting can be considered when there is clinical or radiologic evidence for disease progression of \nadvanced gastric cancer (p. GAST-B 3 of 6). \nThe NCCN guideline for Ovarian Cancer Including Fallopian Tumor Cancer and Primary \nPeritoneal Cancer (1.2023) recommends that patients with recurrent disease, tumor molecular \nanalysis have at a minimum, tests to identify potential benefit from targeted therapeutics that \nhave tumor specific or tumor-agnostic benefit. (p OV-6) More comprehensive testing may be \nparticularly important in less common histologies with limited approved therapeutic options. (p. \nOV-B 1 of 3) These guidelines also recommend that molecular testing be performed on the most \nrecent tumor tissue available. (p. OV-8) \nThe NCCN guideline for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (2.2022) recommends tumor/somatic \nmolecular profiling for patients with local advanced/metastatic disease who are candidates for \nanti-cancer therapy to identify uncommon mutations. They also recommend considering \nspecifically testing for potentially actionable somatic findings including but not limited to \nfusions ( ALK, NRG1, NTRK, ROS1, FGFR2, RET ), mutations BRAF, BRCA1/2 , KRAS , PALB2 , \namplifications (HER2 ), MSI, and or mismatch repair deficiency. (p. PANC-1A) \nThe NCCN guideline for Prostate Cancer (1.2023) recommends for somatic tumor testing and \nthat tumor molecular and biomarker analysis may be used for treatment decision-making, \n\n \nConcert Genetics Oncology: Molecular Analysis of Solid Tumors and Hematologic \nMalignancies   \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023   \n \n \n   31 \n \nincluding understanding eligibility for biomarker-directed treatments, genetic counseling, early \nuse of platinum chemotherapy, and eligibility for clinical trials. The guidelines also recommend \nthat repeat tumor profiles can be considered at the time of progression of disease.

Multiplex gene panels and comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) \nanalysis are recommended for the ongoing management of AML and various phases of treatment \n(p. EVAL-1A). \nThe NCCN guidelines for myelodysplastic syndromes (1.2023) recommend that patients who \nhave persistent cytopenia (at least 4 to 6 months) and lack other underlying conditions that could \ncause cytopenia should be evaluated for myelodysplastic syndromes. (p. MS-3) NCCN describes \ncytopenia that is suspicious for myelodysplasia as the presence of peripheral blood dysplasia, \nblasts, or MDS-associated cytogenetic abnormalities. They say cytopenias are defined as values \nlower than standard lab hematologic levels, being cognizant of age, sex, ethnic, and altitude \nnorms (p. MDS-1, p. MDS-2). NCCN recommends ruling out other causes of anemia, such as \nnutritional deficiency of folate and vitamin B12, as well as measuring thyroid stimulating \nhormone levels, and HIV testing if clinically indicated (p. MDS-1). \nThe NCCN guidelines for myeloproliferative neoplasms (3.2022) recommend for patients \nsuspected of having an MPN to have molecular testing for J AK2 V617F , CALR  and MPL  \nmutations for patient with symptoms of essential thrombocythemia or myelofibrosis, and JAK2 \nexon 12 mutations for patients with polycythemia vera. This testing can be done in a stepwise \nmanner, or as an NGS multigene panel (p. MPN-1). \nThe NCCN guidelines for chronic myeloid leukemia (1.2023) indicate that a patient with \nadvanced phase CML in either accelerated or blast phase should consider mutational analysis \nwith a myeloid mutation panel (CML-1).

(p. \nMS-3)   \nTumor Specific NRAS  Variant Analysis \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), College of American Pathologists (CAP), and \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology (AMP) \nASCO, College of American Pathologists, Association for Molecular Pathology, and American \nSociety of Clinical Oncology (2017) published the following recommendations for the use of \nmolecular biomarkers for the evaluation of colorectal cancer: \n● Patients with CRC considered for anti-EGFR therapy must receive RAS mutational \ntesting. Mutational analysis should include KRAS  and NRAS  codons 12 and 13 of exon 2, \n59 and 61 of exon 3, and 117 and 146 of exon 4.  (p.193) \n● BRAF p.V600 ( BRAF c.1799 [p.V600]) mutational analysis should be performed in CRC \ntissue in patients with CRC for prognostic stratification. (p. 201) \n● BRAF p.V600 mutational analysis should be performed in dMMR tumors with loss o f \nMLH1 to evaluate for Lynch syndrome risk. Presence of a BRAF mutation strongly  \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetics Oncology: Molecular Analysis of Solid Tumors and Hematologic \nMalignancies   \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023   \n \n \n   45 \n \nfavors a sporadic pathogenesis. The absence of BRAF  mutation does not exclude risk of \nLynch syndrome. (p. 201)  \n●  \nClinicians should order MMR status testing in patients with CRCs for the identification \nof patients at high risk for Lynch syndrome and/or prognostic stratification. (p. 192)   \n       \n● There is insufficient evidence to recommend BRAF c.1799 p.V600 mutational status as a \npredictive molecular biomarker for response to anti- EGFR inhibitors. (p. 192) \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)  \nThe NCCN guideline on Colon Cancer (3.2022) recommends that all patients with metastatic \ncolorectal cancer should have tumor genotyped for RAS ( KRAS and NRAS ) and BRAF mutations \nindividually or as part of an NGS panel. (p. COL-B 4 of 8)  \n \n \n Tumor Specific PIK3CA  Variant Analysis  \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)  \nThe NCCN guidelines on breast cancer (2.2023) recommends that recurrent or stage IV HR-\npositive/HER2-negative breast cancers be assessed for PIK3CA  mutations with tumor or liquid \nbiopsy to identify candidates for Alpelisib + fulvestrant. They also recommend that recurrent or \nstage IV MSH-H/dMMR breast cancers that have progressed following prior treatment be \nconsidered for treatment with Pembrolizumab. (p. BINV-R 1 of 3) \nThe NCCN guidelines on uterine neoplasms (1.2022) recommend for Rhabdomyosarcoma, \nDICER1 mutations are present in up to 95% of embryonal RMS. PIK3CA and TP53 mutations in \npleomorphic tumors. And FOXO1 fusion in alveolar tumors. (p. UTSARC-A 7 of 8) \nTumor Specific RET  Variant Analysis  \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) \nThe NCCN guidelines on thyroid carcinoma (3.2022) recommend molecular diagnostic testing \nfor evaluating FNA results that are suspicious for follicular cell neoplasms or AUS/FLUS and \nsomatic RET testing in all individuals with newly diagnosed medullary thyroid carcinoma. \nAdditionally they comment that molecular testing has shown to be beneficial when making \ntargeted therapy decisions. (p. THYR-B) The guideline also comments that individuals with \nanaplastic thyroid cancer and/or metastatic disease should undergo molecular testing including \nBRAF, NTRK, ALK, RET and tumor mutational burden if not previously done. (p. ANAP- 3)        \n\n \nConcert Genetics Oncology: Molecular Analysis of Solid Tumors and Hematologic \nMalignancies   \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023   \n \n \n   46 \n \nThe NCCN guideline on non-small cell lung cancer (2.2023) recommends analysis for RET gene \nrearrangements, noting that NGS-based methodology has a high specificity  and that RNA-based \nNGS is preferable to DNA-based NGS for fusion detection. (p. NSCL-H, 5 of 7) \n \n Tumor Specific TP53 Variant Analysis  \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)  \nThe NCCN guidelines on acute myeloid leukemia (3.2022) state that a variety of gene mutations \nare associated with specific prognoses and may guide medical decision making while other \nmutations may have therapeutic implications. Presently this includes c- KIT, FLT-ITD, FLT-TKD, \nNPM1, CEBPA, IDH1/IDH2, RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53. Additionally, they recommend that \nASXL1,  BCR-ABL1  and PML- RAR alpha be tested in all patients and further recommend that \nmultiplex gene panels and NGS analysis be used for a comprehensive prognostic assessment. (p. \nMS-3)  \nThe NCCN guidelines on B-cell lymphoma (2.2023) recommend TP53 mutation analysis for \npatients with a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma in order to direct treatment selection, as \npatients with a TP53  mutation have been associated with poor prognosis when treated with \nconventional therapy. (p. MANT-1) \nThe NCCN guidelines for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (2.2023) \nrecommend TP53 sequencing analysis and IGHV  mutation analysis to inform prognosis and \ntherapeutic options for patients diagnosed with CLL/SLL or upon progression or recurrence (p. \nCSLL-1). Minimal residual disease testing at the end of treatment for CLL is recommended. (p. \nCSLL-2, 2 of 2) \nMeasurable (Minimal) Residual Disease (MRD) Analysis \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) \nThe NCCN guidelines for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1.2022) recommend baseline flow \ncytometric and/or molecular characterization of leukemic clone to facilitate subsequent \nminimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) analysis (p. ALL-1).  After treatment induction, \nMRD is recommended to determine consolidation therapy (p. ALL-3). For surveillance on bone \nmarrow aspirate, MRD assessment is recommended (p.

Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is a subset of CP  defined clinically as a\nfamilial pattern of CP . Variants of several genes are associated  with HP . Demonstration of a pathogenic variant in 1 or several of these genes can\npotentially be used to confirm the diagnosis of HP , provide information on prognosis and management, and/or  determine the risk of CP  in asymptomatic\nrelatives of patients with HP .\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether genetic testing improves the net health outcome for individuals with chronic or recurrent\npancreatitis or who have a familial risk for hereditary pancreatitis.\n \nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nGenetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis may be considered medically necessary  for individuals aged 18 years and younger with unexplained acute\nrecurrent (>1 episode) or chronic pancreatitis with documented elevated amylase or lipase levels.\nGenetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis is considered investigational  in all other situations.FEP 2.04.99 Genetic Testing for Hereditary Pancreatitis\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\n \nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It was implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society\"s\nnomenclature is recommended  by the Human V ariome Project, the Human  Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\" - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1. Nomenclature to Report on V ariants Found in DNA\nPrevious Updated Definition\nMutation Disease-associated variant Disease-associated change in the DNA  sequence\n Variant Change in the DNA  sequence\n Familial variant Disease-associated variant identified in a proband for use in subsequent\ntargeted genetic testing in first-degree relatives\nTable PG2. ACMG-AMP  Standards and Guidelines for V ariant Classification\nVariant Classification Definition\nPathogenic Disease-causing change in the DNA  sequence\nLikely pathogenic Likely disease-causing change in the DNA  sequence\nVariant of uncertain significance Change in DNA  sequence with uncertain ef fects on disease\nLikely benign Likely benign change in the DNA  sequence\nBenign Benign change in the DNA  sequence\nACMG: American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics; AMP: Association for Molecular Pathology .\nGenetic Counseling\nGenetic counseling is primarily aimed at individuals who are at risk for inherited disorders, and experts recommend formal genetic counseling in most\ncases when genetic testing for an inherited condition is considered. The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.99 Genetic Testing for Hereditary Pancreatitis\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\n \nFDA REGULA TORY STATUS\nTesting for variants associated with HP  is typically done by direct sequence analysis or next-generation sequencing. A number of laboratories of fer to\ntest for the relevant genes, either individually or as panels.\nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the\ngeneral regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Genetic testing for HP  is available under the auspices of the\nCLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who have chronic pancreatitis (CP) or acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) who receive testing for genes associated with hereditary\npancreatitis (HP) the evidence includes cohort studies on variant detection rates and meta-analyses. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in\ndisease status, morbid events, and hospitalizations. There are studies on the detection rate of HP-associated genes in various populations. Few\nstudies have enrolled patients with known HP; those doing so have reported detection rates for disease-associated variants between 52% and 62%.\nFor other studies that tested patients with CP  or ARP, disease-associated variant detection rates varied widely across studies. There is a lack of direct\nevidence that testing for HP  improves health outcomes and insuf ficient indirect evidence that, in patients with CP  or ARP, management would change\nafter genetic testing in a manner likely to improve health outcomes. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are asymptomatic with family members with HP  who receive testing for a known familial variant associated with HP , the evidence\nincludes a very limited number of studies. Relevant outcomes are symptoms, change in disease status, morbid events, and hospitalizations. No direct\nevidence was identified comparing outcomes in patients tested or not tested for a familial variant. It is possible that at-risk relatives who are identified\nas having a familial variant may alter lifestyle factors (eg, diet, smoking, alcohol use), and this might delay or prevent CP  onset. However , studies\nevaluating behavioral changes and the impact on disease are lacking. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Evaluation for Peutz-Jeghers\nSyndrome, L ynch Syndrome, and HP-associated genes should be considered if personal and/or family history criteria are met for the syndrome.34,\nThe 2020 ACG guidelines for CP  include the following recommendation for genetic testing in CP: \"W e recommend genetic testing in patients with\nclinical evidence of a pancreatitis-associated disorder or possible CP  in which the etiology is unclear , especially in younger patients (strong\nrecommendation, low quality of evidence).\"35, The goal of genetic testing is \"to identify underlying pancreatitis-related disorders that are contributing to\nthe pathogenic process, to assist in decision making, and to help prevent the development of irreversible CP .\" The guidelines include the following\ngenetic polymorphisms related to CP: PRSS , CPA1, CEL, SPINK1 , CTRC , CFTR , CASR , and CLDN2 ; however , the guidelines recommend (at a\nminimum) testing for PRSS1 , SPINK1 , CFTR , and CTRC  gene mutations in patients with idiopathic CP .\nAmerican Pancreatic Association\nIn 2014, the American Pancreatic Association published Practice Guidelines in Chronic Pancreatitis: Evidence-Based Report on Diagnostic\nGuidelines.36, A classification guideline for the etiology of CP  includes genetic mutations in PRSS1 , CFTR , SPINK1 , and others.\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 200137, (updated in 2004)38,; reaf firmed in 201339,), the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  issued a policy statement on\nlaboratory standards and guidelines for population-based cystic fibrosis carrier screening. These guidelines provided recommendations on specific\nvariant testing in cystic fibrosis but did not specifically address genetic testing for suspected HP . In 2020, a technical standard on CFTR  variant testing\nby the ACMG was released.40, The standard stated that indications for CFTR  variant testing included diagnosis and carrier testing for individuals with\nidiopathic pancreatitis.\nInternational Consensus Guidelines for Chronic Pancreatitis\nIn 2018, the working group for the International Consensus Guidelines for Chronic Pancreatitis, in collaboration with the International Association of\nPancreatology , American Pancreatic Association, Japan Pancreas Society , PancreasFest W orking Group, and the European Pancreatic Club,\npublished consensus statements on the diagnosis and management of early CP .41, It included the following recommendation:\n\"Genetic variants are important risk factors for Early CP  and can add specificity to the likely etiology , but they are neither necessary nor suf ficient to\nmake a diagnosis. (Quality assessment: moderate; Recommendation: strong; Agreement: strong)”\nThere was an update to the guideline in 2020, and it included the following statement: 42,\n\"In idiopathic disease, full sequence analysis of the CFTR , CPA1, CTRC , PRSS1  and SPINK1  gene exons and exon-intron boundaries and testing for\nthe CEL  gene pathogenic hybrid allele is recommended in order to explore the genetic background. (Quality assessment: low; Recommendation:\nconditional; Agreement: conditional).\"\nInternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis\nIn 2017, the International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis INSPPIRE  (The International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search  for a\ncuRE) consortium developed an expert consensus opinion on the evaluation  of children with acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis.43, There was a\nstrong  consensus that search for a genetic cause of acute recurrent pancreatitis or CP  should include PRSS1,  SPINK1, CFTR,  and CTRC  gene\nmutation testing.\n FEP 2.04.99 Genetic Testing for Hereditary Pancreatitis\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

ASCO further considered what surveillance strategies\nshould be used for individuals with a predisposition  to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma to screen for pancreatic and other cancers. Surveillance can\nbe considered for individuals who are first-degree relatives of individuals with familial pancreatic cancer and/or individuals with a family history of\npancreatic cancer who carry a pathogenic germline variant in genes associated with predisposition to pancreatic cancer .\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) released guidelines (v .2.2024 ) on genetic/familial high-risk assessment for breast, ovarian, and\npancreatic cancers.45, The NCCN recommends \"germline testing for PRSS1 , SPINK1 , and other pancreatitis genes in individuals with a personal\nand/or family history of exocrine pancreatic cancer only if there is a personal and/or family history suggestive of hereditary pancreatitis.\" In individuals\nwith pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in PRSS1  or other hereditary pancreatitis genes and a clinical phenotype consistent with hereditary\npancreatitis, NCCN recommends considering pancreatic cancer screening 20 years after onset of pancreatitis, or at age 40 years, whichever is earlier .\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results.

Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from \nfamilies with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations \nare more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for \nthese specific mutations.\"\nNote  This benefit/harm statement only applies to those jurisdictions that do not have \nMedicare guidance. Based upon the guidelines and evidence provided in the clinical \npolicy, following EviCore's criteria for BRCA analysis will ensure that testing will be \navailable to those members most likely to benefit from a genetic diagnosis. For those \nnot meeting criteria, it ensures alternate diagnostic strategies are considered. \nHowever, it is possible that some members who have the condition, but have non-\nstandard features, will not receive an immediate approval for testing.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

If the individual with\ncancer has pancreatic cancer or prostate cancer (metastatic or intraductal/cribriform or high-risk group or very-high-risk group) then only first-\ndegree relatives should be of fered testing unless there are other family history indications for testing.\nAn individual with any type of cancer (cancer related to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome but not meeting above criteria, or\ncancer unrelated to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome) or unaf fected individual who otherwise does not meet the criteria above\nbut has a probability >5% of a BRCA1/2  or PALB2  pathogenic variant based on prior probability models (eg, Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPro, Pennll).\nGenetic testing for BRCA 1 and BRCA2  variants of cancer-af fected individuals or cancer-unaf fected individuals with a family history of cancer when\ncriteria above are not met is considered investigational .\nTesting for PALB2  variants in individuals who do not meet the criteria outlined above is considered investigational .\nGenetic testing in minors for BRCA1,  BRCA2,  and PALB2  variants for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is considered investigational\n(see Policy Guidelines).\n \nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nPlans may need to alter local coverage medical policy to conform to state law regarding coverage of biomarker testing.\nThere are dif ferences in the position statements above and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline on Genetic/Familial High-\nRisk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic ( v .3.2024). Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for determining hereditary breast and\novarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy . Testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all\nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years, may be indicated for\nguiding cancer therapies. Genetic testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in breast cancer-, pancreatic cancer-, prostate cancer-, or ovarian cancer-\naffected individuals who are considering systemic therapy is addressed separately in evidence reviews 2.04.151, 2.04.148, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156,\nrespectively . Genetic testing for PALB2  variants in pancreatic cancer-af fected individuals is also addressed in 2.04.148. Additionally , conflicting criteria\nreflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited or no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of\ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.\nCurrent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation. W omen with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should\nreceive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant. In addition, there are potential harms related to stigmatization and discrimination. See policy 2.04.128 regarding testing of BRCA1 , BRCA2,\nand PALB2  for Fanconi anemia. See policies 2.04.148, 2.04.151, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156 regarding genetic testing to guide targeted therapy .\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nProstate Cancer\nIndividuals with BRCA  or PALB2  variants have an increased risk of prostate cancer , and individuals with known BRCA  or PALB2  variants may ,\ntherefore, consider more aggressive screening approaches for prostate cancer .\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine T umors\nCurrent NCCN guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( v .2.2024) refers to the NCCN guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk assessment of breast,\novarian, and pancreatic cancers detailed above, and state: \"The panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer\nand in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for inherited susceptibility .\" The panel recommends \"using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary\ncancer syndromes.\"89,\nThe NCCN guidelines for genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers ( v .3.2024) states that germline testing is\nclinically indicated for individuals with neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers per the NCCN guidelines on neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors.90, The\nNCCN guidelines for neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors ( v .1.2024) states, \"consider genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing: In a patient with\nduodenal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at any age\", noting, \"studies of unselected patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have identified\ngermline variants in 16%-17% of cases. However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result\non the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).

Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for determining hereditary breast and\novarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy . Testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all\nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years, may be indicated for\nguiding cancer therapies. Genetic testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in breast cancer-, pancreatic cancer-, prostate cancer-, or ovarian cancer-\naffected individuals who are considering systemic therapy is addressed separately in evidence reviews 2.04.151, 2.04.148, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156,\nrespectively . Genetic testing for PALB2  variants in pancreatic cancer-af fected individuals is also addressed in 2.04.148. Additionally , conflicting criteria\nreflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited or no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of\ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.\nCurrent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation. W omen with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should\nreceive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant. In addition, there are potential harms related to stigmatization and discrimination. See policy 2.04.128 regarding testing of BRCA1 , BRCA2,\nand PALB2  for Fanconi anemia. See policies 2.04.148, 2.04.151, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156 regarding genetic testing to guide targeted therapy .\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool.

If the individual  with  \ncancer  has pancreatic  cancer  or prostate  cancer  (metastatic  or intraductal/cribriform  or high -\nrisk group  or very -high -risk group)  then  only  first-degree  relatives  should  be offered  testing  \nunless  there  are other  family  history  indications  for testing.  \n• An individual  with  any type  of cancer  (cancer  related  to hereditary  breast  ovarian  cancer  \nsyndrome  but not meeting  above  criteria,  or cancer  unrelated  to hereditary  breast  ovarian  \ncancer  syndrome)  or unaffected  individual  who  otherwise  does  not meet  the criteria  above  but \nhas a probability  >5%  of a BRCA1 /2 or PALB2  pathogenic  variant  based  on prior  probability  \nmodels  (e.g., Tyrer -Cuzick,  BRCAPro,  Pennll).  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   3 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nGenetic  testing  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  of cancer -affected  individuals  or cancer -unaffected  \nindividuals  with  a family  history  of cancer  when  criteria  above  are not met is considered  investigational . \nTesting  for PALB2  variants  in individuals  who  do not meet  the criteria  outlined  above  is considered  \ninvestigational . \nGenetic  testing  in minors  for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  variants  for hereditary  breast  ovarian  cancer  \nsyndrome  is considered  investigational  (see Policy  Guidelines).  \nGenetic  Counseling  \nDocumentation  of individualized  genetic  counseling  is required  before  any genetic  testing  will be \nconsidered  medically  necessary.  See MP 2.04.570 . \nPOLICY  GUIDELINES  \nPlans  may  need  to alter  local  coverage  medical  policy  to conform  to state  law regarding  coverage  of \nbiomarker  testing.  \nThere  are differences  in the position  statements  above  and the National  Comprehensive  Cancer  \nNetwork  (NCCN)  guideline  on Genetic/Familial  High -Risk Assessment:  Breast,  Ovarian,  and Pancreatic  \n(v.3.202 4). Not all of the NCCN  criteria  are clearly  separated  for determining  hereditary  breast  and \novarian  cancer  syndrome  versus  for guiding  therapy.  Testing  for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and/or  PALB2  outside  of \nthe above  criteria,  such  as testing  all individuals  with  triple  negative  breast  cancer  or testing  all \nindividuals  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  under  the age of 50 years,  may  be indicated  for guiding  cancer  \ntherapies.  Genetic  testing  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  in breast  cancer -, pancreatic  cancer -, prostate  \ncancer -, or ovarian  cancer -affected  individuals  who  are considering  systemic  therapy  is addressed  \nseparately  in evidence  reviews  2.04.151,  2.04.148,  2.04.155,  and 2.04.156,  respectively.  Genetic  testing  \nfor PALB2  variants  in pancreatic  cancer -affected  individuals  is also addressed  in 2.04.148.  Additionally,  \nconflicting  criteria  reflect  that some  of the NCCN  criteria  are based  on limited  or no evidence;  the lower  \nlevel  of evidence  might  be needed  when  determining  coverage  of testing  mandated  by state  biomarker  \nlegislation.  \nCurrent  U.S. Preventive  Services  Task  Force  guidelines  recommend  screening  women  with  a personal  or \nfamily  history  of breast,  ovarian,  tubal,  or peritoneal  cancer  or who  have  an ancestry  associated  with  \nBRCA1 /2 gene  mutation.  Women  with  a positive  result  on the risk assessment  tool should  receive  \ngenetic  counseling  and,  if indicated  after  counseling,  genetic  testing  (B recommendation).  \nRecommended  screening  tools  designed  to identify  a family  history  that may  be associated  with  an \nincreased  risk for potentially  harmful  variants  in BRCA1  or BRCA2  are: \n• Ontario  Family  History  Assessment  Tool  (FHAT)  \n• Manchester  Scoring  System  \n• Referral  Screening  Tool  (RST)  \n• Pedigree  Assessment  Tool  (PAT)  \n• Family  History  Screen  (FHS -7) \n• International  Breast  Cancer  Intervention  Study  instrument  (Tyrer -Cuziak)  \n• Brief  versions  of the BRCAPRO  \nClose  Relatives  \nClose  relatives  are blood  related  family  members  including  1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-degree  relatives  on the \nsame  side of the family  (maternal  or paternal).  \n• 1st-degree  relatives  are parents,  siblings,  and children.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   4 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \n• 2nd-degree  relatives  are grandparents,  aunts,  uncles,  nieces,  nephews,  grandchildren,  and half-\nsiblings.  \n• 3rd-degree  relatives  are great -grandparents,  great -aunts,  great -uncles,  great -grandchildren,  and \nfirst cousins.  \nProstate  Cancer  Risk Groups  \nRisk groups  for prostate  cancer  in this policy  include  high -risk groups  and very -high -risk groups.  \nHigh -risk group:  no very -high -risk features  and are T3a (American  Joint  Committee  on Cancer  staging  \nT3a = tumor  has extended  outside  of the prostate  but has not spread  to the seminal  vesicles);  OR Grade  \nGroup  4 or 5; OR prostate  specific  antigen  of 20 ng/mL  or greater.  \nVery -high -risk group:  T3b-T4 (tumor  invades  seminal  vesicle(s);  or tumor  is fixed  or invades  adjacent  \nstructures  other  than  seminal  vesicles  such  as external  sphincter,  rectum,  bladder,  levator  muscles,  \nand/or  pelvic  wall);  OR Primary  Gleason  Pattern  5; OR 2 or 3 high -risk features;  OR greater  than  4 cores  \nwith  Grade  Group  4 or 5. \nRecommended  Testing  Strategies  \nIndividuals  who  meet  criteria  for genetic  testing  as outlined  in the policy  statements  above  should  be \ntested  for variants  in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2 . Recommended  strategies  are listed  below.  \n• In individuals  with  a known  familial  BRCA  or PALB2  variant,  targeted  testing  for the specific  \nvariant  is recommended.  \n• In individuals  with  unknown  familial  BRCA  or PALB2  variant:  \no  \n▪ To identify  clinically  significant  variants,  NCCN  advises  testing  a relative  who  has \nearly -onset  disease,  bilateral  disease,  or multiple  primaries,  because  that \nindividual  has the highest  likelihood  of obtaining  a positive  test result.  Unless  \nthe affected  individual  is a member  of an ethnic  group  for which  particular  \nfounder  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  are known,  comprehensive  \ngenetic  testing  (i.e., full sequencing  of the genes  and detection  of large  gene  \nrearrangements)  should  be performed.  \n▪ If no living  family  member  with  breast  or ovarian  cancer  exists,  NCCN  suggests  \ntesting  first- or second -degree  family  members  affected  with  cancer  thought  to \nbe related  to deleterious  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants  (e.g., prostate  cancer,  \npancreatic  cancer,  melanoma).  \n▪ If no familial  variant  can be identified,  2 possible  testing  strategies  are: \n• Full sequencing  of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed  by testing  for large  genomic  rearrangements  \n(deletions,  duplications)  only  if sequencing  detects  no variant  (negative  result).  \no More  than  90%  of BRCA  variants  will be detected  by full sequencing.  \n• Alternatively,  simultaneous  full sequencing  and testing  for large  genomic  rearrangements  (also  \nknown  as comprehensive  BRCA  testing;  see Comprehensive  Variant  Analysis  below)  may  be \nperformed  as is recommended  by NCCN.  \no Comprehensive  testing  can detect  92.5%  of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.  \n• Testing  for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through  panel  testing  over  serial  testing  might  be \npreferred  for efficiency.  Multi -gene  panels  often  include  genes  of moderate  or low penetrance,  \nand genes  with  limited  evidence  on which  to base  management  decisions.  When  considering  a \ngene  panel,  NCCN  recommends  use of \"tailored  panels  that are disease -focused  and include  \nclinically  actionable  cancer  susceptibility  genes\".  \n• Ashkenazi  Jewish  descent  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   5 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \no In individuals  of known  Ashkenazi  Jewish  descent,  one approach  is to test for the 3 \nknown  founder  mutations  (185delAG  and 5182insC  in BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first;  \nif testing  is negative  for founder  mutations  and if the individual's  ancestry  also included  \nnon-Ashkenazi  ethnicity  (or if other  BRCA1 /2 testing  criteria  are met),  comprehensive  \ngenetic  testing  should  be considered.  \nTesting  strategy  may  also include  testing  individuals  not meeting  the above  criteria  who  are adopted  \nand have  limited  medical  information  on biological  family  members,  individuals  with  small  family  \nstructure,  and individuals  with  presumed  paternal  transmission.  \nComprehensive  Variant  Analysis  \nComprehensive  variant  analysis  currently  includes  sequencing  the coding  regions  and intron  and exon  \nsplice  sites,  as well as testing  to detect  large  deletions  and rearrangements  that can be missed  with  \nsequence  analysis  alone.  In addition,  before  August  2006,  testing  for large  deletions  and rearrangements  \nwas not performed,  thus  some  individuals  with  familial  breast  cancer  who  had negative  BRCA  testing  \nbefore  this time  may  consider  repeat  testing  for the rearrangements  (see Policy  section  for criteria).  \nHigh -Risk Ethnic  Groups  \nTesting  of eligible  individuals  who  belong  to ethnic  populations  in which  there  are well-characterized  \nfounder  mutations  should  begin  with  tests  specifically  for these  variants.  For example,  founder  \nmutations  account  for approximately  three -quarters  of the BRCA  variants  found  in Ashkenazi  Jewish  \npopulations  (see Rationale  section).  When  testing  for founder  mutations  is negative,  a comprehensive  \nvariant  analysis  should  then  be performed.  \nTesting  Unaffected  Individuals  \nIn unaffected  family  members  of potential  BRCA  or PALB2  variant  families,  most  test results  will be \nnegative  and uninformative.  Therefore,  it is strongly  recommended  that an affected  family  member  be \ntested  first whenever  possible  to adequately  interpret  the test.  Should  a BRCA  or PALB2  variant  be \nfound  in an affected  family  member(s),  DNA  from  an unaffected  family  member  can be tested  \nspecifically  for the same  variant  of the affected  family  member  without  having  to sequence  the entire  \ngene.  Interpreting  test results  for an unaffected  family  member  without  knowing  the genetic  status  of \nthe family  may  be possible  in the case  of a positive  result  for an established  disease -associated  variant  \nbut leads  to difficulties  in interpreting  negative  test results  (uninformative  negative)  or variants  of \nuncertain  significance  because  the possibility  of a causative  BRCA  or PALB2  variant  is not ruled  out. \nTesting  for known  variants  of BRCA  or PALB2  genes  in an unaffected  reproductive  partner  may  be \nindicated  as carrier  screening  for rare autosomal  recessive  conditions.  \nConfirmatory  Testing  \nConsideration  might  be given  at the local  level  for confirmatory  germline  testing  of a BRCA  or PALB2  \npathogenic/likely  pathogenic  variant  found  on tumor  genomic  analyses,  direct -to-consumer  testing,  or \nresearch  testing.  \nTesting  Minors  \nThe use of genetic  testing  for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or PALB2  variants  for identifying  hereditary  breast  ovarian  \ncancer  syndrome  has limited  or no clinical  utility  in minors,  because  there  is no change  in management  \nfor minors  as a result  of knowledge  of the presence  or absence  of a deleterious  variant.  In addition,  \nthere  are potential  harms  related  to stigmatization  and discrimination.  See policy  2.04.128  regarding  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   6 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \ntesting  of BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  for Fanconi  anemia.  See policies  2.04.148,  2.04.151,  2.04.155,  and \n2.04.156  regarding  genetic  testing  to guide  targeted  therapy.  \nProstate  Cancer  \nIndividuals  with  BRCA  or PALB2  variants  have  an increased  risk of prostate  cancer,  and individuals  with  \nknown  BRCA  or PALB2  variants  may,  therefore,  consider  more  aggressive  screening  approaches  for \nprostate  cancer.  \nGenetics  Nomenclature  Update  \nThe Human  Genome  Variation  Society  nomenclature  is used  to report  information  on variants  found  in \nDNA  and serves  as an international  standard  in DNA  diagnostics.  It is being  implemented  for genetic  \ntesting  medical  evidence  review  updates  starting  in 2017  (see Table  PG1).  The Society's  nomenclature  is \nrecommended  by the Human  Variome  Project,  the Human  Genome  Organization,  and by the Human  \nGenome  Variation  Society  itself.  \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  and the Association  for Molecular  Pathology  \nstandards  and guidelines  for interpretation  of sequence  variants  represent  expert  opinion  from  both  \norganizations,  in addition  to the College  of American  Pathologists.  These  recommendations  primarily  \napply  to genetic  tests  used  in clinical  laboratories,  including  genotyping,  single  genes,  panels,  exomes,  \nand genomes.  Table  PG2 shows  the recommended  standard  terminology - \"pathogenic,\"  \"likely  \npathogenic,\"  \"uncertain  significance,\"  \"likely  benign,\"  and \"benign\" - to describe  variants  identified  that \ncause  Mendelian  disorders.  \nTable  PG1.

The interpretation  of the results  of genetic  tests  and the understanding  of risk factors  can \nbe very  difficult  and complex.  Therefore,  genetic  counseling  will assist  individuals  in understanding  the \npossible  benefits  and harms  of genetic  testing,  including  the possible  impact  of the information  on the \nindividual’s  family.  Genetic  counseling  may  alter  the utilization  of genetic  testing  substantially  and may  \nreduce  inappropriate  testing.  Genetic  counseling  should  be performed  by an individual  with  experience  \nand expertise  in genetic  medicine  and genetic  testing  methods.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   7 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nCoding  \nSee the Codes  table  for details.  \nBENEFIT  APPLICATION  \nBlueCard/National  Account  Issues  \nSome  Plans  may  have  contract  or benefit  exclusions  for genetic  testing.  \nUnder  the Patient  Protection  and Affordable  Care  Act, preventive  services  with  a U.S. Preventive  \nServices  Task  Force  recommendation  grade  of A or B will be covered  with  no cost-sharing  requirements.  \nPlans  that have  been  grandfathered  are exceptions  to this rule and are not subject  to this coverage  \nmandate.   \nBenefit  Exceptions  \nThis policy  may  not apply  to all lines  of business  such  as the Federal  Employee  Program,  Medicare  \nSupplement,  Medicare  Advantage,  Medicaid,  and certain  self-insured  groups.  \nBACKGROUND  \nHereditary  Breast  and Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  \nSeveral  genetic  syndromes  with  an autosomal  dominant  pattern  of inheritance  that features  breast  \ncancer  have  been  identified.  Of these,  hereditary  breast  and ovarian  cancer  (HBOC)  syndrome  and some  \ncases  of hereditary  site-specific  breast  cancer  have  in common  causative  variants  in BRCA  (breast  cancer  \nsusceptibility)  genes.  Families  suspected  of having  HBOC  syndrome  are characterized  by an increased  \nsusceptibility  to breast  cancer  occurring  at a young  age, bilateral  breast  cancer,  male  breast  cancer,  \novarian  cancer  at any age, as well as cancer  of the fallopian  tube  and primary  peritoneal  cancer.  Other  \ncancers,  such  as prostate  cancer,  pancreatic  cancer,  gastrointestinal  cancers,  melanoma,  and laryngeal  \ncancer,  occur  more  frequently  in HBOC  families.  Hereditary  site-specific  breast  cancer  families  are \ncharacterized  by early -onset  breast  cancer  with  or without  male  cases,  but without  ovarian  cancer.  For \nthis evidence  review,  BCBSA  refers  collectively  to both  as hereditary  breast  and/or  ovarian  cancer.  \nGermline  variants  in the BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes  are responsible  for the cancer  susceptibility  in most  \nHBOC  families,  especially  if ovarian  cancer  or male  breast  cancer  are features.  However,  in site-specific  \ncancer,  BRCA  variants  are responsible  only  for a proportion  of affected  families.  BRCA  gene  variants  are \ninherited  in an autosomal  dominant  fashion  through  maternal  or paternal  lineage.  It is possible  to test \nfor abnormalities  in BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes  to identify  the specific  variant  in cancer  cases  and to \nidentify  family  members  at increased  cancer  risk. Family  members  without  existing  cancer  who  are \nfound  to have  BRCA  variants  can consider  preventive  interventions  for reducing  risk and mortality.  \nEvidence  suggests  that genetic  services  are not equitably  applied.  Chapman -Davis  et al (2021)  found  that \nnon-Hispanic  Whites  and Asians  were  more  likely  to be referred  for genetic  services  based  solely  on \nfamily  history  than  were  non-Hispanic  Blacks  and Hispanics.1, In addition,  non-Hispanic  Black  patients  \nand Hispanic  patients  were  more  likely  to have  advanced  cancer  when  referred  for genetic  services  than  \nnon-Hispanic  Whites  and Asians.  \nClinical  Features  Suggestive  of BRCA  Variant  \nYoung  age of onset  of breast  cancer,  even  in the absence  of family  history,  is a risk factor  for BRCA1  \nvariants.  Winchester  (1996)  estimated  that hereditary  breast  cancers  account  for 36%  to 85%  of patients  \ndiagnosed  before  age 30 years.2, In several  studies,  BRCA  variants  were  independently  predicted  by early  \nage at onset,  being  present  in 6% to 10%  of breast  cancer  cases  diagnosed  at ages  younger  than  various  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   8 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \npremenopausal  age cutoffs  (age  range,  35 to 50 years).2,3,4,5, In cancer -prone  families,  the mean  age of \nbreast  cancer  diagnosis  among  women  carrying  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants  is in the 40s.6, In the Ashkenazi  \nJewish  population,  Frank  et al (2002)  reported  that 13%  of 248 cases  with  no known  family  history  and \ndiagnosed  before  50 years  of age had BRCA  variants.3, In a similar  study  by Gershoni -Baruch  et al (2000),  \n31%  of Ashkenazi  Jewish  women,  unselected  for family  history,  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  at younger  \nthan  42 years  of age had BRCA  variants.7, Other  studies  have  indicated  that early  age of breast  cancer  \ndiagnosis  is a significant  predictor  of BRCA  variants  in the absence  of family  history  in this \npopulation.8,9,10, \nAs in the general  population,  a family  history  of breast  or ovarian  cancer,  particularly  of early  age onset,  \nis a significant  risk factor  for a BRCA  variant  in ethnic  populations  characterized  by founder  mutations.  \nFor example,  in unaffected  individuals  of Ashkenazi  Jewish  descent,  12%  to 31%  will have  a BRCA  variant  \ndepending  on the extent  and nature  of the family  history.5, Several  other  studies  have  documented  the \nsignificant  influence  of family  history.7,8,9,10,11, \nIn patients  with  “triple -negative”  breast  cancer  (i.e., negative  for expression  of estrogen,  progesterone,  \nand overexpression  of human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2 receptors),  there  is an increased  \nprevalence  of BRCA  variants.  Pathophysiologic  research  has suggested  that the physiologic  pathway  for \nthe development  of triple -negative  breast  cancer  is similar  to that for BRCA -associated  breast  cancer.12, \nIn 200 randomly  selected  patients  with  triple -negative  breast  cancer  from  a tertiary  care  center,  Kandel  \net al (2006)  reported  that there  was a greater  than  3-fold increase  in the expected  rate of BRCA  \nvariants.13,BRCA1  variants  were  found  in 39.1%  of patients  and BRCA2  variants  in 8.7%.  Young  et al \n(2009)  studied  54 women  with  high -grade,  triple -negative  breast  cancer  with  no family  history  of breast  \nor ovarian  cancer,  representing  a group  that previously  was not recommended  for BRCA  testing.14, Six \nBRCA  variants  (5 BRCA1 , 1 BRCA2 ) were  found,  for a variant  rate of 11%.  Finally,  Gonzalez -Angulo  et al \n(2011)  in a study  of 77 patients  with  triple -negative  breast  cancer,  reported  that 15 patients  (19.5%)  had \nBRCA  variants  (12 in BRCA1 , 3 in BRCA2 ).15, \nPALB2  Gene  \nThe PALB2  gene  (partner  and localizer  of BRCA2 ) encodes  for a protein  first described  in 2006.16, The \ngene  is located  at 16p12.2  [Short  (p) arm of chromosome  16 at position  12.2.]  and has 13 exons.  PALB2  \nprotein  assists  BRCA2  in DNA  repair  and tumor  suppression.  Heterozygous  pathogenic  PALB2  variants  \nincrease  the risk of developing  breast  and pancreatic  cancers;  homozygous  variants  are found  in Fanconi  \nanemia.  Fanconi  anemia  is a rare disorder,  primarily  affecting  children,  that causes  bone  marrow  failure.  \nAffected  individuals  also carry  a risk of cancers  including  leukemia.  Most  pathogenic  PALB2  variants  are \ntruncating  frameshift  or stop  codons,  and are found  throughout  the gene.  Pathogenic  PALB2  variants  \nare uncommon  in unselected  populations  and prevalence  varies  by ethnicity  and family  history.  For \nexample,  Antoniou  et al (2014)  assumed  a prevalence  of 8 per 10,000  in the general  population  when  \nmodeling  breast  cancer  risks.17, Variants  are more  prevalent  in ethnic  populations  where  founder  \nmutations  have  persisted  (e.g., Finns,  French  Canadians,  Poles),  while  infrequently  found  in others  (e.g., \nAshkenazi  Jews).18,19, In women  with  a family  history  of breast  cancer,  the prevalence  of pathogenic  \nPALB2  variants  ranges  between  0.9%  and 3.9%,17, or substantially  higher  than  in an unselected  general  \npopulation.  Depending  on population  prevalence,  PALB2  may  be responsible  for as much  as 2.4%  of \nhereditary  breast  cancers17, , and in populations  with  founder  mutations  cause  0.5%  to 1% of all breast  \ncancers.20, \nRegulatory  Status  \nClinical  laboratories  may  develop  and validate  tests  in-house  and market  them  as a laboratory  service;  \nlaboratory -developed  tests  must  meet  the general  regulatory  standards  of the Clinical  Laboratory  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   9 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nImprovement  Amendments.  Genetic  tests  reviewed  in this evidence  review  are available  under  the \nauspices  of the Clinical  Laboratory  Improvement  Amendments.  Laboratories  that offer  laboratory -\ndeveloped  tests  must  be licensed  by the Clinical  Laboratory  Improvement  Amendments  for high -\ncomplexity  testing.  To date,  the U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  has chosen  not to require  any \nregulatory  review  of this test.  \nRATIONALE  \nThis evidence  review  was created  in July 1997  and has been  updated  regularly  with  searches  of the \nPubMed  database.  The most  recent  literature  update  was performed  through  June 12, 2024.  \nThis review  was informed  by a TEC Assessment  (1997).21, \nEvidence  reviews  assess  whether  a medical  test is clinically  useful.  A useful  test provides  information  to \nmake  a clinical  management  decision  that improves  the net health  outcome.  That  is, the balance  of \nbenefits  and harms  is better  when  the test is used  to manage  the condition  than  when  another  test or \nno test is used  to manage  the condition.  \nThe first step  in assessing  a medical  test is to formulate  the clinical  context  and purpose  of the test.  The \ntest must  be technically  reliable,  clinically  valid,  and clinically  useful  for that purpose.  Evidence  reviews  \nassess  the evidence  on whether  a test is clinically  valid  and clinically  useful.  Technical  reliability  is \noutside  the scope  of these  reviews,  and credible  information  on technical  reliability  is available  from  \nother  sources.  \nPromotion  of greater  diversity  and inclusion  in clinical  research  of historically  marginalized  groups  (e.g.,  \nPeople  of Color  [African -American,  Asian,  Black,  Latino  and Native  American];  LGBTQIA  (Lesbian,  Gay,  \nBisexual,  Transgender,  Queer,  Intersex,  Asexual);  Women;  and People  with  Disabilities  [Physical  and \nInvisible])  allows  policy  populations  to be more  reflective  of and findings  more  applicable  to our diverse  \nmembers.  While  we also strive  to use inclusive  language  related  to these  groups  in our policies,  use of \ngender -specific  nouns  (e.g.,  women,  men,  sisters,  etc.)  will continue  when  reflective  of language  used  in \npublications  describing  study  populations.  \nTesting  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  Variants  in Individuals  at Risk for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  \nSyndrome  or Other  High -Risk Cancers  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of testing  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  in individuals  at high -risk for hereditary  breast  and \novarian  cancer  (HBOC)  syndrome  is to evaluate  whether  variants  are present  and if so, to determine  the \nappropriate  surveillance  and treatment  to decrease  the risk of mortality  from  breast  and/or  ovarian  \ncancer.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is individuals  with  cancer  (i.e., breast  cancer,  epithelial  ovarian,  \nfallopian  tube,  primary  peritoneal  cancer),  or individuals  with  a personal  or family  history  of cancer  and \ncriteria  that might  suggest  they  are at risk for HBOC  syndrome.  \nInterventions  \nThe intervention  of interest  is BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant  testing.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   10 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nFor patients  without  a cancer  diagnosis  who  are assessing  cancer  risk, results  may  guide  potential  \nprophylactic  measures  such  as surveillance,  chemoprevention,  or prophylactic  mastectomy,  and/or  \noophorectomy.  \nFor patients  with  a cancer  diagnosis,  results  may  guide  treatment  decisions.  \nTesting  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  is conducted  in adults  when  appropriate  treatment  and/or  \nprophylactic  treatment  options  are available.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to manage  HBOC  syndrome  or other  high -risk cancers:  \nstandard  of care  without  genetic  testing.  \nOutcomes  \nThe outcomes  of interest  are overall  survival  (OS),  disease -specific  (breast  and ovarian  cancer)  survival,  \ntest validity,  and quality  of life (QOL;  e.g., anxiety).  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity,  studies  of variant  prevalence  and cancer  risk were  included.  For \nthe evaluation  of clinical  utility,  studies  that represent  the intended  clinical  use of the technology  in the \nintended  population  were  included.  The quality  and credibility  of the evidence  depend  on study  design  \nand conduct,  minimizing  bias and confounding  that can generate  incorrect  findings.  \nEvidence  for the 2 indications  is presented  together  because  there  is overlap  in the evidence  base  for \nthe 2 populations:  (1) patients  at risk for HBOC  syndrome,  and (2) patients  with  other  high -risk cancers  \nsuch  as cancers  of the fallopian  tube,  pancreas,  and prostate.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nPrevalence  of BRCA  Variants  and Risks  of Cancer  and Survival  \nThe prevalence  of BRCA  variants  is approximately  0.1%  to 0.2%  in the general  population.  The \nprevalence  may  be much  higher  for particular  ethnic  groups  with  characterized  founder  mutations  (e.g., \n2.5%  [1/40]  in the Ashkenazi  Jewish  population).  A family  history  of breast  and ovarian  cancer  is an \nimportant  risk factor  for the BRCA  variant;  additionally,  age and ethnicity  could  be independent  risk \nfactors.  \nSystematic  Reviews  \nA systematic  review  published  by Zhu et al (2016)  found  a significantly  lower  risk of OS in breast  cancer  \npatients  with  BRCA1  (pooled  hazard  ratio  [HR],  1.69;  95%  confidence  interval  [CI], 1.35  to 2.12)  and with  \nBRCA2  (pooled  HR, 1.50;  95%  CI, 1.02  to 2.09;  p=.034).22, However,  in patients  with  breast  cancer,  BRCA1  \nand BRCA2  were  not associated  with  a lower  breast  cancer -specific  survival.  \nNelson  et al (2013)  conducted  a systematic  review  that included  meta -analytic  estimates  of the \nprevalence  and penetrance  of BRCA  variants;  this review  was used  to update  the U.S. Preventive  \nServices  Task  Force  (USPSTF)  recommendation  for risk assessment,  genetic  counseling,  and genetic  \ntesting  for BRCA -related  cancer.23, In high -risk women  with  positive  test results,  cumulative  risks  for \ndeveloping  breast  cancer  by age 70 years  were  46%  for BRCA1  and 50%  for BRCA2  when  a single  family  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   11 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nmember  was tested,  and 70%  for BRCA1  and 71%  for BRCA2  when  multiple  family  members  were  \ntested;  cumulative  risks  for developing  ovarian  cancer  by age 70 years  were  41%  for BRCA1  and 17%  for \nBRCA2  when  a single  family  member  was tested;  and 46%  for BRCA1  and 23%  for BRCA2  when  multiple  \nfamily  members  were  tested.  For Ashkenazi  Jewish  women  with  positive  test results,  cumulative  risks  \nfor developing  breast  or ovarian  cancer  by age 75 years  were  34%  and 21%,  respectively.  Nelson  et al \n(2013)  included  meta -analytic  estimates  of BRCA  prevalence  in their  review  for USPSTF.  In unselected  \nwomen,  BRCA  variant  prevalence  estimates  were  0.2%  to 0.3%;  in women  with  breast  cancer,  1.8%  for \nBRCA1  and 1.3%  for BRCA2 ; in women  with  breast  cancer  onset  at age 40 years  or younger,  6%; in \nwomen  from  high -risk families,  13.6%  for BRCA1 , 7.9%  for BRCA2 , and 19.8%  for BRCA1  or BRCA2 ; in \nunselected  Ashkenazi  Jewish  women,  2.1%;  and in Ashkenazi  Jewish  women  from  high -risk families,  \n10.2%.  \nEstimates  of lifetime  risk of cancer  for BRCA  variant  carriers  (penetrance),  based  on studies  of families  \nwith  an extensive  history  of the disease,  have  been  as high  as 85%.  For example,  Kuchenbaecker  et al \n(2017)  found  that the cumulative  risk of breast  cancer  up to age 80 years  was 72%  in BRCA1  carriers  and \n69%  in BRCA2  carriers.24, Because  other  factors  that influence  risk may  be present  in families  with  \nextensive  breast  and ovarian  cancer  histories,  early  penetrance  estimates  may  have  been  biased  \nupward.25, Studies  of founder  mutations  in ethnic  populations  (e.g., Ashkenazi  Jewish,  Polish,  Icelandic  \npopulations)  unselected  for family  history  have  indicated  lower  penetrance  estimates,  in the range  of \n40%  to 60%  for BRCA1  and 25%  to 40%  for BRCA2 .8,11,26,27, However,  a genotyping  study  of Ashkenazi  \nJewish  women  with  incident  invasive  breast  cancer,  selected  regardless  of family  history  of cancer  and \ntheir  family  members,  resulted  in an 82%  lifetime  risk of breast  cancer  for carriers  of any of 3 BRCA  \nfounder  mutations  (185delAG,  5382insC,  6174delT).27, Importantly,  the risk of cancer  in variant  carriers  \nfrom  families  with  little  history  of cancer  (>50%  of all carriers)  did not differ  significantly.  Lifetime  risk \nestimates  of ovarian  cancer  were  54%  for BRCA1  and 23%  for BRCA2  variant  carriers.  \nProspective  Studies  \nWomen  with  a history  of breast  cancer  and a BRCA  variant  have  a significant  risk of contralateral  breast  \ncancer.  In a prospective  study  by Metcalfe  et al (2004),  the 10-year  risk was 29.5%  for women  with  initial  \nstage  I or II diseases.28, In a prospective  study,  Epidemiological  Study  of Familial  Breast  Cancer,  \nMavaddat  et al (2013)  reported  that the cumulative  risk of contralateral  breast  cancer  by age 70 years  \nwas 83%  in the BRCA1  variant  carriers,  and 62%  for BRCA2  variant  carriers.29, These  investigators  also \nreported  cumulative  risks  of breast  cancer  by age 70 years  in women  without  previous  cancer  (60%  in \nBRCA1  carriers,  55%  in BRCA2  carriers).  Similarly,  the cumulative  risk estimates  of ovarian  cancer  by age \n70 years  in women  without  previous  ovarian  cancer  were  59%  for BRCA1  carriers  and 17%  for BRCA2  \ncarriers.  \nBRCA  Variant  Rates  Associated  With  Ovarian  Cancer  \nWomen  with  a personal  history  of ovarian  cancer  have  an increased  rate of BRCA  variants.  In a \nsystematic  review  of 23 studies,  Trainer  et al (2010)  estimated  the rate of BRCA  variants  among  women  \nwith  ovarian  cancer  3% to 15%.30, In this review,  3 U.S. studies  tested  for both  BRCA1  and BRCA2 ; \nincidences  of BRCA  variants  were  11.3%,  15.3%,  and 9.5%.  In the systematic  review  for USPSTF  by \nNelson  et al (2013),  meta -analytic  estimates  of BRCA  prevalence  among  women  with  ovarian  cancer  \nwere  4.4%  for BRCA1  and 5.6%  for BRCA2 .23, Table  1 lists the results  from  several  additional  studies  \nmeasuring  the presence  of BRCA  variants  among  patients  with  ovarian  cancer.31,32,33,34,35, One study  \nnoted  that variant  prevalence  was higher  for women  in their  40s (24%)  and for women  with  serous  \novarian  cancer  (18%).31, Ethnicity  was another  risk factor  for BRCA , with  higher  rates  seen  in women  of \nItalian  (43.5%),  Jewish  (30%),  and Indo -Pakistani  (29.4%)  origin.31, \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   12 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nTable  1.

Reviewers  noted  that these  findings  supported  other  studies  that have  \ndemonstrated  the fimbrial  end of the fallopian  tube  as an important  site of cancer  in those  with  BRCA1  \nor BRCA2  variants.  \nA long -term  study  by Powell  et al (2013;  median  follow -up, 7 years;  range,  3 to 14 years)  followed  32 \nBRCA  variant  carriers  with  occult  malignancy  (4 ovarian,  23 fallopian  tube,  5 ovarian  and fallopian  tube)  \ndiagnosed  of prophylactic  salpingo -oophorectomy.37, Among  15 women  with  invasive  carcinoma  \n(median  age, 50 years),  7 (47%)  experienced  recurrence  at a median  of 33 months,  and OS was 73%.  \nAmong  17 women  with  noninvasive  neoplasia  (median  age,  53 years),  4 (24%)  received  chemotherapy,  \nnone  of whom  experienced  recurrence.  One (6%)  patient  who  did not receive  chemotherapy  \nexperienced  recurrence  at 43 months.  OS was 100%.  The authors  concluded  that,  in BRCA  variant  \ncarriers,  unsuspected  invasive  carcinoma  has a relatively  high  rate of recurrence,  but noninvasive  \nneoplasms  rarely  recur  and may  not require  adjuvant  chemotherapy.  \nBRCA  Variant  Rates  Associated  With  Pancreatic  Cancer  \nUnaffected  individuals  also may  be at high -risk due to other  patterns  of non-breast -cancer  malignancies.  \nA personal  history  of pancreatic  cancer  is estimated  to raise  the risk of a BRCA  variant  by 3.5- to 10-fold \nover  the general  population.38, Table  2 lists the results  from  several  studies  measuring  the presence  of \nBRCA  variants  among  patients  with  pancreatic  adenocarcinoma.39,40,41,42,43,44, Patients  with  pancreatic  \nadenocarcinoma  of Jewish  descent  appear  to have  a higher  prevalence  of BRCA  variants  compared  with  \nthe general  population  of patients  with  pancreatic  adenocarcinoma.  \nTable  2.

For example,  Walsh  et al (2006)  reported  on probands  \nfrom  300 U.S. families  with  4 or more  cases  of breast  or ovarian  cancer  but with  negative  (wild -type)  \ncommercial  genetic  tests  for BRCA1  and BRCA2 .48, These  patients  underwent  screening  with  additional  \nmultiple  DNA -based  and RNA -based  methods.  Of these  300 patients,  17%  carried  previously  undetected  \nvariants,  including  35 (12%)  with  genomic  rearrangement  of BRCA1  or BRCA2 . \nA study  by Palma  et al (2008)  evaluated  251 patients  with  an estimated  BRCA  variant  prevalence  using  \nthe Myriad  II model  of at least  10%.49, In 136 non-Ashkenazi  Jewish  probands,  36 (26%)  had BRCA  point  \nmutations  and 8 (6%)  had genomic  rearrangements  (7 in BRCA1 , 1 in BRCA2 ). Genomic  rearrangements  \ncomprised  18%  of all identified  BRCA  variants.  No genomic  rearrangements  were  identified  in the 115 \nAshkenazi  Jewish  probands,  but 47 (40%)  had point  mutations.  The authors  indicated  that the estimated  \nprevalence  of a variant  did not predict  the presence  of a genomic  rearrangement.  \nClinically  Useful  \nA test is clinically  useful  if the use of the results  informs  management  decisions  that improve  the net \nhealth  outcome  of care.  The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  or \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs).  In their  systematic  review  for the USPSTF,  Nelson  et \nal (2019)  confirmed  that they  identified  no studies  that compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  BRCA  variant  testing.50, \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   14 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nKnowledge  of variant  status  in individuals  at potentially  increased  risk of a BRCA  variant  may  impact  \nhealth  care  decisions  to reduce  risk.51,52,53,54,55,56,57, Risk-reducing  options  include  intensive  surveillance,  \nchemoprevention,  prophylactic  mastectomy,  or prophylactic  oophorectomy.  \nProphylactic  mastectomy  reduces  the risk of breast  cancer  in high -risk women  (based  on family  history)  \nby 90%.52, Prophylactic  oophorectomy  significantly  reduces  the risk of ovarian  cancer  by 80%  or \nmore55,56,58, and reduces  the risk of breast  cancer  by approximately  50%.56, In women  who  have  already  \nhad breast  cancer,  prophylactic  oophorectomy  reduces  the risk of cancer  relapse.42, Prophylactic  \noophorectomy  or salpingo -oophorectomy  in women  with  BRCA1  or BRCA2  reduced  the risk of all-cause  \nmortality  by 60%  to 77%.58,59, For patients  at risk for both  breast  and ovarian  cancer,  a study  by Elmi  et al \n(2018),  drawing  on data  from  the American  College  of Surgeon’s  National  Surgical  Quality  Improvement  \nProgram  dataset,  found  that prophylactic  mastectomy  with  concurrent  salpingo -oophorectomy  was not \nassociated  with  significant  additional  morbidity  compared  with  prophylactic  mastectomy  alone.60, \nSystematic  reviews  of observational  studies  comparing  prophylactic  surgeries  with  observation  in \nwomen  who  had BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  have  demonstrated  that contralateral  prophylactic  \nmastectomy  in women  with  breast  cancer  is associated  with  significantly  lower  all-cause  mortality  while  \nbilateral  prophylactic  mastectomy  was not associated  with  all-cause  mortality.61,62,63, Studies  have  \nindicated  that the results  of genotyping  significantly  influenced  treatment  choices.53,64,57, \nIn a systematic  review  for the USPSTF,  Nelson  et al (2019)  assessed  the efficacy  of risk-reducing  surgery  \nin BRCA -positive  women.50, The literature  search  was conducted  through  March  2019.  A total  of 13 \nobservational  studies  (n=9938)  provided  consistent  and moderate -strength  evidence  of the benefits  of \nrisk-reducing  surgery.  For high -risk women  and variant  carriers,  bilateral  mastectomy  reduced  breast  \ncancer  incidence  by 90%  to 100%  and breast  cancer  mortality  by 81%  to 100%;  oophorectomy  or \nsalpingo -oophorectomy  reduced  breast  cancer  incidence  by 37%  to 83%,  ovarian  cancer  incidence  by \n69%  to 100%.  Some  women  experienced  reduced  anxiety.  Limitations  of the studies  of benefits  included  \nlack of comparison  groups,  variations  in methodology  and enrollment  criteria,  and heterogeneous  \noutcome  measures.  Additionally,  a total  of 14 observational  studies  (n=3073)  provided  low-strength  \nevidence  of the harms  of risk-reducing  surgery.  Adverse  events  included  physical  complications  of the \nsurgery,  postsurgical  symptoms,  and changes  in body  image.  Studies  of harms  shared  the same  \nlimitations  as the studies  of benefits  as noted  above,  with  the addition  that their  findings  were  \ninconsistent  and the sample  sizes  were  smaller.  As reviewers  observed,  it is still currently  unknown  \nwhether  BRCA  variant  testing  reduces  cause -specific  or all-cause  mortality,  or if it improves  the QOL.  \nHarms  associated  with  false -negative  results  or variants  of uncertain  significance  also are unknown.  \nOther  studies  have  looked  at the results  of prostate  cancer  screening  in men  with  BRCA  variants.  The \nImmunotherapy  for Prostate  Adenocarcinoma  Treatment  study  (2011)  evaluated  the results  of \nscreening  in 205 men  40 to 69 years  of age who  were  BRCA  variant  carriers  and 95 control  patients.65, At \nthe baseline  screen,  biopsies  were  performed  in 7.0%  of men  with  a prostate -specific  antigen  level  \ngreater  than  3.0 ng/mL,  and prostate  cancer  was identified  in 3.3%.  This resulted  in a positive  predictive  \nvalue  of 47.6%,  which  is considerably  higher  than  that estimated  for men  at normal  risk. Moreover,  the \ngrade  of tumor  identified  was intermediate  in 67%  of cancers  and high  in 11%.  This differs  from  the \nexpected  distribution  of cancer  grade  in average -risk men,  with  more  than  60%  expected  to have  low-\ngrade  cancer.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   15 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nSection  Summary:  Testing  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  Variants  in Individuals  at Risk for Hereditary  Breast  \nand Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  or Other  High -Risk Cancers  \nEvidence  for the clinical  validity  of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant  testing  consists  of multiple  studies  that \ncalculated  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant  prevalence  among  samples  of patients  with  HBOC  syndrome,  \nfallopian  tube  cancer,  pancreatic  cancer,  and prostate  cancer.  \nRegarding  clinical  utility  of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant  testing,  current  evidence  has not directly  evaluated  \nmanagement  with  and without  genetic  testing.  In terms  of prophylactic  measures  (mastectomy  and \noophorectomy),  RCTs  would  be difficult  to conduct.  However,  retrospective  analyses  have  shown  that \nprophylactic  mastectomy  and/or  oophorectomy  greatly  reduced  the risk of breast  cancer  (90%  to 100%)  \nand ovarian  cancer  (69%  to 100%).  \nPALB2  and Breast  Cancer  Risk Assessment  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of testing  for PALB2  variants  in women  at high -risk of HBOC  syndrome  is to evaluate  \nwhether  an abnormal  variant  is present  and,  if so, to determine  whether  the variant  conveys  a \nsufficiently  high -risk such  that changes  in surveillance  and/or  treatment  that are likely  to decrease  the \nrisk of mortality  from  breast  cancer  are warranted.  \nPotential  benefit  derives  from  interventions  (screening,  chemoprevention,  risk-reducing  surgery)  that \ncan prevent  first breast  cancer,  contralateral  breast  cancer,  or cancer  in a different  organ  caused  by the \nsame  variant.  Whether  benefit  outweighs  harms  depends  on the risk of developing  breast  cancer  (first  \ncancer  or a contralateral  one)  and the effectiveness  and the harms  of interventions.  \nAssessing  the net health  outcome  requires:  \n• That  a test accurately  identifies  variants  and pathogenicity  can be determined;  \n• That  a variant  alters  (increasing  or decreasing)  a woman's  risk of developing  breast  cancer  \n(including  contralateral  disease  in women  already  diagnosed)  sufficient  to change  decision  \nmaking,  and of a magnitude  that \n• Management  changes  informed  by testing  can lead  to improved  health  outcomes.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nGenetic  testing  can be considered  for women  at increased  risk of developing  hereditary  breast  cancer  \nbased  on their  family  history  or in women  with  breast  cancer  whose  family  history  or cancer  \ncharacteristics  (e.g., triple -negative  disease,  young  age)  increase  the likelihood  that the breast  cancer  is \nhereditary.  Testing  may  also be considered  for women  from  families  with  known  variants.  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  for this review  are individuals  who  are undergoing  assessment  for \nHBOC  syndrome.  \nInterventions  \nThe intervention  of interest  is PALB2  variant  testing.  \nComparators  \nThe alternative  would  be to manage  women  at high -risk of HBOC  syndrome  with  no PALB2  genetic  \ntesting.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   16 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nOutcomes  \nThe outcomes  of interest  are OS, disease -specific  (breast  and ovarian  cancer)  survival,  and test validity.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of the clinical  validity  of the tests,  studies  that meet  the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Included  a suitable  reference  standard  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described  with  women  at high  breast  cancer  risk \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nSystematic  Reviews  \nSuszynska  et al (2019)  reported  a systematic  review  of variants  identified  in panels  of breast  and ovarian  \ncancer -related  genes.66, Results  were  reported  for PALB2 , CHEK2,  and ATM.  CHEK2  and ATM  results  will \nbe discussed  in the following  sections.  The systematic  review  included  studies  published  through  July \n2017  reporting  on genetic  test results  of breast  and ovarian  cancer  patients  who  were  referred  for \nevaluation  by a multi -gene  panel.  Given  that the Suszynska  et al (2019)  report  included  only  studies  \nreporting  on test results  from  a panel,  it does  not substantially  overlap  with  the studies  described  in the \nfollowing  section  including  other  PALB2  association  studies.  The studies  of panel  results  were  used  to \ncalculate  mutation  frequencies  by the gene.  As a control,  population  mutation  frequencies  were  \nextracted  from  the Genome  Aggregation  Database.  Forty -three  studies  included  panels  in breast  cancer  \npatients.  In the breast  cancer  studies,  95,853  patients  were  included  in the analysis  of PALB2 . PALB2  \nvariants  were  identified  in 0.9%  of breast  cancer  patients.  The meta -analytic  estimate  odds  ratio  (OR)  of \nthe association  between  PALB2  variants  and risk of breast  cancer  was 4.8 (95%   confidence interval [CI] , \n4.1 to 5.6).  \nObservational  Studies  \nA number  of studies  (Tables  4 and 5) reporting  relative  risks  (RRs)  or ORs for the association  between  \nPALB2  and breast  cancer  were  identified.18,17,19,20,67,68,69,70,71,72,73, Study  designs  included  family  \nsegregation67,74,, kin-cohort,17, family -based  case -control,19,69,75, and population -based  or multicenter  \ncase -control.18,20,68,70,71,72,73, The 2 multinational  studies  included  individuals  from  up to 5 of the single -\ncountry  studies.17,71, The number  of pathogenic  variants  identified  varied  from  1 (founder  mutations  \nexamined)  to 48 (Table  4). Studies  conducted  from  single -country  samples  are described  first followed  \nby the 2 multinational  collaborative  efforts.  \nSingle -Country  Samples  \nWoodward  et al (2021)  assessed  the contribution  of PALB2  gene  variants  to familial  breast  and ovarian  \ncancer.73, A total  of 3127  women  with  a histologically  confirmed  diagnosis  of invasive  or in situ breast  \ncancer  or an epithelial  nonmucinous  ovarian  cancer  who  had undergone  germline  testing  of BRCA1 , \nBRCA2 , PALB2 , and CHEK2 _c.1100delC  were  included.

Index  cases  were  identified  from  Familial  Cancer  Centers  and a Pathology  \ncenter  in Australia,  and controls  were  identified  from  the LifePool  mammography  screening  study.  \nLu et al (2019)  included  an analysis  of 11,416  patients  with  breast  cancer  and/or  ovarian  cancer  who  \nwere  referred  for genetic  testing  from  1200  U.S. hospitals  and clinics  and of 3988  controls  referred  for \ngenetic  testing  for noncancer  conditions  between  2014  and 2015.72, Whole -exome  sequencing  was used  \nand suspected  pathogenic  variants  in the breast  or ovarian  cancer -associated  genes  were  confirmed  by \nSanger  sequencing.  \nKurian  et al (2017)  reported  the association  between  pathogenic  variants  and breast  or ovarian  cancer  \nusing  a commercial  laboratory  database  of 95,561  women  tested  clinically  for hereditary  cancer  risk \nusing  a multi -gene  panel  that included  PALB2 , CHEK2 , and ATM .32, Although  the country  is not stated,  \nthe patients  underwent  testing  between  2013  and 2015  performed  at a Clinical  Laboratory  \nImprovement  Amendments  (CLIA)  laboratory  and,  thus,  will be assumed  to include  patients  from  the \nU.S. Cases  were  women  with  a single  diagnosis  of breast  or ovarian  cancer.  Controls  were  women  from  \nthe same  database  (i.e., being  tested  for hereditary  cancer)  with  no cancer  history  at the time  of genetic  \ntesting.  The multivariable  models  for breast  cancer  risk are reported  here.  Among  the breast  cancer  \npatients,  244 (0.92%)  had a PALB2  variant.  The association  between  PALB2  and breast  cancer  adjusting  \nfor age, ancestry,  personal  and family  cancer  histories,  and Lynch  and adenomatous  polyposis  colon  \ncancer  syndromes  had an OR of 3.39  (95%  CI, 2.79  to 4.12).  \nThompson  et al (2015)  evaluated  Australian  women  with  breast  cancer  (n=1996)  referred  for genetic  \nevaluation  from  1997  to 2014.70, A control  group  was accrued  from  participants  in the LifePool  study  \n(n=1998)  who  were  recruited  for a mammography  screening  program.  All PALB2  coding  exons  were  \nsequenced  by next -generation  sequencing  and novel  variants  verified  by Sanger  sequencing.  Large  \ndeletions  or rearrangements  were  not evaluated.  Nineteen  distinct  pathogenic  variants  were  identified,  \nincluding  6 not previously  described  in 26 (1.3%)  cases  and in 4 (0.2%)  controls  with  an odds  for breast  \ncancer  of 6.58  (95%  CI, 2.3 to 18.9).  Moreover,  54 missense  variants  identified  were  slightly  more  \ncommon  in cases  (OR,  1.15;  95%  CI, 1.02  to 1.32).  \nCybulski  et al (2015)  examined  2 loss-of-function  PALB2  variants  (c.509_510delGA,  c.172_175delTTGT)  in \nwomen  with  invasive  breast  cancer  diagnosed  between  1996  and 2012  in Poland.20, From  12,529  \ngenotyped  women,  a PALB2  variant  was identified  in 116 (0.93%)  cases  (95%  CI, 0.76%  to 1.09%)  versus  \n10 (0.21%  ; 95%  CI, 0.08%  to 0.34%)  of 4702  controls  (OR,  4.39;  95%  CI, 2.30  to 8.37).  A BRCA1  variant  \nwas identified  in 3.47%  of women  with  breast  cancer  and in 0.47%  of controls  (OR,  7.65;  95%  CI, 4.98  to \n11.75).  Authors  estimated  that a PALB2  sequence  variant  conferred  a 24%  cumulative  risk of breast  \ncancer  by age 75 years  (in the setting  of age-adjusted  breast  cancer  rates  slightly  more  than  half that in \nthe U.K.76, or the U.S.77,). A PALB2  variant  was also associated  with  poorer  prognosis:  10-year  survival  of \n48.0%  versus  74.7%  when  the variant  was absent  (HR adjusted  for prognostic  factors,  2.27;  95%  CI, 1.64  \nto 3.15).  \nCatucci  et al (2014)  performed  population -based  case -control  studies  in Italy  (Milan  or Bergamo)  among  \nwomen  at risk for hereditary  breast  cancer  and no BRCA1  or BRCA2  variant.18, In Milan,  9 different  \npathogenic  PALB2  variants  were  detected  in 12 of 575 cases  and none  in 784 controls  (blood  donor);  in \nBergamo,  PALB2  c.1027C>T  variants  were  detected  in 6 of 113 cases  and in 2 of 477 controls  (OR,  13.4;  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   18 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \n95%  CI, 2.7 to 67.4).  Performed  in 2 distinct  populations,  the combined  sample  size was small,  and \nuncertainty  existed  as indicated  by the large  effect  estimate.  \nCasadei  et al (2011)  studied  959 U.S. women  (non -Ashkenazi  Jewish  descent)  with  a family  history  of \nBRCA1 - or BRCA2 -negative  breast  cancer  and 83 female  relatives  using  a family -based  case -control  \ndesign.19, Using  conventional  sequencing,  pathogenic  PALB2  variants  were  detected  in 31 (3.2%)  women  \nwith  breast  cancer  and none  in controls.  Compared  with  their  female  relatives  without  PALB2  variants,  \nthe risk of breast  cancer  increased  2.3-fold (95%  CI, 1.5 to 4.2) by age 55 years  and 3.4-fold (95%  CI, 2.4 \nto 5.9) by age 85 years.  Mean  age at diagnosis  was not associated  with  the presence  of a variant  (50.0  \nyears  with  vs. 50.2  years  without).  Casadei  et al (2011)  provided  few details  of their  analyses.  \nAdditionally,  participants  reported  over  30 ancestries  and,  given  intermarriage  in the U.S. population,  \nstratification  may  have  had an impact  on results.  Generalizability  of the risk estimate  is therefore  \nunclear.  \nHeikkinen  et al (2009)  conducted  a population -based  case -control  study  at a Finnish  university  hospital  \nemploying  2 case  groups  (947  familial  and 1274  sporadic  breast  cancers)  and 1079  controls.68, The study  \nsample  was obtained  from  542 patients  with  familial  breast  cancer,  a series  of 884 oncology  patients  \n(79%  of consecutive  new  cases),  and 986 surgical  patients  (87%  of consecutive  new  cases);  1706  were  \ngenotyped  for the PALB2  c.1592delT  variant.  All familial  cases  were  BRCA1 - and BRCA2 -negative,  but \namong  controls,  there  were  183 BRCA  carriers.  PALB2  variant  prevalence  varied  with  family  history:  \n2.6%  when  3 or more  family  members  were  affected  and 0.7%  in all breast  cancer  patients.  Variant  \nprevalence  was 0.2%  among  controls.  In women  with  hereditary  disease,  a PALB2  c.1592delT  variant  \nwas associated  with  an increased  risk of breast  cancer  (OR,  11.0;  95%  CI, 2.65  to 97.78),  and was higher  \nin women  with  the strongest  family  histories  (women  with  sporadic  cancers;  OR, 4.19;  95%  CI, 1.52  to \n12.09).  Although  data  were  limited,  survival  was lower  among  PALB2 -associated  cases  (10-year  survival,  \n66.5%;  95%  CI, 44.0%  to 89.0%  vs. 84.2%;  95%  CI, 83.1%  to 87.1%  in women  without  a variant;  p=.041;  \nHR, 2.94;  p=.047).  A PALB2  variant  was also associated  with  triple -negative  tumors:  54.5%  versus  12.2%  \nwith  familial  disease  and 9.4%  in sporadic  cancers.  \nMultinational  Samples  \nYang  et al (2020)  performed  a complex  segregation  analysis  to estimate  relative  and absolute  risks  of \nbreast  cancer  from  data  on 524 families  with  PALB2  pathogenic  variants  from  21 countries,  the most  \nfrequent  being  c.3113G>A.74, Female  breast  cancer  (RR was 7.18  (95%  CI, 5.82  to 8.85;  p=6.5x10-75) when  \nassumed  to be constant  with  age.  The age-trend  model  provided  the best  fit (p=2x10-3) and \ndemonstrated  a pattern  of decreasing  RR with  each  increased  decade  in age.  The RR was 4.69  (95%  CI, \n3.28  to 6.70)  in those  75 years  of age per the age-trend  model.  \nSouthey  et al (2016)  examined  the association  of 3 PALB2  variants  (2 protein -truncating:  c.1592delT  and \nc.3113G>A;  1 missense  c.2816T>G)  with  breast,  prostate,  and ovarian  cancers.71, The association  with  \nbreast  cancer  was examined  among  participants  in the Breast  Cancer  Association  Consortium  (BCAC;  \n42,671  cases  and 42,164  controls).  The BCAC  (part  of the larger  Collaborative  Oncological  Gene -\nenvironment  Study)  included  48 separate  studies  with  participants  of multiple  ethnicities,  but mainly  \nEuropean,  Asian,  and African  American.  Most  studies  were  population - or hospital -based  case -controls  \nwith  some  oversampling  cases  with  family  histories  or bilateral  disease.  A custom  array  was used  for \ngenotyping  at 4 centers,  with  2% duplicate  samples.  The ORs were  estimated  adjusting  for study  among  \nall participants,  and excluding  those  studies  selecting  patients  based  on family  history  or bilateral  \ndisease  (37,039  cases,  38,260  controls).  The c.1592delT  variant  was identified  in 35 cases  and 6 controls  \n(from  4 studies  in the U.K.,  Australia,  U.S.,  Canada;  OR, 4.52;  95%  CI, 1.90  to 10.8;  p<.001);  in those  with  \nno family  history  or bilateral  disease  (OR,  3.44;  95%  CI, 1.39  to 8.52;  p=.003).  The c3113G>A  variant  was \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   19 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nidentified  in 44 cases  and 8 controls  (9 studies  from  Finland  and Sweden;  OR, 5.93;  95%  CI, 2.77  to 12.7;  \np<.001)  and in those  with  no family  history  or bilateral  disease  (OR,  4.21;  95%  CI, 1.84  to 9.60;  p<.001).  \nThere  was no association  between  the c2816T>G  missense  variant  and breast  cancer  (found  in 150 cases  \nand 145 controls).  These  results,  derived  from  a large  sample,  used  a different  analytic  approach  than  \nAntoniou  et al (2014),  described  next,  and examined  only  2 pathogenic  variants.  The magnitude  of the \nestimated  RR approaches  that of a high  penetrance  gene  but is accompanied  by wide  CIs owing  to the \nstudy  design  and low carrier  prevalence.  The lower  estimates  obtained  following  exclusion  of those  \nselected  based  on family  history  or bilateral  disease  are consistent  with  the importance  of carefully  \nconsidering  the risk of hereditary  disease  prior  to genetic  testing.  \nAntoniou  et al (2014)  analyzed  data  from  362 members  of 154 families  with  deleterious  PALB2  \nvariants.17, Individuals  with  benign  variants  or variants  of uncertain  significance  were  excluded.  Families  \nwere  recruited  at 14 centers  in 8 countries  (U.S.,  U.K.,  Finland,  Greece,  Australia,  Canada,  Belgium,  Italy)  \nand had at least  1 member  with  a BRCA1 - or BRCA2 -negative  PALB2 -positive  breast  cancer.  There  were  \n311 women  with  PALB2  variants:  229 had breast  cancer;  51 men  also had PALB2  variants  (7 had breast  \ncancer).  Of the 48 pathogenic  (loss -of-function)  variants  identified,  2 were  most  common  (c.1592delT  in \n44 families,  c.3113G>A  in 25 families);  39 of the 48 pathogenic  variants  were  found  in just 1 or 2 \nfamilies.  Carriers  of PALB2  variants  (men  and women)  had a 9.47 -fold increased  risk for breast  cancer  \n(95%  CI, 7.16  to 12.57)  compared  with  the U.K. population  under  a single -gene  model  and age-constant  \nRR; 30%  of tumors  were  triple -negative.  For a woman  aged  50 to 54 years,  the estimated  RR was 6.55  \n(95%  CI, 4.60  to 9.18).  The RR of breast  cancer  for males  with  PALB2  variants,  compared  with  the male  \nbreast  cancer  incidence  in the general  population,  was 8.3 (95%  CI, 0.77  to 88.5;  p=.08).  The cumulative  \nrisk at age 50 years  of breast  cancer  for female  PALB2  carriers  without  considering  family  history  was \n14%  (95%  CI, 9% to 20%);  by age 70 years,  it was 35%  (95%  CI, 26%  to 46%).  A family  history  of breast  \ncancer  increased  the cumulative  risk. If a woman  with  a PALB2  variant  has a sister  and mother  who  had \nbreast  cancer  at age 50 years,  by age 50 years  she would  have  a 27%  (95%  CI, 21%  to 33%)  estimated  \nrisk of developing  breast  cancer;  and by age 70 years,  a 58%  (95%  CI, 50%  to 66%)  risk. These  results  \nemphasize  that family  history  affects  penetrance.  Authors  noted  that the study  \"includes  most  of the \nreported  families  with  PALB2  variant  carriers,  as well as many  not previously  reported\".  \nTable  4.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nEvidence  of clinical  utility  limited  to women  with  PALB2  variants  was not identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nRosenthal  et al (2017)  reported  an analysis  of the impact  of testing  for genes  other  than  BRCA1 /2 and by \ncalculating  whether  carriers  of these  gene  variants  would  have  been  identified  as candidates  for \nenhanced  screening  based  on family  history  alone.78, The database  included  194,107  women  who  were  \ntested  using  a hereditary  cancer  panel  between  2013  and 2016.  The women  were  referred  by their  \nhealth  care  providers  for clinical  suspicion  of hereditary  cancer.  It is unclear  what  proportion  of the \nwomen  met professional  society  criteria  for genetic  testing  for breast  cancer  risk; baseline  information  \nregarding  family  history  was not reported.  Of the women  in the database,  893 had PALB2  variants  and \nwere  eligible  for Claus  assessment  to estimate  the risk of breast  cancer.  Approximately  27%  of women  \nwith  PALB2  variants  would  have  had an estimated  risk of breast  cancer  of 20%  or higher  based  on the \nClaus  model.  The report  did not include  health  outcomes  and it is unclear  whether  enhanced  screening  \nin women  who  had a moderate  penetrance  variant  but did not have  an estimated  risk of breast  cancer  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   25 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nof 20%  or greater  based  on the Claus  model  would  have  improved  health  outcomes  from  enhanced  \nsurveillance.  \nStudies  of women  at high -risk based  on family  history  alone  or in those  with  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  \nare relevant  to the clinical  utility  of PALB2  testing  given  the penetrance  estimates  for PALB2  and related  \nmolecular  mechanism  (\"BRCA -ness\").  Interventions  to decrease  breast  cancer  risk in asymptomatic  high -\nrisk women  include  screening79, (e.g., starting  at an early  age, the addition  of magnetic  resonance  \nimaging  to mammography,  and screening  annually),  chemoprevention,80, and prophylactic  \nmastectomy.81, In women  with  breast  cancer,  contralateral  prophylactic  mastectomy  is of interest;  other  \ntreatment  decisions  are dictated  by clinical,  pathologic,  and other  prognostic  factors.  \nIn women  at high -risk of hereditary  breast  cancer,  including  BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers,  evidence  \nsupports  a reduction  in subsequent  breast  cancer  after  bilateral  or contralateral  prophylactic  \nmastectomy.  Decision  analyses  have  also concluded  the impact  on breast  cancer  incidence  extends  life \nin high,  but not average  risk,82, women.  For example,  Schrag  et al (1997,  2000)  modeled  the impact  of \npreventive  interventions  in women  with  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants  and examined  penetrance  \nmagnitudes  similar  to those  estimated  for a PALB2  variant.83,84, Compared  with  surveillance,  a 30-year -\nold BRCA  carrier  with  an expected  40%  risk of breast  cancer  and 5% risk of ovarian  cancer  by age 70 \nyears  would  gain  an expected  2.9 years  following  a prophylactic  mastectomy  alone  and an additional  0.3 \nyears  with  a prophylactic  oophorectomy  (Table  8).83, A 50-year -old female  BRCA  carrier  with  node -\nnegative  breast  cancer  and a 24%  risk of contralateral  breast  cancer  at age 70 years  would  anticipate  0.9 \nyears  in improved  life expectancy  (0.6 years  for node -negative  disease)  following  a prophylactic  \ncontralateral  mastectomy.84, \nTable  8.

While  \nestimates  of the magnitude  of the association  between  PALB2  and breast  cancer  risk varied  across  \nstudies,  their  magnitudes  are of moderate  to high  penetrance.  \nOf interest  is how  variant  detection  affects  penetrance  estimates  compared  with  family  history  alone.  As \nwith  BRCA  variants,  model -based  estimates  allow  estimating  risks  for individual  patient  and family  \ncharacteristics.  To illustrate  using  the Breast  and Ovarian  Analysis  of Disease  Incidence  and Carrier  \nEstimation  Algorithm  model,  a woman  age 30 years  whose  mother  had breast  cancer  at age 35 years  has \nan estimated  14.4%  risk of breast  cancer  at age 70 years.  If she carries  a PALB2  variant,  the risk increases  \nto 51.1%.  A woman,  age 50 years,  with  breast  cancer  whose  mother  had breast  cancer  at age 50 years,  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   26 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nhas an estimated  11.7%  risk of contralateral  cancer  by age 70 years,  increasing  to 28.7%  if she carries  a \nPALB2  variant.  \nEvidence  concerning  preventive  interventions  in women  with  PALB2  variants  is indirect,  relying  on \nstudies  of high -risk women  and BRCA  carriers.  In women  at high -risk of hereditary  breast  cancer  who  \nwould  consider  preventive  interventions,  identifying  a PALB2  variant  provides  a more  accurate  \nestimated  risk of developing  breast  cancer  compared  with  family  history  alone  and can offer  a better  \nunderstanding  of benefits  and potential  harms  of interventions.  \nSummary  of Evidence  \nFor individuals  who  have  cancer  or a personal  or family  cancer  history  and meet  criteria  suggesting  a risk \nof hereditary  breast  and ovarian  cancer  (HBOC)  syndrome  who  receive  genetic  testing  for a BRCA1  or \nBRCA2  variant,  the evidence  includes  a TEC Assessment  and studies  of variant  prevalence  and cancer  \nrisk. Relevant  outcomes  are overall  survival  (OS),  disease -specific  survival,  test validity,  and quality  of life \n(QOL).  The accuracy  of variant  testing  has been  shown  to be high.  Studies  of lifetime  risk of cancer  for \ncarriers  of a BRCA  variant  have  shown  a risk as high  as 85%.  Knowledge  of BRCA  variant  status  in \nindividuals  at risk of a BRCA  variant  may  impact  health  care  decisions  to reduce  risk, including  intensive  \nsurveillance,  chemoprevention,  and/or  prophylactic  intervention.  In individuals  with  BRCA1  or BRCA2  \nvariants,  prophylactic  mastectomy  and oophorectomy  have  been  found  to significantly  increase  disease -\nspecific  survival  and OS. Knowledge  of BRCA  variant  status  in individuals  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  \nmay  impact  treatment  decisions.  The evidence  is sufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in \nan improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  have  other  high -risk cancers  (e.g., cancers  of the fallopian  tube,  pancreas,  prostate)  \nwho  receive  genetic  testing  for a BRCA1  or BRCA2  variant,  the evidence  includes  studies  of variant  \nprevalence  and cancer  risk. Relevant  outcomes  are OS, disease -specific  survival,  test validity,  and QOL.  \nThe accuracy  of variant  testing  has been  shown  to be high.  Knowledge  of BRCA  variant  status  in \nindividuals  with  other  high -risk cancers  can inform  decisions  regarding  genetic  counseling,  \nchemotherapy,  and enrollment  in clinical  trials.  The evidence  is sufficient  to determine  that the \ntechnology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  with  a risk of HBOC  syndrome  who  receive  genetic  testing  for a PALB2  variant,  the \nevidence  includes  studies  of clinical  validity  and studies  of breast  cancer  risk, including  a meta -analysis.  \nRelevant  outcomes  are OS, disease -specific  survival,  and test validity.  Evidence  supporting  clinical  \nvalidity  was obtained  from  numerous  studies  reporting  RRs or ORs.  Study  designs  included  family  \nsegregation,  kin-cohort,  family -based  case -control,  and population -based  case -control.  The number  of \npathogenic  variants  identified  in studies  varied  from  1 (founder  mutations)  to 48. The relative  risk for \nbreast  cancer  associated  with  a PALB2  variant  ranged  from  2.3 to 13.4,  with  the 2 family -based  studies  \nreporting  the lowest  values.  Evidence  of preventive  interventions  in women  with  PALB2  variants  is \nindirect,  relying  on studies  of high -risk women  and BRCA  carriers.  These  interventions  include  screening  \nwith  magnetic  resonance  imaging,  chemoprevention,  and risk-reducing  mastectomy.  Given  the \npenetrance  of PALB2  variants,  the outcomes  following  bilateral  and contralateral  risk-reducing  \nmastectomy  examined  in women  with  a family  history  consistent  with  hereditary  breast  cancer  \n(including  BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers)  can be applied  to women  with  PALB2  variants,  with  the benefit -to-\nrisk balance  affected  by penetrance.  In women  at high -risk of hereditary  breast  cancer  who  would  \nconsider  risk-reducing  interventions,  identifying  a PALB2  variant  provides  a more  precise  estimated  risk \nof developing  breast  cancer  compared  with  family  history  alone  and can offer  women  a more  accurate  \nunderstanding  of benefits  and potential  harms  of any intervention.  The evidence  is sufficient  to \ndetermine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   27 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nSUPPLEMENTAL  INFORMATION  \nThe purpose  of the following  information  is to provide  reference  material.  Inclusion  does  not imply  \nendorsement  or alignment  with  the evidence  review  conclusions.  \nClinical  Input  From  Physician  Specialty  Societies  and Academic  Medical  Centers  \nWhile  the various  physician  specialty  societies  and academic  medical  centers  may  collaborate  with  and \nmake  recommendations  during  this process,  through  the provision  of appropriate  reviewers,  input  \nreceived  does  not represent  an endorsement  or position  statement  by the physician  specialty  societies  \nor academic  medical  centers,  unless  otherwise  noted.  \n2010  Input  \nIn response  to requests,  input  was received  for 3 physician  specialty  societies  (5 reviewers)  and 3 \nacademic  medical  centers  (5 reviewers)  while  this policy  was under  review  in 2010.  Those  providing  \ninput  were  in general  agreement  with  the Policy  statements  considering  testing  for genomic  \nrearrangements  of BRCA1  and BRCA2  as medically  necessary  and with  adding  fallopian  tube  and primary  \nperitoneal  cancer  as BRCA -associated  malignancies  to assess  when  obtaining  the family  history.  \nPractice  Guidelines  and Position  Statements  \nGuidelines  or position  statements  will be considered  for inclusion  in ‘Supplemental  Information'  if they  \nwere  issued  by, or jointly  by, a US professional  society,  an international  society  with  US representation,  \nor National  Institute  for Health  and Care  Excellence  (NICE).  Priority  will be given  to guidelines  that are \ninformed  by a systematic  review,  include  strength  of evidence  ratings,  and include  a description  of \nmanagement  of conflict  of interest.  \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology  \nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in \npatients with breast cancer.85, The guideline recommends  BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with \nbreast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65 years (including \nthose who are eligible for poly -ADP ribose polymerase [PARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history \nof breast cancer may also be candidates for  BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their \npersonal and family risk. Testing for other high -penetrance genes (ie,  PALB2 , TP53 , PTEN , STK11 , \nand CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.  \nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer. Genes with \na strong testing recommendation are those that confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For \nbreast cancer, the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in multigene panels \nare: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK11 , and  TP53 . Of these,  CDH1 , PTEN , STK11 , and  TP53  are \nassociated with specific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not \nsuggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial ovarian cancer, the more strongly \nrecommended genes are:  BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , \nand RAD51D . Testing for  BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma and prostate cancer, and testing for  PALB2  is strongly recommended for pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma. The authors note including  BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and Lynch syndrome genes \n(ie, MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and  EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is \nreasonable due to their importance and prevalence.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   28 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nNational  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  \nBreast  Cancer  and Ovarian  Cancer  \nCurrent  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (NCCN)  (v.3.202 4) guidelines  on the genetic  and \nfamilial  high -risk assessment  of breast,  ovarian,  and pancreatic  cancers  include  criteria  for identifying  \nindividuals  who  should  be referred  for further  risk assessment  and separate  criteria  for genetic  \ntesting.85, Patients  who  satisfy  any of the testing  criteria  listed  in CRIT -1 through  CRIT -4 should  undergo  \n“further  personalized  risk assessment,  genetic  counseling,  and often  genetic  testing  and management.”  \nFor these  criteria,  both  invasive  and in situ breast  cancers  were  included.  Maternal  and paternal  sides  of \nthe family  should  be considered  independently  for familial  patterns  of cancer.  Testing  of unaffected  \nindividuals  should  be considered  \"when  no appropriate  affected  family  member  is available  for testing.”  \nThe recommendations  are for testing  high  penetrance  breast  cancer  susceptibility  genes,  specifically  \nBRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN , STK11  and TP53 . Use of \"tailored  panels  that are disease -focused  \nand include  clinically  actionable  cancer  susceptibility  genes  is preferred  over  large  panels  that include  \ngenes  of uncertain  clinical  relevance\".  \nThe panel  does  not endorse  population  based  testing,  stating  instead  that the panel,  \"continues  to \nendorse  a risk-stratified  approach  and does  not endorse  universal  testing  of all patients  with  breast  \ncancer  due to limitations  of this approach,  such  as low specificity,  shortages  in trained  genetics  health  \nprofessionals  to provide  appropriate  pre- and post -test genetic  counseling,  and lack of evidence  to \nsupport  risk management  for genes  included  in many  multi -gene  panels.\"  \nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic  only  variants  are uncommon.  The NCCN  recommends  if a somatic  variant  is \nidentified  through  tumor  profiling,  then  BRCA1  and BRCA2  germline  testing  is recommended.  \nAdditionally,  the NCCN  ovarian  cancer  guidelines  (v.2.202 4) recommend  tumor  molecular  testing  for \npersistent/recurrent  disease  (OV-6) and describe  in multiple  algorithms  that testing  should  include  at \nleast  BRCA1 /2, homologous  recombination,  microsatellite  instability,  tumor  mutational  burden,  and \nneurotrophic  tyrosine  receptor  kinase  , (OV-6, OV-7, OV-B Principles  of Pathology,  OV-C Principles  of \nSystemic  Therapy).86, \nPancreatic  Adenocarcinoma  and Pancreatic  Neuroendocrine  Tumors  \nCurrent  NCCN  guidelines  for pancreatic  adenocarcinoma  (v.2.202 4) refers  to the NCCN  guidelines  on \ngenetic/familial  high -risk assessment  of breast,  ovarian,  and pancreatic  cancers  detailed  above,  and \nstate:  “The  panel  recommends  germline  testing  in any patient  with  confirmed  pancreatic  cancer  and in \nthose  in whom  there  is a clinical  suspicion  for inherited  susceptibility.\"  The panel  recommends\"using  \ncomprehensive  gene  panels  for hereditary  cancer  syndromes.\"87, \nThe NCCN  guidelines  for genetic  and familial  high -risk assessment  of breast,  ovarian,  and pancreatic  \ncancers  (v.3.202 4) includes  that germline  testing  is clinically  indicated  for individuals  with  \nneuroendocrine  pancreatic  cancers  per the NCCN  guidelines  on neuroendocrine  and adrenal  tumors.88, \nThe NCCN  guidelines  for neuroendocrine  and adrenal  tumors  (v.1.202 4) states,  \"consider  genetic  risk \nevaluation  and genetic  testing:  In a patient  with  duodenal/pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumor  at any \nage\",  noting,  \"studies  of unselected  patients  with  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumors  have  identified  \ngermline  variants  in 16% -17%  of cases.  However,  these  studies  involved  relatively  small  cohorts  of \npatients.\"  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   29 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nProstate  Cancer  \nThe current  NCCN  guidelines  for prostate  cancer  are version  1.202 4.89, The Principles  of Genetics  and \nMolecular/Biomarker  Analysis  section  (PROS -C ) provides  appropriate  scenarios  for germline  genetic  \ntesting  in individuals  with  a personal  history  of prostate  cancer.  \nAmerican  Society  of Breast  Surgeons  \nA consensus  guideline  on genetic  testing  for hereditary  breast  cancer  was updated  in February  2019.90, \nThe guideline  states  that genetic  testing  should  be made  available  to all patients  with  a personal  history  \nof breast  cancer  and that such  testing  should  include  BRCA1 /BRCA2  and PALB2 , with  other  genes  as \nappropriate  for the clinical  scenario  and patient  family  history.  Furthermore,  patients  who  had previous  \ngenetic  testing  may  benefit  from  updated  testing.  Finally,  genetic  testing  should  be made  available  to \npatients  without  a personal  history  of breast  cancer  when  they  meet  NCCN  guideline  criteria.  The \nguidelines  also note  that variants  of uncertain  significance  are not clinically  actionable.  \nSociety  of Gynecologic  Oncology  \nIn 2015,  the Society  of Gynecologic  Oncology  (SGO)  published  an evidence -based  consensus  statement  \non risk assessment  for inherited  gynecologic  cancer.91, The statement  included  criteria  for \nrecommending  genetic  assessment  (counseling  with  or without  testing)  to patients  who  may  be \ngenetically  predisposed  to breast  or ovarian  cancer.  Overall,  the SGO  and the NCCN  recommendations  \nare very  similar;  the main  differences  are the exclusion  of women  with  breast  cancer  onset  at age 50 \nyears  or younger  who  have  1 or more  first-, second -, or third -degree  relatives  with  breast  cancer  at any \nage;  women  with  breast  cancer  or history  of breast  cancer  who  have  a first-, second -, or third -degree  \nmale  relative  with  breast  cancer;  and men  with  a personal  history  of breast  cancer.  Additionally,  SGO  \nrecommended  genetic  assessment  for unaffected  women  who  have  a male  relative  with  breast  cancer.  \nMoreover,  SGO  indicated  that some  patients  who  do not satisfy  criteria  may  still benefit  from  genetic  \nassessment  (e.g., few female  relatives,  hysterectomy,  or oophorectomy  at a young  age in multiple  family  \nmembers,  or adoption  in the lineage).  \nAmerican  College  of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists  \nThe American  College  of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists  (2017,  reaffirmed  2021  ) published  a Practice  \nBulletin  on hereditary  breast  and ovarian  cancer  syndrome.92, The following  recommendation  was based  \nprimarily  on consensus  and expert  opinion  (level  C): “Genetic  testing  is recommended  when  the results  \nof a detailed  risk assessment  that is performed  as part of genetic  counseling  suggest  the presence  of an \ninherited  cancer  syndrome  for which  specific  genes  have  been  identified  and when  the results  of testing  \nare likely  to influence  medical  management.”  \nU.S. Preventive  Services  Task  Force  \nCurrent  U.S. Preventative  Services  Task  Force  (USPSTF)  recommendations  (2019)93, for genetic  testing  of \nBRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  in women  state:  \n\"The  USPSTF  recommends  that primary  care  clinicians  assess  women  with  a personal  or family  history  of \nbreast,  ovarian,  tubal,  or peritoneal  cancer  or who  have  an ancestry  associated  with  BRCA1 /2 gene  \nmutation  with  an appropriate  brief  familial  risk assessment  tool.

The  PALB2  gene is located at 16p12.2 and has 13 exons. PALB2 protein \nassists  BRCA2  in DNA repair and tumor suppression. Families with hereditary breast and ovarian \ncancer syndrome have an increased susceptibility to the following types of cancer: breast cancer \noccurring at a young age, bilateral breast cancer, male breast cancer, ovaria n cancer (at any \nage), cancer of the fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, \ngastrointestinal cancers, melanoma, and laryngeal cancer.  \n \n \nOBJECTIVE  \nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether germline genetic testing \nfor BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or PALB2  variants improves the net health outcomes in individuals with \ncancer or who have a personal or family history of cancer, which might suggest hereditary \nbreast/  and ovarian cancer syndrome or other high -risk cancers.  \n \n \nBACKGROUND  \n \nHereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  \nSeveral genetic syndromes with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that features \nbreast cancer have been identified. Of these, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) \nsyndrome and some cases of hereditary site -specific breast cancer have in co mmon causative \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 3 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.  All Rights Reserved.  \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Kansas is a n independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  \n \nContains Public Information  variants in  BRCA  (breast cancer susceptibility) genes. Families suspected of having HBOC \nsyndrome are characterized by an increased susceptibility to breast cancer occurring at a young \nage, bilateral breast cancer, male breast cancer, ovarian cancer at any age, as well as  cancer of \nthe fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer. Other cancers, such as prostate cancer, \npancreatic cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, melanoma, and laryngeal cancer, occur more \nfrequently in HBOC families. Hereditary site -specific breast cancer  families are characterized by \nearly-onset breast cancer with or without male cases, but without ovarian cancer.  \n \nGermline variants in the  BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes are responsible for the cancer susceptibility in \nmost HBOC families, especially if ovarian cancer or male breast cancer are features. However, in \nsite-specific cancer, BRCA variants are responsible only for a proportion of affected families. \nBRCA  gene variants are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion through maternal or \npaternal lineage. It is possible to test for abnormalities in BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes to identify \nthe specific variant in cancer cases and to identify family members at increased cancer risk. \nFamily members without existing cancer who are found to have  BRCA  variants can consider \npreventive interventions for reducing risk and mortality.  \n \nEvidence suggests that genetic services are not equitably applied. Chapman -Davis et al (2021) \nfound that non -Hispanic Whites and Asians were more likely to be referred for genetic services \nbased solely on family history than were non -Hispanic Blacks and Hi spanics.1, In addition, non -\nHispanic Black patients and Hispanic patients were more likely to have advanced cancer when \nreferred for genetic services than non-Hispanic Whites and Asians.  \n \nClinical Features Suggestive of  BRCA  Variant  \nYoung age of onset of breast cancer, even in the absence of family history, is a risk factor \nfor BRCA1  variants. Winchester (1996) estimated that hereditary breast cancers account for \n36% to 85% of patients diagnosed before age 30 years.2, In several studies,  BRCA  variants were \nindependently predicted by early age at onset, being present in 6% to 10% of breast cancer \ncases diagnosed at ages younger than various premenopausal age cutoffs (age range, 35 to 50 \nyears).2,3,4,5, In cancer -prone families, the mean age of breast cancer diagnosis among women \ncarrying  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants is in the 40s.6, In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, Frank et al \n(2002) reported that 13% of 248 cases with no known family history and diagnosed before 50 \nyears of age had  BRCA  variants.3, In a similar study by Gershoni -Baruch et al (2000), 31% of \nAshkenazi Jewish women, unselected for family history, diagnosed with breast cancer at \nyounger than 42 years of age had  BRCA  variants.7, Other studies have indicated that early age \nof breast cancer diagnosis is a significant predictor of BRCA variants in the absence of family \nhistory in this population.8,9,10,  \n \nAs in the general population, a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, particularly of early \nage onset, is a significant risk factor for a  BRCA  variant in ethnic populations characterized by \nfounder mutations. For example, in unaffected individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, 12% to \n31% will have a  BRCA  variant depending on the extent and nature of the family history.5, \nSeveral other studies have documented the significant influence of family history.7,8,9,10,11,  \n \nIn patients with “triple -negative” breast cancer ( i.e., negative for expression of estrogen, \nprogesterone, and overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 receptors), \nthere is an increased prevalence of  BRCA  variants. Pathophysiologic research has suggested that \nthe physiologic pathway for the development of triple -negative breast cancer is similar to that \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 4 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.  All Rights Reserved.  \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Kansas is a n independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  \n \nContains Public Information  for BRCA -associated breast cancer.12, In 200 randomly selected patients with triple -negative \nbreast cancer from a tertiary care center, Kandel et al (2006) reported that there was a greater \nthan 3 -fold increase in the expected rate of  BRCA  variants.13,BRCA1  variants were found in \n39.1% of patients and  BRCA2  variants in 8.7%. Young et al (2009) studied 54 women with high -\ngrade, triple -negative breast cancer with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer, \nrepresenting a group that previously was not recommended for BRCA  testing.14, Six BRCA  \nvariants (5  BRCA1 , 1 BRCA2 ) were found, for a variant rate of 11%. Finally, Gonzalez -Angulo et \nal (2011) in a study of 77 patients with triple -negative breast cancer, reported that 15 patients \n(19.5%) had  BRCA  variants (12 in  BRCA1 , 3 in BRCA2 ).15, \n \nPALB2  Gene  \nThe PALB2  gene (partner and localizer of  BRCA2 ) encodes for a protein first described in \n2006.16, The gene is located at 16p12.2 [Short (p) arm of chromosome 16 at position 12.2.] and \nhas 13 exons. PALB2 protein assists  BRCA2  in DNA repair and tumor suppression. Heterozygous \npathogenic  PALB2  variants increase the risk of developing breast and pancreatic cancers; \nhomozygous variants are found in Fanconi anemia. Fanconi anemia is a rare disorder, primarily \naffecting children, that causes bone marrow failure. Affected individuals also carry a ris k of \ncancers including leukemia. Most pathogenic  PALB2  variants are truncating frameshift or stop \ncodons and  are found throughout the gene. Pathogenic  PALB2  variants are uncommon in \nunselected populations and prevalence varies by ethnicity and family history. For example, \nAntoniou et al (2014) assumed a prevalence of 8 per 10,000 in the general population when \nmodeling breast cancer risks.17, Variants are more prevalent in ethnic populations where founder \nmutations have persisted ( e.g., Finns, French Canadians, Poles), while infrequently found in \nothers ( e.g., Ashkenazi Jews).18,19, In women with a family history of breast cancer, the \nprevalence of pathogenic  PALB2  variants ranges between 0.9% and 3.9%,17, or substantially \nhigher than in an unselected general population. Depending on population prevalence, \nPALB2  may be responsible for as much as 2.4% of hereditary breast cancers17,, and in \npopulations with founder mutations cause 0.5% to 1% of all breast cancers.20, \n \n \nREGULATORY STATUS  \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in -house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory -developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments. Genetic tests reviewed in this evidence review are \navailable under the auspices of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Labo ratories \nthat offer laboratory -developed tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement \nAmendments for high -complexity testing.

There are differences in the position statements above and the National Comprehensive \nCancer Network (NCCN) guideline on Genetic/Familial High -Risk Assessment: Breast, \nOvarian, and Pancreatic (v.3.202 4). Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for \ndetermining hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy.  \nTesting for  BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or  PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all \nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast \ncancer under the age of 50 years,  may be indicated for guiding cancer therapies.  \nAdditionally, conflicting criteria reflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited \nor no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of \ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.  \n \nB. Current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines recommend screening \nwomen with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer  or \nwho have an ancestry associated with  BRCA1/2  gene mutation.  Women with positive \nscreening result  on the risk assessment tool  should receive genetic counseling and, if \nindicated after counseling, genetic testing ( B Recommendation) . \n \nC. Recommended screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated \nwith an increased risk for potentially harmful  variants  in BRCA1  or BRCA2  are: \n1. Ontario Family History Assessment Tool (FHAT)  \n2. Manchester Scoring System  \n3. Referral Screening Tool (RST)  \n4. Pedigree Assessment Tool (PAT)  \n5. Family History Screen ( FHS-7) \n6. International Breast Cancer Intervention Study instrument (Tyrer -Cuziak)  \n7. Brief versions of the BRCAPRO  \n \nD. Close Relatives :  Close relatives are blood related family members including 1st -, 2nd-, \nand 3rd -degree relatives on the same side of the family (maternal or paternal).  \n1. 1st-degree relatives are parents, siblings, and children.  \n2. 2nd-degree relatives are grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, \ngrandchildren, and half -siblings.  \n3. 3rd-degree relatives are great -grandparents, great -aunts, great-uncles, great -\ngrandchildren, and first cousins.  \n \nE. Prostate Cancer Risk Groups:  Risk groups for prostate cancer in this policy include high -\nrisk groups and very -high-risk groups.  \n1. High-risk group: no very -high-risk features and are T3a (American Joint Committee \non Cancer staging T3a = tumor has extended outside of the prostate but has not \nspread to the seminal vesicles); OR Grade Group 4 or 5; OR prostate specific antigen \nof 20 ng/m L or greater . \n2. Very-high-risk group: T3b -T4 (tumor invades seminal vesicle(s); or tumor is fixed or \ninvades adjacent structures other than seminal vesicles such as external sphincter, \nrectum, bladder, levator muscles, and/or pelvic wall); OR Primary Gleason Pattern 5; \nOR 2 or 3 high -risk features; OR greater than 4 cores with Grade Group 4 or 5  \n \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 8 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

Recommended Testing Strategies: Individual s who meet criteria for genetic testing as \noutlined in the policy statements above should be tested for variants in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and \nPALB2 . Recommended strategies are listed below.  \n1. In individual s with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the \nspecific variant is recommended.  \n2. In individual s with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant : \na. To identify clinically significant variants, National Comprehensive Cancer \nNetwork (NCCN) advises testing a relative who has early -onset disease, \nbilateral disease, multiple primaries, because that individual has the highest \nlikelihood of obtaining a posit ive test result.  Unless the affected individual is \na member of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or \nlikely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic testing \n(i.e., full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene \nrearrangements) should be performed  \nb. If no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN \nsuggests testing first - or second -degree family members affected with \ncancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants ( e.g., \nprostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma).  \nc. If no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:  \nI. Full sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large \ngenomic rearrangements (deletions/duplications) only if sequencing \ndetects no variant (negative result).  \ni. More than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full \nsequencing.  \nII. Alternatively, simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large \ngenomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  \ntesting; see Comprehensive Variant Analysis, below ) may be \nperformed as is recommended by NCCN.  \ni. Comprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  \nvariants.  \nd. Testing for  BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial \ntesting might be preferred for efficiency. Multi -gene panels often include \ngenes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on \nwhich to base management decisions. When considering a gene panel, \nNCCN re commends use of \"tailored panels that are disease -focused and \ninclude clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".  \ne. Ashkenazi Jewish descent  \nI. In individual s of know Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to \ntest for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC in \nBRCA1; 6174delT in BRCA2) first.  \nII. If testing is negative for founder mutations  and if the individual's \nancestry also included non -Ashkenazi ethnicity ( or if othe r BRCA1/2  \ntesting criteria are met),  comprehensive genetic testing may should \nbe considered  \nf. Testing strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above \ncriteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological \nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals \nwith presumed paternal transmission.  \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 9 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.  All Rights Reserved.  \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Kansas is a n independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  \n \nContains Public Information   \nG. Comprehensive Variant  Analysis :  Comprehensive variant analysis currently includes \nsequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect \nlarge deletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In \naddition, before August 20 06, testing for large deletions and rearrangements was not \nperformed, thus some individual s with familial breast cancer who had negative  BRCA  testing \nbefore this time may consider repeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for \ncriteria).  \n \nH. High -Risk Ethnic G roups:  Testing of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations \nin which there are well -characterized founder mutations should begin with tests specifically \nfor these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three -\nquarters of the  BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi Jewish populations (see Rationale \nsection). When testing for founder mutations is negative, comprehensive variant analysis \nshould then be performed.  \n \nI. Testing Unaffected I ndividuals : In unaffected family members of potential  BRCA   or \nPALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is \nstrongly recommended that an  affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to \nadequately interpret the test. Should a  BRCA  or PALB2 variant  be found in an affected \nfamily member(s), DNA from an  unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the \nsame variant of the affected family member without having to sequence the entire gene. \nInterpreting test results for an unaffected family member without knowing the genetic \nstatus of the family may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established \ndisease -associated variant but leads to difficulties in interpreting negative tes t results \n(uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a \ncausative  BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.  \n \nTesting for known variants of  BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaffected reproductive partner \nmay be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal recessive conditions.  \n \nJ. Testing Minors:  The use of genetic testing for  BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2 variants for \nidentifying hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome  has limited or no clinical utility in \nminors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of \nthe presence or absence of a deleterious variant. In addition, there are potential harms \nrelated to stigmatization and discrimination.  \n \nK. Prostate C ancer : Individual s with  BRCA   or PALB2 variants have an increased risk of \nprostate cancer, and individuals  with known  BRCA   or PALB2 variants may, therefore, \nconsider more aggressive screening approaches for prostate cancer.  \n \nL. Genetics Nomenclature Update:  The Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is \nused to report information on variants found in DNA and serves as an international standard \nin DNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review \nupdates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's nomenclature is recommended by \nthe Human Variome Project, the H uman Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome \nVariation Society itself.  \n \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 10 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

Genetic Counseling:  Genetic counseling is primarily aimed at patients who are at risk for \ninherited disorders, and experts recommend formal genetic counseling in most cases when \ngenetic testing for an inherited condition is considered. The interpretation of the results of \ngenetic tests and the understanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. \nTherefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits \nand harms of genetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the \nindividual’s family. Genetic couns eling may alter the utilization of genetic testing \nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed \nby an individual with experience and expertise in genetic medicine and genetic testing \nmethods.  \n \n \nPlease refer to the member's contract benefits in effect at the time of service to determine \ncoverage or non -coverage of these services as it applies to an individual member.  \n \n \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 11 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

The \nmost recent literature update was performed through  June 12, 2024.  \n \nThis review was informed by a TEC Assessment (1997).21, \n \nEvidence reviews assess whether a medical test is clinically useful. A useful test provides \ninformation to make a clinical management decision that improves the net health outcome. That \nis, the balance of benefits and harms is better when the test is used to manage the condition \nthan when another test or no test is used to manage the condition.  \n \nThe first step in assessing a medical test is to formulate the clinical context and purpose of the \ntest. The test must be technically reliable, clinically valid, and clinically useful for that purpose. \nEvidence reviews assess the evidence on whether a test  is clinically valid and clinically useful. \nTechnical reliability is outside the scope of these reviews, and credible information on technical \nreliability is available from other sources.  \n \nPromotion of greater diversity and inclusion in clinical research of historically marginalized groups \n(e.g., People of Color [African -American, Asian, Black, Latino and Native American]; LGBTQIA \n(Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, Asexua l); Women; and People with \nDisabilities [Physical and Invisible]) allows policy populations to be more reflective of and findings \nmore applicable to our diverse members. While we also strive to use inclusive language related to \nthese groups in our policies , use of gender -specific nouns (e.g., women, men, sisters, etc.) will \ncontinue when reflective of language used in publications describing study populations.  \n \nTESTING FOR  BRCA1  AND  BRCA2  VARIANTS IN INDIVIDUALS AT RISK FOR \nHEREDITARY BREAST/OVARIAN CANCER SYNDROME OR OTHER HIGH -RISK \nCANCERS  \n \nClinical Context and Test Purpose  \nThe purpose of testing for  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in individuals at high -risk for hereditary \nbreast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome is to evaluate whether variants are present and if \nso, to determine the appropriate surveillance and treatment to decrease the risk of mortality from \nbreast and/ or ovarian cancer.  \n \nThe following PICO was used to select literature to inform this review.  \n \nPopulations  \nThe relevant population of interest is individuals with cancer ( i.e., breast cancer, epithelial \novarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer), or individuals with a personal or family history \nof cancer and criteria that might suggest they are at risk for HBOC syndrome.  \n \nInterventions  \nThe intervention of interest is  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant testing.  \n \nFor patients without a cancer diagnosis who are assessing cancer risk, results may guide \npotential prophylactic measures such as surveillance, chemoprevention, or prophylactic \nmastectomy, and/or oophorectomy.  \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 12 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.  All Rights Reserved.  \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Kansas is a n independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  \n \nContains Public Information   \nFor patients with a cancer diagnosis, results may guide treatment decisions.  \n \nTesting for  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants is conducted in adults when appropriate treatment and/or \nprophylactic treatment options are available.  \n \nComparators  \nThe following practice is currently being used to manage HBOC syndrome or other high -risk \ncancers: standard of care without genetic testing.  \n \nOutcomes  \nThe outcomes of interest are overall survival (OS), disease -specific (breast and ovarian cancer) \nsurvival, test validity, and quality of life (QOL; e.g., anxiety).  \n \nStudy Selection Criteria  \nFor the evaluation of clinical validity, studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk were included. \nFor the evaluation of clinical utility, studies that represent the intended clinical use of the \ntechnology in the intended population were included. The q uality and credibility of the evidence \ndepend on study design and conduct, minimizing bias and confounding that can generate \nincorrect findings.  \n \nEvidence for the 2 indications is presented together because there is overlap in the evidence base \nfor the 2 populations: (1) patients at risk for HBOC syndrome, and (2) patients with other high -\nrisk cancers such as cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas,  and prostate.  \n \nClinically Valid  \nA test must detect the presence or absence of a condition, the risk of developing a condition in \nthe future, or treatment response (beneficial or adverse).  \n \nREVIEW OF EVIDENCE  \n \nPrevalence of  BRCA  Variants and Risks of Cancer and Survival  \nThe prevalence of  BRCA  variants is approximately 0.1% to 0.2% in the general population. The \nprevalence may be much higher for particular ethnic groups with characterized founder mutations \n(e.g., 2.5% [1/40] in the Ashkenazi Jewish population). A family history of breast and ovarian \ncancer is an important risk factor for the  BRCA  variant; additionally, age and ethnicity could be \nindependent risk factors.  \n \nSystematic Reviews  \nA systematic review published by Zhu et al (2016) found a significantly lower risk of OS in breast \ncancer patients with  BRCA1  (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 1.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35 \nto 2.12) and with  BRCA2  (pooled HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.09; p=.034).22, However, in \npatients with breast cancer,  BRCA1  and BRCA2  were not associated with a lower breast cancer -\nspecific survival.  \n \nNelson et al (2013) conducted a systematic review that included meta -analytic estimates of the \nprevalence and penetrance of  BRCA  variants; this review was used to update the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for risk assessment, genetic counseling, and \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 13 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.  All Rights Reserved.  \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Kansas is a n independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  \n \nContains Public Information  genetic testing for  BRCA -related cancer.23, In high -risk women with positive test results, \ncumulative risks for developing breast cancer by age 70 years were 46% for  BRCA1  and 50% for \nBRCA2 when a single family member was tested, and 70% for  BRCA1  and 71% for  BRCA2 when \nmultiple family members were tested; cumulative risks for developing ovarian cancer by age 70 \nyears were 41% for  BRCA1  and 17% for  BRCA2  when a single family member was tested; and \n46% for  BRCA1  and 23% for  BRCA2  when multiple family members were tested. For Ashkenazi \nJewish women with positive test results,  cumulative risks for developing breast or ovarian cancer \nby age 75 years were 34% and 21%, respectively. Nelson et al (2013) included meta -analytic \nestimates of  BRCA  prevalence in their review for USPSTF. In unselected women,  BRCA  variant \nprevalence estimates were 0.2% to 0.3%; in women with breast cancer, 1.8% for  BRCA1  and \n1.3% for  BRCA2 ; in women with breast cancer onset at age 40 years or younger, 6%; in women \nfrom high -risk families, 13.6% for  BRCA1 , 7.9% for  BRCA2 , and 19.8% for  BRCA1  or BRCA2 ; in \nunselected Ashkenazi Jewish women, 2.1%; and in Ashkenazi Jewish women from high -risk \nfamilies, 10.2%.  \n \nEstimates of lifetime risk of cancer for  BRCA  variant carriers (penetrance), based on studies of \nfamilies with an extensive history of the disease, have been as high as 85%. For example, \nKuchenbaecker et al (2017) found that the cumulative risk of breast cancer up to age 80 years \nwas 72% in  BRCA1  carriers and 69% in  BRCA2  carriers.24, Because other factors that influence \nrisk may be present in families with extensive breast and ovarian cancer histories, early \npenetrance estimates may have been biased upward .25, Studies of founder mutations in ethnic \npopulations ( e.g., Ashkenazi Jewish, Polish, Icelandic populations) unselected for family history \nhave indicated lower penetrance estimates, in the range of 40% to 60% for  BRCA1  and 25% to \n40% for  BRCA2.8,11,26,27, However, a genotyping study of Ashkenazi Jewish women with incident \ninvasive breast cancer, selected regardless of family history of cancer and their family members, \nresulted in an 82% lifetime risk of breast cancer for carriers of any of 3  BRCA  founder  mutations \n(185delAG, 5382insC, 6174delT).27, Importantly, the risk of cancer in variant carriers from \nfamilies with little history of cancer (>50% of all carriers) did not differ significantly. Lifetime risk \nestimates of ovarian cancer were 54% for  BRCA1  and 23% for  BRCA2  variant carriers.  \n \nProspective Studies  \nWomen with a history of breast cancer and a  BRCA  variant have a significant risk of contralateral \nbreast cancer. In a prospective study by Metcalfe et al (2004), the 10 -year risk was 29.5% for \nwomen with initial stage I or II diseases.28, In a prospective study, Epidemiological Study of \nFamilial Breast Cancer, Mavaddat et al (2013) reported that the cumulative risk of contralateral \nbreast cancer by age 70 years was 83% in the  BRCA1  variant carriers, and 62% for  BRCA2  \nvariant carriers.29, These investigators also reported cumulative risks of breast cancer by age 70 \nyears in women without pr evious cancer (60% in  BRCA1  carriers, 55% in  BRCA2  carriers). \nSimilarly, the cumulative risk estimates of ovarian cancer by age 70 years in women without \nprevious ovarian cancer were 59% for  BRCA1  carriers and 17% for  BRCA2  carriers.  \n \nBRCA  Variant Rates Associated With Ovarian Cancer  \nWomen with a personal history of ovarian cancer have an increased rate of  BRCA  variants. In a \nsystematic review of 23 studies, Trainer et al (2010) estimated the rate of  BRCA  variants among \nwomen with ovarian cancer   3% to 15%.30, In this review, 3 U.S. studies tested for \nboth BRCA1  and BRCA2 ; incidences of  BRCA  variants were 11.3%, 15.3%, and 9.5%. In the \nsystematic review for USPSTF by Nelson et al (2013), meta -analytic estimates of  BRCA  \nprevalence among women with ovarian cancer were 4.4% for  BRCA1  and 5.6% for  BRCA2.23, \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 14 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

Reviewers noted that these findings supported \nother studies that have demonstrated the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube as an important site \nof cancer in those with  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.  \n \nA long -term study by Powell et al (2013; median follow -up, 7 years; range, 3 to 14 years) \nfollowed 32  BRCA  variant carriers with occult malignancy (4 ovarian, 23 fallopian tube, 5 ovarian \nand fallopian tube) diagnosed of prophylactic salpingo -oophorectomy.37, Among 15 women with \ninvasive carcinoma (median age, 50 years), 7 (47%) experienced recurrence at a median of 33 \nmonths, and OS was 73%. Among 17 women with noninvasive neoplasia (median age, 53 years), \n4 (24%) received chemotherapy, none of whom experienc ed recurrence. One (6%) patient who \ndid not receive chemotherapy experienced recurrence at 43 months. OS was 100%. The authors  \nconcluded that, in  BRCA  variant carriers, unsuspected invasive carcinoma has a relatively high \nrate of recurrence, but noninvasive neoplasms rarely recur and may not require adjuvant \nchemotherapy.  \n \nBRCA  Variant Rates Associated With Pancreatic Cancer  \nUnaffected individuals also may be at high -risk due to other patterns of non -breast -cancer \nmalignancies.

For example, Walsh et al (2006) \nreported on probands from 300 U.S. families with 4 or more cases of breast or ovarian cancer but \nwith negative (wild -type) commercial genetic tests for  BRCA1  and BRCA2 .48, These patients \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 16 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

Of these 300 \npatients, 17% carried previously undetected variants, including 35 (12%) with genomic \nrearrangement of  BRCA1  or BRCA2 . \n \nA study by Palma et al (2008) evaluated 251 patients with an estimated  BRCA  variant prevalence \nusing the Myriad II model of at least 10%.49, In 136 non -Ashkenazi Jewish probands, 36 (26%) \nhad BRCA  point mutations and 8 (6%) had genomic rearrangements (7 in  BRCA1 , 1 in BRCA2 ). \nGenomic rearrangements comprised 18% of all identified  BRCA  variants. No genomic \nrearrangements were identified in the 115 Ashkenazi Jewish probands, but 47 (40%) had point \nmutations. The authors indicated that the estimated prevalence  of a variant did not predict the \npresence of a genomic rearrangement.  \n \nClinically Useful  \nA test is clinically useful if the use of the results informs management decisions that improve the \nnet health outcome of care. The net health outcome can be improved if patients receive correct \ntherapy, or more effective therapy, or avoid unnecessary therapy, or avoid unnecessary testing.  \n \nDirect Evidence  \nDirect evidence of clinical utility is provided by studies that have compared health outcomes for \npatients managed with and without the test. Because these are intervention studies, the \npreferred evidence would be from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In their systematic review \nfor the USPSTF, Nelson et al (2019) confirmed that they identified no studies that compared \nhealth outcomes for patients managed with and without  BRCA  variant testing.50, \n \nKnowledge of variant status in individuals at potentially increased risk of a  BRCA  variant may \nimpact health care decisions to reduce risk.51,52,53,54,55,56,57, Risk-reducing options include intensive \nsurveillance, chemoprevention, prophylactic mastectomy, or prophylactic oophorectomy.  \n \nProphylactic mastectomy reduces the risk of breast cancer in high -risk women (based on family \nhistory) by 90%.52, Prophylactic oophorectomy significantly reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by \n80% or more55,56,58, and reduces the risk of breast cancer by approximately 50%.56, In women \nwho have already had breast cancer, prophylactic oophorectomy reduces the risk of cancer \nrelapse.42, Prophylactic oophorectomy or salpingo -oophorectomy in women with  BRCA1  or BRCA2  \nreduced the risk of all -cause mortality by 60%  to 77%.58,59, For patients at risk for both breast \nand ovarian cancer, a study by Elmi et al (2018), drawing on data from the American College of \nSurgeon’s National Surgical Quality Improvement Program dataset, found that prophylactic \nmastectomy with concurrent salpingo -oophorectomy was not associated with significant \nadditional morbidity compared with prophylactic mastectomy alone.60, \n \nSystematic reviews of observational studies comparing prophylactic surgeries with observation in \nwomen who had  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants have demonstrated that contralateral prophylactic \nmastectomy in women with breast cancer is associated with significantly lower all -cause mortality \nwhile bilateral prophylactic mastectomy was not associated with all -cause mortality.61,62,63, Studies \nhave indicated that the results of genotyping significantly influenced treatment choices.53,64,57,  \n \nIn a systematic review for the USPSTF, Nelson et al (2019) assessed the efficacy of risk -reducing \nsurgery in  BRCA -positive women.50, The literature search was conducted through March 2019. A \ntotal of 13 observational studies (n=9938) provided consistent and moderate -strength evidence \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 17 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.  All Rights Reserved.  \nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Kansas is a n independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  \n \nContains Public Information  of the benefits of risk -reducing surgery. For high -risk women and variant carriers, bilateral \nmastectomy reduced breast cancer incidence by 90% to 100% and breast cancer mortality by \n81% to 100%; oophorectomy or salpingo -oophorectomy reduced breast cancer incidence by \n37% to 83%, ovarian cancer incidence by 69% to 100%. Some women experienced reduced \nanxiety. Limitations of the studies of benefits included lack of comparison groups, variations in \nmethodology and enrollment criteria, and heterogeneous outcom e measures. Additionally, a total \nof 14 observational studies (n=3073) provided low -strength evidence of the harms of risk -\nreducing surgery. Adverse events included physical complications of the surgery, postsurgical \nsymptoms, and changes in body image. St udies of harms shared the same limitations as the \nstudies of benefits as noted above, with the addition that their findings were inconsistent and the \nsample sizes were smaller. As reviewers observed, it is still currently unknown whether  BRCA  \nvariant testi ng reduces cause -specific or all -cause mortality, or if it improves the QOL. Harms \nassociated with false -negative results or variants of uncertain significance also are unknown.  \n \nOther studies have looked at the results of prostate cancer screening in men with  BRCA  variants. \nThe Immunotherapy for Prostate Adenocarcinoma Treatment study (2011) evaluated the results \nof screening in 205 men 40 to 69 years of age who were  BRCA  variant carriers and 95 control \npatients.65, At the baseline screen, biopsies were performed in 7.0% of men with a prostate -\nspecific antigen level greater than 3.0 ng/mL, and prostate cancer was identified in 3.3%. This \nresulted in a positive predictive value of 4 7.6%, which is considerably higher than that estimated \nfor men at normal risk. Moreover, the grade of tumor identified was intermediate in 67% of \ncancers and high in 11%. This differs from the expected distribution of cancer grade in average -\nrisk men, with  more than 60% expected to have low -grade cancer.  \n \nSection Summary: Testing for  BRCA1  and BRCA2  Variants in Individuals at Risk for \nHereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome or Other High -Risk Cancers  \nEvidence for the clinical validity of  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant testing consists of multiple studies \nthat calculated  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant prevalence among samples of patients with HBOC \nsyndrome, fallopian tube cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer.  \n \nRegarding clinical utility of  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant testing, current evidence has not directly \nevaluated management with and without genetic testing. In terms of prophylactic measures \n(mastectomy and oophorectomy), RCTs would be difficult to conduct. However, retrospective \nanalyses have shown that prophylactic mastectomy and/or oophorectomy greatly reduced the \nrisk of breast cancer (90% to 100%) and ovarian cancer (69% to 100%).  \n \nPALB2  AND BREAST CANCER RISK ASSESSMENT  \n \nClinical Context and Test Purpose  \nThe purpose of testing for  PALB2  variants in women at high -risk of HBOC syndrome is to \nevaluate whether an abnormal variant is present and, if so, to determine whether the variant \nconveys a sufficiently high -risk such that changes in surveillance and/or treatment that are likely \nto decrease the risk of mortality from breast cancer are warranted.  \n \nPotential benefit derives from interventions (screening, chemoprevention, risk -reducing surgery) \nthat can prevent first breast cancer, contralateral breast cancer, or cancer in a different organ \ncaused by the same variant.

Testing may also be considered for women from families with known \nvariants.  \n \nThe relevant population of interest for this review are individuals who are undergoing assessment \nfor HBOC syndrome.  \n \nInterventions  \nThe intervention of interest is  PALB2  variant testing.  \n \nComparators  \nThe alternative would be to manage women at high -risk of HBOC syndrome with \nno PALB2  genetic testing.  \n \nOutcomes  \nThe outcomes of interest are OS, disease -specific (breast and ovarian cancer) survival, and test \nvalidity.  \n \nStudy Selection Criteria  \nFor the evaluation of the clinical validity of the tests, studies that meet the following eligibility \ncriteria were considered:  \n• Included a suitable reference standard  \n• Patient/sample clinical characteristics were described with women at high breast cancer \nrisk \n• Patient/sample selection criteria were described.  \n \nClinically Valid  \nA test must detect the presence or absence of a condition, the risk of developing a condition in \nthe future, or treatment response (beneficial or adverse).  \n \nREVIEW OF EVIDENCE  \n  \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 19 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

The systematic review \nincluded studies published through July 2017 reporting on genetic test results of breast and \novarian cancer patients who were referred for evaluation by a multi -gene panel. Given th at the \nSuszynska et al (2019) report included only studies re porting on test results from a panel, it does \nnot substantially overlap with the studies described in the following section including other  PALB2  \nassociation studies. The studies of panel results were used to calculate mutation frequencies by \nthe gene. As a control, population mutation frequencies were extracted from the Genome \nAggregation Database. Forty -three studies included panels in breast cancer patients. In the \nbreast cancer studies, 95,853 patients were included in the analysis of  PALB2.  PALB2  variants \nwere identified in 0.9% of breast cancer patients. The meta -analytic estimate odds ratio (OR) of \nthe association between  PALB2  variants and risk of breast cancer was 4.8 (95% confidence \ninterval , 4.1 to 5.6).  \n \nObservational Studies  \nA number of studies (Tables 4 and 5) reporting relative risks (RRs) or ORs for the association \nbetween  PALB2  and breast cancer were identified.18,17,19,20,67,68,69,70,71,72,73, Study designs included \nfamily segregation,67,74,, kin-cohort,17, family -based case -control,19,69,75, and population -based or \nmulticenter case -control.18,20,68,70,71,72,73, The 2 multinational studies included individuals from up \nto 5 of the single -country studies.17,71, The number of pathogenic variants identified varied from 1 \n(foun der mutations examined) to 48 (Table 4). Studies conducted from single -country samples \nare described first followed by the 2 multinational collaborative efforts.  \n \nSingle -Country Samples  \nWoodward et al (2021) assessed the contribution of  PALB2  gene variants to familial breast and \novarian cancer.73, A total of 3127 women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of invasive or \nin situ breast cancer or an epithelial nonmucinous ovarian cancer who had undergone germline \ntesting of  BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , and CHEK2 _c.1100delC were included. Cases were identified \nfrom centers in the U.K.  \n \nLi et al (2021) assessed the association between 14 known genes associated with HBOC \nsyndrome in a sample of 1990  BRCA 1/2 -negative family members with breast cancer and/or \novarian cancer and 1902 older women (>40 years of age) who were cancer free at the time of \nthe study.75, The initial assessment in 3892 women was conducted with targeted gene panel \nsequencing, followed by assessment of 145 candidate genes and 14 known HBOC syndrome \ngenes in a sample of 3780  BRCA1  and BRCA2 -negative families and 3839 cont rols. Index cases \nwere identified from Familial Cancer Centers and a Pathology center in Australia, and controls \nwere identified from the LifePool mammography screening study.  \n \nLu et al (2019) included an analysis of 11,416 patients with breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer \nwho were referred for genetic testing from 1200 U.S. hospitals and clinics and of 3988 controls \nreferred for genetic testing for noncancer conditions between 2 014 and 2015.72, Whole -exome \nsequencing was used and suspected pathogenic variants in the breast or ovarian cancer -\nassociated genes were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.  \n \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 20 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

Controls were women from the same database ( i.e., being tested for hereditary cancer) \nwith no cancer history at the time of genetic testing. The multivariable models for breast cancer \nrisk are reported here. Among the breast cancer patients, 244 (0.92%) had a  PALB2  variant. The \nassociation between  PALB2  and breast cancer adjusting for age, ancestry, personal and family \ncancer histories, and Lynch and adenomatous polyposis colon cancer syndromes had an OR of \n3.39 (95% CI, 2.79 to 4.12).  \n \nThompson et al (2015) evaluated Australian women with breast cancer (n=1996) referred for \ngenetic evaluation from 1997 to 2014.70, A control group was accrued from participants in the \nLifePool study (n=1998) who were recruited for a mammography screening program. \nAll PALB2  coding exons were sequenced by next -generation sequencing and novel variants \nverified by Sanger sequencing. Large deletions or rearrangements were not evaluated. Nineteen \ndistinct pathogenic variants were identified, including 6 not previ ously described in 26 (1.3%) \ncases and in 4 (0.2%) controls with an odds for breast cancer of 6.58 (95% CI, 2.3 to 18.9). \nMoreover, 54 missense variants identified were slightly more common in cases (OR, 1.15; 95% \nCI, 1.02 to 1.32).  \n \nCybulski et al (2015) examined 2 loss -of-function  PALB2  variants (c.509_510delGA, \nc.172_175delTTGT) in women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 1996 and 2012 in \nPoland.20, From 12,529 genotyped women, a  PALB2  variant was identified in 116 (0.93%) cases \n(95% CI, 0.76% to 1.09%) versus 10 (0.21%; 95% CI, 0.08% to 0.34%) of 4702 controls (OR, \n4.39; 95% CI, 2.30 to 8.37). A  BRCA1  variant was identified in 3.47% of women with breast \ncancer and in 0.47% of controls (OR, 7.65; 95% CI, 4.98 to 11.75). Au thors estimated that \na PALB2  sequence variant conferred a 24% cumulative risk of breast cancer by age 75 years (in \nthe setting of age -adjusted breast cancer rates slightly more than half that in the U.K.76, or the \nU.S.77,). A PALB2  variant was also associated with poorer prognosis: 10 -year survival of 48.0% \nversus 74.7% when the variant was absent (HR adjusted for prognostic factors, 2.27; 95% CI, \n1.64 to 3.15).  \n \nCatucci et al (2014) performed population -based case -control studies in Italy (Milan or Bergamo) \namong women at risk for hereditary breast cancer and no  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variant.18, In Milan, 9 \ndifferent pathogenic  PALB2  variants were detected in 12 of 575 cases and none in 784 controls \n(blood donor); in Bergamo,  PALB2  c.1027C>T variants were detected in 6 of 113 cases and in 2 \nof 477 controls (OR, 13.4; 95% CI, 2.7 to 67.4). Performed in 2 distinct populations, the \ncombined sample size was small, and uncerta inty existed as indicated by the large effect \nestimate.  \n \nCasadei et al (2011) studied 959 U.S. women (non -Ashkenazi Jewish descent) with a family \nhistory of  BRCA1 - or BRCA2 -negative breast cancer and 83 female relatives using a family -based \ncase-control design.19, Using conventional sequencing, pathogenic  PALB2  variants were detected \nin 31 (3.2%) women with breast cancer and none in controls. Compared with their female \nrelatives without  PALB2  variants, the risk of breast cancer increased 2.3 -fold (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.2) \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 21 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

Mean age at diagnosis was \nnot associated with the presence of a variant (50.0 years with vs. 50.2 years without). Casadei et \nal (2011) provided few details of th eir analyses. Additionally, participants reported over 30 \nancestries and, given intermarriage in the U.S. population, stratification may have had an impact \non results. Generalizability of the risk estimate is therefore unclear.  \n \nHeikkinen et al (2009) conducted a population -based case -control study at a Finnish university \nhospital employing 2 case groups (947 familial and 1274 sporadic breast cancers) and 1079 \ncontrols.68, The study sample was obtained from 542 patients with familial breast cancer, a series \nof 884 oncology patients (79% of consecutive new cases), and 986 surgical patients (87% of \nconsecutive new cases); 1706 were genotyped for the  PALB2  c.1592delT variant. All familial \ncases were  BRCA1 - and BRCA2 -negative, but amon g controls, there were 183  BRCA  carriers.  \nPALB2   variant prevalence varied with family history: 2.6% when 3 or more family members were \naffected and 0.7% in all breast cancer patients. Variant prevalence was 0.2% among controls. In \nwomen with hereditary disease, a  PALB2  c.1592delT variant was associated with an increased \nrisk of breast cancer (OR, 11.0; 95% CI, 2.65 to 97.78), and was higher in women with the \nstrongest family histories (women with sporadic cancers; OR, 4.19; 95% CI, 1.52 to 12.09). \nAlthough  data were limited, survival was lower among  PALB2 -associated cases (10 -year survival, \n66.5%; 95% CI, 44.0% to 89.0% vs. 84.2%; 95% CI, 83.1% to 87.1% in women without a \nvariant; p=.041; HR, 2.94; p=.047). A  PALB2  variant was also associated with triple -negative \ntumors: 54.5% versus 12.2% with familial disease and 9.4% in sporadic cancers.  \n \nMultinational Samples  \nYang et al (2020) performed a complex segregation analysis to estimate relative and absolute \nrisks of breast cancer from data on 524 families with  PALB2  pathogenic variants from 21 \ncountries, the most frequent being c.3113G>A.74, Female breast cancer  (RR was 7.18 (95% CI, \n5.82 to 8.85; p=6.5x10-75) when assumed to be constant with age. The age -trend model \nprovided the best fit (p=2x10-3) and demonstrated a pattern of decreasing RR with each \nincreased decade in age. The RR was 4.69 (95% CI, 3.28 to 6.70) in those 75 years of age per \nthe age -trend model.  \n \nSouthey et al (2016) examined the association of 3  PALB2  variants (2 protein -truncating: \nc.1592delT and c.3113G>A; 1 missense c.2816T>G) with breast, prostate, and ovarian \ncancers.71, The association with breast cancer was examined among participants in the Breast \nCancer Association Consortium (BCAC; 42,671 cases and 42,164 controls). The BCAC (part of the \nlarger Collaborative Oncological Gene -environment Study) included 48 separate st udies with \nparticipants of multiple ethnicities, but mainly European, Asi an, and African American. Most \nstudies were population - or hospital -based case -controls with some oversampling cases with \nfamily histories or bilateral disease. A custom array was used for genotyping at 4 centers, with \n2% duplicate samples. The ORs were es timated adjusting for study among all participants, and \nexcluding those studies selecting patients based on family history or bilateral disease (37,039 \ncases, 38,260 controls). The c.1592delT variant was identified in 35 cases and 6 controls (from 4 \nstudie s in the U.K., Australia, U.S., Canada; OR, 4.52; 95% CI, 1.90 to 10.8; p<.001); in those \nwith no family history or bilateral disease (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.39 to 8.52; p=.003). The \nc3113G>A variant was identified in 44 cases and 8 controls (9 studies from F inland and Sweden; \nOR, 5.93; 95% CI, 2.77 to 12.7; p<.001) and in those with no family history or bilateral disease \n(OR, 4.21; 95% CI, 1.84 to 9.60; p<.001). There was no association between the c2816T>G \nmissense variant and breast cancer (found in 150 cas es and 145 controls).

The magnitude of the estimated RR approaches \nthat of a high penetrance gene but is accompanied by wide CIs owing to  the study design and \nlow carrier prevalence. The lower estimates obtained following exclusion of those selected based \non family history or bilateral disease are consistent with the importance of carefully considering \nthe risk of hereditary disease prior t o genetic testing.  \n \nAntoniou et al (2014) analyzed data from 362 members of 154 families with deleterious  PALB2  \nvariants.17, Individuals with benign variants or variants of uncertain significance were excluded. \nFamilies were recruited at 14 centers in 8 countries (U.S., U.K., Finland, Greece, Australia, \nCanada, Belgium, Italy) and had at least 1 member with a  BRCA1 - or BRCA2 -negative  PALB2 -\npositive breast cancer. There were 311 women with  PALB2  variants: 229 had breast cancer; 51 \nmen also had  PALB2  variants (7 had breast cance r). Of the 48 pathogenic (loss -of-function) \nvariants identified, 2 were most common (c.1592delT in 44 families, c.3113G>A in 25 families); \n39 of the 48 pathogenic variants were found in just 1 or 2 families. Carriers of  PALB2  variants \n(men and women) had a 9.47 -fold increased risk for breast cancer (95% CI, 7.16 to 12.57) \ncompared with the U.K. population under a single -gene model and age -constant RR; 30% of \ntumors were triple -negative. For a woman aged 50 to 54 years, the est imated RR was 6.55 (95% \nCI, 4.6 0 to 9.18). The RR of breast cancer for males with  PALB2  variants, compared with the \nmale breast cancer incidence in the general population, was 8.3 (95% CI, 0.77 to 88.5; p=.08). \nThe cumulative risk at age 50 years of breast cancer for female  PALB2  carriers without \nconsidering family history was 14% (95% CI, 9% to 20%); by age 70 years, it was 35% (95% \nCI, 26% to 46%). A family history of breast cancer increased the cumulative risk. If a woman \nwith a  PALB2  variant has a sister and mother who had breast can cer at age 50 years, by age 50 \nyears she would have a 27% (95% CI, 21% to 33%) estimated risk of developing breast cancer; \nand by age 70 years, a 58% (95% CI, 50% to 66%) risk. These results emphasize that family \nhistory affects penetrance.

The net health outcome can be improved if patients receive correct \ntherapy, more effective therapy, or avoid unnecessary therapy or testing.  \n \nDirect Evidence  \nDirect evidence of clinical utility is provided by studies that have compared health outcomes for \npatients managed with and without the test. Because these are intervention studies, the \npreferred evidence would be from RCTs.  \n \nEvidence of clinical utility limited to women with  PALB2  variants was not identified.  \n \nChain of Evidence  \nIndirect evidence on clinical utility rests on clinical validity. If the evidence is insufficient to \ndemonstrate test performance, no inferences can be made about clinical utility.  \n \nRosenthal et al (2017) reported an analysis of the impact of testing for genes other \nthan BRCA1/2  and by calculating whether carriers of these gene variants would have been \nidentified as candidates for enhanced screening based on family history alone.78, The database \nincluded 194,107 women who were tested using a hereditary cancer panel between 2013 and \n2016. The women were referred by their health care providers for clinical suspicion of hereditary \ncancer. It is unclear what proportion of the women met p rofessional society criteria for genetic \ntesting for breast cancer risk; baseline information regarding family history was not reported. Of \nthe women in the database, 893 had  PALB2  variants and were eligible for Claus assessment to \nestimate the risk of breast cancer. Approximately 27% of women with  PALB2  variants would have \nhad an estimated risk of breast cancer of 20% or higher based on the Claus model. The report \ndid not include health outcomes and it is unclear whether enhanced screening in women who \nhad a  moderate penetrance variant but did not have an estimated risk of breast cancer of 20% \nor greater based on the Claus model would have improved health outcomes from enhanced \nsurveillance.  \n \nStudies of women at high -risk based on family history alone or in those \nwith BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants are relevant to the clinical utility of  PALB2  testing given the \npenetrance estimates for  PALB2  and related molecular mechanism (\"BRCA -ness\"). Interventions \nto decrease breast cancer risk in asymptomatic high -risk women include screening79, (e.g., \nstarting at an early age, the addition of magnetic resonance imaging to mammography, and \nscreening annually), chemoprevention,80, and prophylactic mastectomy.81, In women with breast \ncancer, contralateral prophylactic mastectomy is of interest; other treatment decisions are \ndictated by clinical, pathologic, and other prognostic factors.  \n \nIn women at high -risk of hereditary breast cancer, including  BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers, evidence \nsupports a reduction in subsequent breast cancer after bilateral or contralateral prophylactic \nmastectomy. Decision analyses have also concluded the impact on breast cancer incidence \nextends life in high, but not average risk,82, women. For example, Schrag et al (1997, 2000) \nmodeled the impact of preventive interventions in women with  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants and \nexamined penetrance magnitudes similar to those est imated for a  PALB2  variant.83,84, Compared \nwith surveillance, a 30 -year-old BRCA  carrier with an expected 40% risk of breast cancer and 5% \nrisk of ovarian cancer by age 70 years would gain an expected 2.9 years following a prophylactic \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 30 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

While estimates of the magnitude of the association between  PALB2  and breast cancer \nrisk varied across studies, their magnitudes are of moderate to high penetrance.  \n \nOf interest is how variant detection affects penetrance estimates compared with family history \nalone. As with  BRCA  variants, model -based estimates allow estimating risks for individual patient \nand family characteristics. To illustrate using the Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease \nIncidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm model, a woman age 30 years whose mother ha d \nbreast cancer at age 35 years has an estimated 14.4% risk of breast cancer at age 70 years. If \nshe carries a  PALB2  variant, the risk increases to 51.1%. A woman, age 50 years, w ith breast \ncancer whose mother had breast cancer at age 50 years, has an estimated 11.7% risk of \ncontralateral cancer by age 70 years, increasing to 28.7% if she carries a  PALB2  variant.  \n \nEvidence concerning preventive interventions in women with  PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on \nstudies of high -risk women and  BRCA  carriers. In women at high -risk of hereditary breast cancer \nwho would consider preventive interventions, identifying a  PALB2  variant provides a more \naccurate estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can \noffer a better understanding of benefits and potential harms of interventions.  \n \nSupplemental Information  \nThe purpose of the following information is to provide reference material.

Priority will be given \nto guidelines that are informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and \ninclude a description of management of conflict of interest.  \n \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology  \nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline \ntesting in patients with breast cancer.85, The guideline recommends  BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for \nall patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over \nage 65 years (including those who are eligible for poly -ADP ribose polymerase [PARP] inhibitor \ntherapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be candidates for  BRCA1  and \nBRCA2  testing if it would help determine their p ersonal and family risk. Testing for other high -\npenetrance genes ( i.e., PALB2 , TP53, PTEN , STK11 , and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some \npatients.  \n \nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer. \nGenes with a strong testing recommendation are those that confer a higher cancer risk or are \nhighly actionable. For breast cancer, the more strongly recommended genes for testing and \ninclusion in multigene panels are:  BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK11 , and TP53. Of \nthese,  CDH1 , PTEN , STK11 , and TP53 are associated with specific syndromes and can be \nexcluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the \nsyndrome.86, For epithelial ovarian cancer, the more str ongly recommended genes \nare: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and RAD51D . \nTesting for  BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and \nprostate cancer, and testing for  PALB2  is strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. \nThe authors note that including  BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and Lynch syndrome genes \n(i.e., MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is \nreasonable due to their importance and prevalence.  \n \nNATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK  \n \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 32 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

Maternal and paternal sides of the family should be considered independently for \nfamilia l patterns of cancer. Testing of unaffected individuals should be considered \"when no \nappropriate affected family member is available for testing.”  \n \nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, \nspecifically  BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK11 , and TP53. Use of \"tailored panels that \nare disease -focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over \nlarge panels that include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".  \n \nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues \nto endorse a risk -stratified approach and does not endorse universal testing of all patients with \nbreast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specifici ty, shortages in trained \ngenetics health professionals to provide appropriate pre - and post -test genetic counseling, and \nlack of evidence to support risk management for genes included in many multi -gene panels.\"  \n \nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic \nvariant is identified through tumor profiling, then  BRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is \nrecommended.  \n \nAdditionally, the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines (v.2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing \nfor persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe in multiple algorithms that testing should \ninclude at least  BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability, tumor mutational \nburden, and neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology, \nOV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88, \n \nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors  \nCurrent NCCN guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma (v.2.2024) refers to the NCCN guidelines \non genetic/familial high -risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers detailed \nabove, and state: “The panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed \npancreatic cancer and in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for inherited susceptibility.\" \nThe pa nel recommends \"using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary cancer syndromes.\"89, \n \nThe NCCN guidelines for genetic and familial high -risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and \npancreatic cancers (v.3.2024)  includes  states  that germline testing is clinically indicated for \nindividuals with neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers per the NCCN guidelines on neuroendocrine \nand adrenal tumors.90, The NCCN guidelines for neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors (v.1.2024) \nstates, \"consider genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing: In a patient with \nduodenal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at any age\", noting , \"studies of unselected patients \nwith pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have identified germline variants in 16% -17% of cases. \nHowever, these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"  \n \n\nGermline Genetic Testing for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome  Page 33 of 56 \nand Other High -Risk Cancers  (BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2)  \n \nCurrent Procedural Terminology  © American Medical Association.

Furthermore, \npatients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from updated testing. Finally, genetic \ntesting should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when \nthey meet NCCN guideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance \nare not clinically actionable.  \n \nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology  \nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence -based consensus \nstatement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic cancer.93, The statement  includes  criteria \nfor recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may \nbe genetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer. Overall, the SGO and the NCCN \nrecommendations are very similar; the main differences are the exclusion of women  with breast \ncancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first -, second -, or third -degree \nrelatives with breast cancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer \nwho have a first -, second -, or third -degree male relative  with breast cancer; and men with a \npersonal history of breast cancer. Additionally, SGO  recommended recommends  genetic \nassessment for unaffected women who have a male relative with breast cancer. Moreover, SGO \nindicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment \n(e.g., few female relatives, hysterectomy, or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family \nmembers, or adoption in the lineage).  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  \nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaffirmed 2021) published a \nPractice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.94, The following \nrecommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): “Genetic testing \nis recommended when the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of \ngenetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited  cancer syndrome for which specific \ngenes have been identified and when the results of testing  are likely to influence medical \nmanagement.”  \n \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force  \nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic \ntesting of  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women state:  \n \n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family \nhistory of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated \nwith BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool.

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

Rapid genome sequencing (81425, 81426, 0094U) is considered investigational  for all \nother indications. \nback to top  \n \nNOTES AND DEFINITIONS  \nExome Sequencing (ES)  is a genomic technique for sequencing all of the protein-coding regions \nof genes in the genome (also known as the exome). \nGenom\ne Sequencing (GS)  is a genomic technique for sequencing the complete DNA sequence, \nwhich includes protein coding as well as non- codin g DNA elements.  \nTrio \nTesting  includes testing of the child and both biological/genetic parents and increases the \nchances of finding a definitive diagnosis, while reducing false- positi ve findings.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  10 \n \nComparator Exome Sequencing is used only for comparison with the proband (individual \nundergoing exome sequencing) and is used to inform the pathogenicity of variants. A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022).

The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available. They suggest that there should be predicted impact on health outcomes, including immediate impact on medical manag ement based on the \nmolecular results.

Policy Description  \n \nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is the strategy of using next -generation technology to sequence the \nentire genome. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) refers to sequencing of the exome, the component of \nthe genome that predominantly encode proteins. Next generation  sequencing (NGS) involves \nsequencing of multiple small fragments of DNA in parallel, producing fast, accurate sequencing results \n(Hulick, 2024).  \n \nThis policy is applicable for undiagnosed rare germline disorders.  \n \nII. Indications and/or Limitations of Coverage  \n \nApplication of coverage criteria is dependent upon an individual’s benefit coverage at the time of the \nrequest. Specifications pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid can be found in the “Applicable State and \nFederal Regulations” section of this policy documen t. \n \n1) For the evaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in individuals less \nthan 18 years of age , whole exome sequencing (WES) and comparator analysis (e.g., \nparents/siblings) WES MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA when all of the following criteria are met:  \n \na) When the individual has been evaluated by an ABMGG  board -certified medical geneticist or an \nABGC board -certified genetic counselor (CGC)  and has been counseled about the potential risks \nof genetic testing;  \nb) When the WES results will impact patient management and clinical outcome for the individual \nbeing tested;  \nc) When a genomic  etiology is the most likely explanation for the phenotype;  \nd) When no other causative circumstances (e.g., environmental exposures, injury, infection) can \nexplain the symptoms;  \ne) When the clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single -gene or \ntargeted panel testing (e.g., comparative genomic hybridization/chromosomal microarray \nanalysis) is available;  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 2 of 25 \n \nf) When the differential diagnosis list and/or phenotype warrant testing of multiple genes and \none of the following:  \n \ni) WES is more practical than the separate single gene tests or panels that would be \nrecommended based on the differential diagnosis.  \nii) WES results may preclude the need for multiple and/or invasive procedures, follow -up, or \nscreening that would be recommended in the absence of testing.  \n \n2) For a fetus with ultrasound anomalies, WES and comparator analysis (e.g., parents/siblings) WES \nMEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA  when all of the following criteria are met:  \n \na) When pre -test counseling has been provided by an ABMGG  board -certified medical geneticist \nor an ABGC board -certified genetic counselor (CGC) ; \nb) When standard chromosomal microarray testing (CMA) and karyotype analysis have failed to \nyield a definitive diagnosis;  \nc) When a genomic  etiology is the most likely explanation for the phenotype;  \nd) When no other causative circumstances (e.g., environmental exposures, injury, infection) can \nexplain the symptoms;  \ne) When clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single -gene or \ntargeted panel testing is available. If a specific diagnosis is suspected, molecular testing for the \nsuggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) should be the initial test.  \n \n3) Reanalysis of exome sequencing (ES) data with WES and comparator analysis (e.g., parents/siblings) \nWES MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA  for any of the following situations : \n \na) For individuals less than 18 years of age  with initial negative ES results as an aid in clinical \ndiagnosis when additional phenotypic findings are noted during a child’s growth and \ndevelopment.  \nb) For diagnostic results and results deemed to be possibly (but not definitively) associated with \nthe fetal phenotype (new gene -disease associations might have been unknown at the time of \ninitial diagnosis).  \nc) For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, if a new phenotype develops in the proband \nafter birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant amount of time has passed (at least \n12 months) since the initial testing was performed.  \nd) If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time . \n \n4) When WES is unable to identify a causative mutation and the clinical suspicion of a genomic etiology \nremains in situations where any of the above criteria are met in their entirety, whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA.  \n \nThe following does not meet coverage criteria due to a lack of available published scientific literature \nconfirming that the test(s) is/are required and beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment of an \nindividual’s illness.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 3 of 25 \n \n \n5) If WES has been previously performed, further genetic tests involving only exome analyses DO NOT \nMEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \n6) Focused exome sequencing and targeted WGS DO NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA.  \n7) For all other situations not described above, WES DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \n8) Combination testing of WES with intronic variants testing, regulatory variants testing, and/or \nmitochondrial genome testing, sometimes referred to as whole exome plus testing (e.g., Genomic \nUnity ® Exome Plus Analysis), DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA .  \n9) For all other situations  not described above, WGS  DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \nIII.

Scientific Background   \nDNA sequencing is a critical tool for the evaluation of many medical conditions. The two primary \nmethods of DNA sequencing in the clinical setting are Sanger sequencing and next -generation \nsequencing or NGS. NGS is a technique that allows for the rapid seq uencing of multiple strands of DNA. \nIt is not limited to one specific type of test; rather it encompasses numerous technologies that produce \nswift and high -volume sequencing. NGS can be used to sequence larger sequences, such as the exome \nor the entire gen ome. This is opposed to the traditional Sanger sequencing, which is more useful for \nsequencing a specific gene (Hulick, 2024) . \nThe NGS procedure typically includes the following steps: first the patient’s DNA is prepared to serve as \na template, then DNA fragments are isolated (on solid surfaces such as small beads) where sequence \ndata is generated. Then these results are compared against a reference genome. Any DNA sample may \nbe used if the quality and quantity of that sample is sufficient, but the methods of library generation and \ndata analysis often vary from panel to panel. Evaluating the results of a gene panel typically requir es \nexpertise in bioinformatics. Since NGS reports data on any variants found, great care must be taken to \nevaluate these gene variants, especially variants of unknown significance (VUS) and secondary findings \n(Hulick, 2024; Rehm et al., 2013) .  \nExome and genome sequencing are usually performed with NGS. The exome represents all the protein -\nencoding genes, and at least 85% of pathogenic mutations are found in the exome. Further, the exome \nonly comprises approximately 1.5% -2% of the genome, thereby  making it more cost effective to \nsequence than whole genome sequencing. The entire exome includes approximately 30 megabases \ncompared to the genome’s 3.3 gigabases. However, sequencing an entire genome may be useful as a \npathogenic mutation may be in a no ncoding region of the genome, such as gene regulation dysfunction. \nMost clinical NGS testing uses targeted panels or whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) is only used in select cases. For instance, conditions such as nonsyndromic  hearing \nloss (possible pathogenic variants in over 60 genes) may benefit from WES evaluation (Hulick, 2024) .  \nSeveral companies have pivoted towards focused exome sequencing. These are panels tailored to \nindividual phenotypes and target a maximum number of genes depending on the company. There is a \n>30% diagnostic yield, with freedom for clinicians to choose speci fic genes they are interested in, with \nreduced cost and options to reflex to WES for negative cases (GGC, 2022) . In their study, Jia et al. (2023)  \nretrospectively analyzed 372 pediatric patients who were referred to clinically focused exome \nsequencing (CFES), and concluded that CFES may be first -line for “diagnosing young children with \nsuspected genetic conditions, as it validates the identification  of molecular genetics alterations and \nfacilitates comprehensive medical management. The patients that were more likely to receive diagnoses \nvia CFES were those with “metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities, craniofacial /otolaryngology/ \nophthalmologic abnorm alities, and/or [abnormalities of] the integument” (Jia et al., 2023) . Despite the \nnovelty and expected benefits of focused exome sequencing, more clinical studies with larger sample \nsizes are necessary.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 8 of 25 \n \nProprietary Testing  \nMany proprietary technologies for WES and WGS are available. Companies such as Variantyx provide \nhighly specialized genetic testing to patients and clinicians. The Genomic Unity® Exome Plus Analysis test \nsequences the exome, including intronic and regulato ry variants, identifies disease causing deletions or \nduplications in the genome, and analyzes the mitochondrial genome with heteroplasmy (≥5%). This test \nmay identify many genes for a variety of disorders including AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, \nATXN8OS, ATXN10, C9ORF72, CACNA1A, CNBP, CSTB, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, JPH3, NOP56, \nNOTCH2NLC, PABPN1, PPP2R2B, TBP  (for adult -onset movement disorders), AFF2, DIP2B, FMR1  (for \nearly -onset intellectual disability disorders), and PHOX2B, TCF4  (for other disorders) (variantyx, 2020) . \nThis test requires either a blood, saliva or gDNA (genomic DNA) sample and has an eight -week \nturnaround time.  \nClinical Utility and Validity  \nAlfares et al. (2018)  compared the cost -effectiveness and clinical utility of both WES and WGS. Data was \nanalyzed from 108 participants; all 108 individuals had negative array comparative genomic \nhybridization (also known as chromosomal microarray) results and negative or inco nclusive WES results \nbefore WGS was performed. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is another common genetic testing \nmethod that can analyze many pieces of DNA simultaneously. The authors only pinpointed three positive \ncases where WGS identified a genetic or inhe rited disorder that WES did not recognize; further, it was \nnoted that “30% of the positive cases identified by WGS could be identified by reanalyzing the WES raw \ndata, and WGS achieved an only 7% higher detection rate. Therefore, until the cost of WGS appr oximates \nthat of WES, reanalyzing WES raw data is recommended before performing WGS” (Alfares et al., 2018) . \nYang et al. (2014)  conducted a single -center observational study of 2000 patients with clinical whole \nexome sequencing performed for a suspected genetic disorder. A molecular diagnosis was reported for \n504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously  reported. The investigators \nconcluded that “the yield of whole -exome sequencing may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients” (Yang et al., 2014) . Best et al. (2018)  reviewed 31 different \nWES studies and noted that the diagnostic rates varied between 6.2% and 80%; however, the \nresearchers state that the “differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to \nsequencing largely account for the wide r ange of diagnostic rates.”  \nTammimies et al. (2015)  evaluated the molecular diagnostic yield of CMA and WES in children with \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD). The patient cohort included 258 consecutively enrolled unrelated \nchildren with ASD, stratified into three groups based on the presence of major congen ital abnormalities \nand minor physical anomalies. All probands underwent CMA, with WES performed for 95 proband -\nparent trios. The molecular diagnostic yields of CMA and WES were comparable. Among the 95 patients \nundergoing WES, eight  children (8.4%)  received an ASD -related molecular diagnosis. Among the children \nwho underwent both CMA and WES testing, the estimated proportion with an identifiable genetic \netiology was 15.8%. The investigators concluded that “if replicated in additional  populations, these \nfindings may inform appropriate selection of molecular diagnostic testing for children affected by ASD” \n(Tammimies et al., 2015) . A similar study was performed by Arteche -López et al. (2021)  to validate WES \nas a “first -tier test for the genetic diagnosis of [ASD], when there is no suspicion of fragile X syndrome.” \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 9 of 25 \n \nUpon comparing the clinical utility of CMA, FMR1  testing, and WES testing, the researchers “achieved a \nglobal diagnostic rate of 12.8% (44/343), the majority of them being characterised by WES (33/44; 75%) \ncompared to CMA (9/44; 20.4%) or  FMR1  testing (2/44; 4.5%),” evidently demonstrating the “higher \ndiagnostic power” of WES compared to CMA (Arteche -López et al., 2021) . \nTaylor et al. (2015)  performed whole genome sequencing in 217 individuals across a broad spectrum of \ngenetic disorders in whom previous screening had identified no pathogenic variants. Disease -causing \nvariants were identified in 21% of cases, with the proportion increasing to  34% (23/68) for mendelian \ndisorders and 57% (8/14) in family trios. The investigators concluded that the results “demonstrate the \nvalue of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding \nchallenges” (Taylor et al., 2015) . \nMiller et al. (2017)  performed exome/whole genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause in patients \nwith craniosynostosis, in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative. Out of the 40 \npatients’ tests, associated mutations were identified in 15 patients (37.5%) involving 14 different genes. \nIn five of the 15 positive cases, the molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences in \npatient management. The investigators concluded that “the benefits of exome/whole genome \nsequencing to identify causal  mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has \nyielded negative results” (Miller et al., 2017) . \nCrowley et al. (2020)  used WES in a single -center cohort study of 1005 pediatric IBD patients and found \na 3% prevalence of damaging variants in genes linked to monogenic IBD, and that 1% of monogenic \npediatric IBD patients have variants in genes associated with primary immunod eficiency that are \npotentially curable through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As rare genetic variants \ncould manifest in different phenotypes, the researchers believe that the “data supports the diagnosis of \nmonogenic disease beyond th e very early onset IBD population especially in children with a family \nhistory of autoimmune diseases and those with evidence of extra -intestinal manifestations of IBD” and \nthat WES will lend itself to provide definitive and personalized treatments in the future (Crowley et al., \n2020) . \nSrivastava et al. (2014)  conducted a retrospective cohort study on 78 children with neurodevelopmental \ndisabilities and a prior unrevealing workup before WES. The overall presumptive diagnostic testing rate \nwas 41% (32/78 patients). Results of WES affected patient management in a ll cases, most often related \nto reproductive planning (27/78). The investigators concluded that the high diagnostic yield of WES \ncould lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning \n(Srivastava et al., 2014) . \nHaskell et al. (2018)  studied the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in the evaluation of \nneuromuscular disorders. A total of 93 undiagnosed patients with potential neuromuscular disorders \nparticipated in this study; the diagnostic yield of these 93 patients with exome seq uencing was 12.9% \n“with one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in a causative gene associated with \nthe patient's disorder” (Haskell et al., 2018) . In this study, exome sequencing was able to provide or \nclarify a neuromuscular disorder diagnosis, but only in a small percentage of the population studied.  \nInvolving WGS or WES as a supplemental level of evaluation has been able to effect change in medical \ncare and treatment pathways. In the NIH -funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, among 382 patients \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 10 of 25 \n \nwith complete evaluations, “28 (21%) of the patients who received a diagnosis, the diagnosis led to a \nrecommendation regarding a change in therapy. In 49 (37%), the diagnosis led to a change in care other \nthan therapy, such as the narrowing of diagnostic t esting. In 48 (36%), the diagnosis led to variant -\nspecific genetic counseling but did not lead to a change in the diagnostic or therapeutic strategy.” The \nchanges in therapy ranged from known drugs, vitamins, coenzyme supplementations, and transplant in \none patient. This demonstrated evidence supporting usage of DNA sequencing for genetically \ndetermined conditions and a representative lens of how it can affect medical care (Splinter et al., 2018) . \nMuthaffar (2021)  conducted a retrospective chart review for WES results between January 2018 to \nNovember 2019 for patients at a pediatric neurology clinic in Saudi Arabia to identify the utility of WES. \nIt was found that “twenty -six children with undiagnosed neurological conditions were identified and \nunderwent WES diagnosis. Nineteen patients (73.0%) of the cohort were diagnosed with pathogenic \nvariants, likely pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS).” The researcher also \nfurthered the conclusions of  the WES high diagnostic rate by proving direct implications on clinical \nmanagement based on testing results. One patient who had a positive pathogenic BTD mutation, \ndiagnosed at seven -years old with a biotinidase deficiency, was started on biotin supplements after WES \ntesting, and was able to breathe independently off a ventilator, regain motor capabilities with physical \ntherapy, improve hearing, and elimin ate convulsions (Muthaffar, 2021) . \nUsing WES on eleven probands from ten Jordanian families who have been formerly diagnosed with \nlimb -girdle dystrophy (LGMD) and Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT), Ababneh et al. (2021)  identified \na series of missense, nonsense, and deletion variants associated with neuromuscular disorders. \nConsequently, the researchers argue that “Utilization of WES is helpful to facilitate rapid and accurate \nNMDs diagnosis, complementing a thorough cli nical evaluation”, especially in a country where the risk \nof autosomal -recessive disorders is increased by consanguinity and the implementation of genetic \ndiagnosis is limited and the results misunderstood (Ababneh et al., 2021) .  \nSanford et al. (2019)  investigated the clinical utility of rWGS in children within the pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU). They were able to make a molecular diagnosis by rWGS in 17 of 38 children, and in four \nof the 17 children diagnosed by rWGS (24%), “the genetic diagnose s led to a change in management \nwhile in the PICU, including genome -informed changes in pharmacotherapy and transition to palliative \ncare… Eighty -two percent of diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient and/or family \nafter PICU discharge, i ncluding avoidance of biopsy, administration of factor replacement, and \nsurveillance for disorder -related sequelae” (Sanford et al., 2019) . In this retrospective analysis, benefits \nof rWGS were further elucidated in the setting of unknown or unclear clinical etiologies.  \nReda et al. (2020)  studied WES for metastatic solid cancer diagnoses in 506 patients. In this study, the \nsomatic and germline exome analysis was restricted to 317 specific genes. Exome sequencing was \nsuccessful in 386 tumor samples, and 342 patients received a therapeutic p roposal based on their \ngenetic results. However, only 79 patients were treated with an NGS matched therapy. While this study \nshows that WES is a possible tool to assist with metastatic solid cancer diagnoses and treatments, “no \ndifferences were observed be tween PFS [progression -free survival] ratios of patients treated with \nmatched therapy versus standard therapy” (Reda et al., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 11 of 25 \n \nOther studies have also yielded bifurcating results on the periodic revisiting of unsolved exome cases \nand for variants of unknown significance.

(2019)  found that re -analysis of 101 WES cases \none to seven  years after initial analysis resulted in “the identification of additional diagnostic variants in \n3 rare disease cases (5.9%) and 1 sudden unexplained death case (2%), which increased our molecular \ndiagnostic yield to 31.4% and 12%, respectively.” However,  though they recognize the importance of \nany diagnostic yield to those families potentially affected, the authors also acknowledge that “most of \nour cases remain unexplained after our re -analysis”, which they attribute to an enduring lack of coverage \nof functional exonic variants, along with “the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease that is not \neasily dissected in small families, and the possibility of disease due to epigenetic, somatic, or other \nuninterrogated genomic aberrations.” As such, “We [ the authors] suggest that a 6 -month cycle of \nautomated re -analysis could improve the pace at which new findings are disseminated to patients. \nPeriodic re -analysis by third party or other software not originally used to analyze cases is also \npotentially use ful to uncover pathogenic variants that may be missed by the differences across genome \ninterpretation platforms” (Salfati et al., 2019) .  \nParent -child Trio Testing  \nParent -child trio testing is a strategy which helps to identify single pathogenic mutations among the \nmany genomic variants in an individual. Specifically, the sequencing of both the parents and the patient \nallows for the variant to be identified easier an d “filtered based on consistency or inconsistency \naccording to the laws of Mendelian inheritance” (Sakai et al., 2013) . \nLee et al. (2014)  reported on the initial clinical indications for clinical exome sequencing (CES) referrals \nand molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and different test types. CES was performed on \n814 patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions who underwent WES. CES was conducted \nusing a trio -CES technique which involves  both parents and their affected child sequenced \nsimultaneously. Overall, a molecular diagnosis with a causative variant in a well -established clinical gene \nwas provided for 213/ 814 (26%) cases. The trio -CES was associated with a higher molecular diagnostic \nyield (31%; 127/410 cases) than proband -CES or traditional molecular diagnostic methods. The \ninvestigators concluded that “additional studies designed to validate these finding s and to explore the \neffect of this approach on clinical and economic outcomes are warranted” (Lee et al., 2014) . \nSoden et al. (2014)  performed diagnostic WGS and/or WES in parent -child trios for 100 families with 119 \nchildren with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A total of 45% of the families received molecular \ndiagnoses of an established genetic disorder (53/119 affected children) . An accelerated sequencing \nmodality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families with acutely ill children (11/15). In this study, \nWES proved to be less costly than continued conventional diagnostic testing of children with NDD in \nwhom initial testing  failed to yield a diagnosis. The investigators concluded that “initial diagnostic \nevaluation of children with NDD should include trio WGS or WES, with extension of accelerated \nsequencing modalities to high -acuity patients” (Soden et al., 2014) . \nAnother study compared fetal WES versus trio analysis WES on fetuses with sonographic abnormalities. \nThe researchers found that trio analysis yielded a positive/definitive diagnosis in 30% (3/10) of the cases \nas compared to only 14.3% (2/14) of the singlet on cases. They conclude, “In order to expedite \ninterpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 12 of 25 \n \ncompromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes” (Drury et al., 2015) . Similarly, these data are \nsupported by another study of trio analysis of thirty different cases. A total of 10% of the cases were \npositive for a pathogenic finding, and 17% were de novo, inherited recessive, or X -linked variants. The \nauthors conclude, “T his study outlines the way for a substantial improvement in the diagnostic yield of \nprenatal genetic abnormalities through the application of next -generation sequencing” (Carss et al., \n2014) . \nYates et al. (2017)  performed WES, including trio analysis, using samples obtained from deceased fetuses \nwith ultrasound anomalies. They note that 20% of cases were positive overall with a definitive diagnosis \nwith another 45% positive for possible pathogenic candidate varia nts. Comparing trio analysis to \nsingleton analysis, 24% (n=11) of trio analysis resulted in a definitive diagnostic finding versus 14% (n=3) \nfor singleton testing (Yates et al., 2017) .  \nClark et al. (2018)  compared the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and CMA in children with \nsuspected genetic disorders. Trio analyses were also analyzed. Many studies were reviewed in this meta -\nanalysis; the authors state that “In 37 studies, comprising 20,068 chi ldren, diagnostic utility of WGS \n(0.41, 95% CI 0.34 -0.48, I2 = 44%) and WES (0.36, 95% CI 0.33 -0.40, I2 = 83%) were qualitatively greater \nthan CMA (0.10, 95% CI 0.08 -0.12, I2 = 81%) (Clark et al., 2018) . Further, a statistical difference was not \nfound regarding the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS. Finally, “Subgroups with higher WGS/WES \ndiagnostic utility were trios and those receiving hospital -based interpretation. WGS/WES should be \nconsidered a first -line genomic test for children with suspected genetic diseases” (Clark et al., 2018) . \nZhang et al. (2021)  performed WES and trio analysis on 18 unrelated men who have idiopathic \nhypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), which is a rare genetic disorder that causes delayed or absent \npuberty as well as infertility due to gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) insuffi ciency/deficiency, \nand their parents. With this testing, “one reported and 10 novel variants in eight known IHH causative \ngenes ( AXL, CCDC141, CHD7, DMXL2, FGFR1, PNPLA6, POLR3A, and PROKR2 ), nine variants in nine \nrecently reported candidate genes ( DCAF17,  DCC, EGF, IGSF10, NOTCH1, PDE3A, RELN, SLIT2, and \nTRAPPC9 ), and four variants in four novel candidate genes for IHH ( CCDC88C, CDON, GADL1,  and \nSPRED3 ) were identified in 77.8% (14/18) of IHH cases.” This analysis also supported oligogenic etiology \nfor disease presentation, with 44.4% cases carrying at least two variants in IHH -related genes. They also \nfound that the variants “tended to be maternally in herited (maternal with n = 17 vs paternal with n = 7; \nP = 0.028),” which was confirmed by their previous l iterature review, and due to the presence of female \ncarriers, extends the notion that females may be more tolerant of “deleterious” IHH -related gene \nmutations. This study exemplifies the clinical utility of WES and trio analysis for reproductive genetic \ndisorders and could be used to continue pedigree analyses for IHH (Zhang et al., 2021) . \nMalcher et al. (2022)  investigated the use of whole -genome sequencing in identifying new candidate \ngenes for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). The authors applied WGS for 39 patients with NOA to \nidentify novel NOA -associated SNVs, yielding “8 potentially disease causing [sic] variants in 4 genes, \nfollowed by 30 variants in 20 genes that were previously linked to infertility, and 20 variants in 13 genes \nthat have never been investigated with respect to male infertility but could be important in patients \nwith NOA” in 29 of the 3 9 azoospermic individuals. Of these 58 variants, 16 were newly discovered and, \nas such, “highly recommended to examine their possible function and mechanism of participation in \ngametogenesis” (Malcher et al., 2022) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 13 of 25 \n \nIn their examination of whole exome and genome sequencing in a Mendelian disorder cohort, Ewans et \nal. (2022)  determined that “WGS resulted in a diagnosis in one third (34%; 13/38 families) of \nundiagnosed families who had previously had WES.” However, when adjusting for “factors such as \nimprovements to gene -disease knowledge and genomic pipelines through contempo rary WES \nreanalysis, the WGS diagnostic yield reduced to 19% (6/31 remaining families)”, primarily due to “due \nto reduced WES coverage of critical regions that may be solved through an improved WES platform.” \nSuch results contribute to the debate about the  “trade -off between the lower cost of WES and the higher \ndiagnostic yield of WGS” and will ultimately be a function of “the clinical scenario and local resourcing \nand availability” (Ewans et al., 2022) . \nV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)  \nIn 2012, the ACMG released a policy statement outlining points to consider in the clinical application of \ngenomic sequencing to the detection of germ -line mutations. The ACMG recommended that WGS/WES \nshould be considered in the clinical diagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:  \n• “The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but the phenotype \ndoes not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic test targeting a specific gene is \navailable on a clinical basis.”  \n• “A patient presents with a defined genetic disorder that demonstrates a high degree of genetic \nheterogeneity, making WES or WGS analysis of multiple genes simultaneously a more practical \napproach.”  \n• “A patient presents with a likely genetic disorder, but specific genetic tests available for that \nphenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \n• “A fetus with a likely genetic disorder in which specific genetic tests, including targeted \nsequencing tests, available for that phenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \nACMG stated that “WGS/WES may be considered in preconception carrier screening, using a strategy to \nfocus on genetic variants known to be associated with significant phenotypes in homozygous or \nhemizygous progeny.” ACMG further stated that WGS and WES shou ld not be used at this time as an \napproach to prenatal screening or as a first -tier approach for newborn screening (ACMG, 2012) . \nACMG released a guideline on informed consent for genome/exome sequencing. In that guideline, they \nnoted that WGS/WES was not recommended “before the legal age of majority” unless for “phenotype -\ndriven clinical diagnostic uses or circumstances in which ear ly monitoring or interventions are available \nand effective” (ACMG, 2013) . \nIn 2014 the ACMG published guidelines (Alford et al., 2014)  for the clinical evaluation and etiologic \ndiagnosis of hearing loss which state: “Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's \ninformed consent, genetic testing, if available, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis —this testing \nmay include single -gene tests, hearing loss  sequencing  panels,  whole -exome  sequencing(WES),  whole -\ngenome  sequencing  (WGS), chromosome analysis, or microarray -based copy -number analysis, \ndepending on clinical findings.”  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 14 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG published guidelines on the use of fetal exome sequencing (ES) in prenatal diagnoses. \nThese guidelines are  below (Monaghan et al., 2020) : \nPretest Considerations  \n• “Exome sequencing may be considered for a fetus with ultrasound anomalies when standard CMA \nand karyotype analysis have failed to yield a definitive diagnosis. If a specific diagnosis is \nsuspected, molecular testing for the suggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) \nshould be the initial test. At the present time, there are no data supporting the clinical use for ES \nfor other reproductive indications, such as the identification of sonographic markers suggestive \nof aneuploidy or a history of re current unexplained pregnancy loss.  \n• Trio analysis consisting of the proband and both biological parents is preferred to singleton (fetus \nonly) or duo (fetus and one parent) analyses. Trio analysis consistently shows higher diagnostic \nyields compared with nontrio analysis. It allows for the i mmediate identification of de novo \nvariants, determination of phase for biallelic variants, and confirmation of carrier status in both \nparents when a homozygous variant is detected. For laboratories not requiring trio analysis for \nprenatal ES, all efforts should be made to determine inheritance of identified fetal variants with \ntargeted testing of the biological parents. There may be circumstances where both biological \nparents are unable to submit specimens. In this scenario, variant segregation testing usi ng the \navailable parent or testing of other closely related family members should be considered.  \n• Pretest counseling is ideally provided by a genetics  professional during which the types of variants \nthat may be returned in a laboratory report for all tested family members would be reviewed.  \nPosttest Considerations  \n• Post -test counseling is recommended, regardless of the test result. It should be provided by \nindividuals with relevant expertise, preferably a genetics professional.  \nReanalysis Considerations  \n• For patients with initial negative ES results, reanalysis of exome sequencing data aids clinical \ndiagnosis after 12 months. This outcome has been validated in the pediatric population as \nadditional phenotypic findings might be noted during a child’s growth  and development. \nContinuous updates in database resources and new publications may provide further information \nfor variant and gene classification.  \n• Due to the discovery of new gene –disease associations (that were unknown at the time of initial \nanalysis), reanalysis can also be considered for diagnostic results and results deemed to be \npossibly (but not definitively) associated with the fetal phenotype . \n• For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, reanalysis may be considered if a new \nphenotype develops in the proband after birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant \namount of time has passed (either at the discretion of the testing lab oratory or at least 12 months) \nsince the initial testing was performed.  \n• If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time, a reanalysis could be considered” (Monaghan et \nal., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 15 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG conducted a systematic evidence review to support guideline development for the \nuse of exome and genome sequencing among patients with congenital anomalies, developmental delay, \nor intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). From their review, the  ACMG concluded, “There is evidence that \nES/GS for patients with CA/ DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision -making, which could lead \nto improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate \nevidence regar ding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients \nwith CA/DD/ID” (Malinowski et al., 2020) . \nIn 2021 the ACMG asserted that as the body of literature surrounding this continues to burgeon, it urges \nthem to “strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second -tier test (guided by clinical judgment \nand often clinician –patient/family shared decisi on making after CMA or focused testing) for patients \nwith one or more CAs prior to one year of age or for patients with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage” (Manickam et al., 2021) .  \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal and Fetal \nMedicine (SFM)  \nIn 2016 the ACOG and SFM published a joint committee opinion on “ Microarrays and Next -Generation \nSequencing Technology: The Use of Advanced Genetic Diagnostic Tools in Obstetrics and Gynecology”, \nwhich states that “the routine use of whole -genome or whole -exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis \nis not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer reviewed data and \nvalidation studies are published” (ACOG & SFM, 2016) .  \nHowever, ACOG and SFM note that WES may be considered when “specific genetic tests available for a \nphenotype, including targeted sequencing tests, have failed to determine a diagnosis in a fetus with \nmultiple congenital anomalies suggestive of a genetic di sorder.” The guideline further clarifies that “in \nselect circumstances (recurrent or lethal fetal anomalies in which other approaches have been \nnoninformative), [WES] may be considered as a diagnostic tool, but only after other appropriate testing \nhas been  noninformative and after extensive counseling by an [OB -GYN[ or other health care provider \nwith genetics expertise who is familiar with these new technologies and their limitations” (ACOG & SFM, \n2016) . This committee opinion was reaffirmed in 2023.  \nJoint Position Statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD), the Society for \nMaternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF)  \nPer the guideline, the word “sequencing” is used to refer to “whole exome sequencing, targeted analysis \nusing clinical panels, and whole genome sequencing.”  \n“The use of diagnostic sequencing is currently being introduced for evaluation of fetuses for whom \nstandard diagnostic genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), has already been \nperformed and is uninformative or is offered concurrentl y according to accepted practice guidelines, or \nfor whom expert genetic opinion determines that standard genetic testing is less optimal than \nsequencing for the presenting fetal phenotype” (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nRoutine use of prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot be supported due to “insufficient” \nvalidation and data about benefits and pitfalls (ISPD et al., 2018) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 16 of 25 \n \nWithin the section on recommendations for all diagnostic applications of genome -wide sequencing, \nconcerning trio analysis, they state, “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio \nanalysis, where fetal and both parental samples are s equenced and analyzed together. The trio approach \ncurrently benefits timeliness of result interpretation and aids assignment of pathogenicity for detected \nsequence variants. If proband‐only sequencing is performed, validation of diagnostic or potentially \ndiagnostic findings best includes a determination of inheritance through targeted testing of samples \nfrom biological parents” (ISPD et al., 2018) . However, the guideline could not recommend one \nsequencing method over another, nor was the guideline certain on the best way to interpret variants \nfound in genome -wide sequencing.  \nThe guideline provides three scenarios in which fetal sequencing may be “beneficial”:  \n“A current pregnancy with a fetus with a single major anomaly or with multiple organ system anomalies \nthat are suggestive of a possible genetic etiology, but no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA; or in \nselect situations with no CMA result, following a multidisciplinary review and consensus, in which there \nis a fetus with a multiple anomaly ‘pattern’ that strongly suggests a single gene disorder.”  \n“A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with a major \nsingle anomaly or multiple anomalies suggestive of a genetic etiology, and a recurrence of similar \nanomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic  diagnosis after karyotype or CMA. In addition, \nwhen such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected \nproband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it is considered appropriate \nto of fer sequencing for both biological parents to look for shared carrier status for autosomal recessive \nmutations that might explain the fetal phenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a \nprevious abnormal fetus or child for exome sequencing is  preferable.”  \n“In families with a history of recurrent stillbirths of unknown etiology after karyotype and/or CMA, \nwhere the fetus in the current pregnancy has a recurrent pattern of anomalies (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD released an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for \nprenatal diagnosis. Below are the pertinent recommendations:  \n• “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio analysis, where fetal and both \nparental samples are sequenced and analyzed together.”  \n• “Approaches to sequence analysis may vary from examination of genes known to be associated \nwith fetal or neonatal phenotypes to a broader genome -wide strategy. It is also uncertain whether \ninterpretation of variants found by genome -wide sequencing should f ollow the general guidelines \nfor interpretation and reporting of results for children and adults, or whether a more restrictive \napproach, limited to those variants that explain the phenotype is preferable in the prenatal \nsetting, or if a new approach restr icting reporting to severe childhood conditions should be \nconsidered.”  \n• “The current existing data support that prenatal sequencing is beneficial for the following \nindications:  \no A current pregnancy with a fetus having a major single anomaly or multiple organ anomalies:  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 17 of 25 \n \n▪ For which no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA and a clinical genetic expert review \nconsiders the phenotype suggestive of a possible genetic etiology.  \n▪ For which the multiple anomaly “pattern” strongly suggests a single gene disorder with \nno prior genetic testing. As pES is not currently validated to detect all CNVs, CMA should \nbe run before or in parallel with pES in this scenario.  \no A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with \na major single or multiple anomalies:  \n▪ With a recurrence of similar anomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic \ndiagnosis after karyotype or CMA for the current or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \n▪ When such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from \nthe affected proband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it \nis considered appropriate to offer sequencing for both biological parents to lo ok for \nshared carrier status for autosomal recessive mutations that might explain the fetal \nphenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a previous abnormal fetus or \nchild for pES is preferable.  \n• There is currently no evidence that supports routine testing (including upon parental request) on \nfetal tissue obtained from an invasive prenatal procedure (amniocentesis, CVS, cordocentesis, \nother) for indications other than fetal anomalies  \no There may be special settings when prenatal sequencing in the absence of a fetal phenotype \nvisible on prenatal imaging can be considered, such as with a strong family history of a \nrecurrent childhood‐onset severe genetic condition with no prenatal phenotyp e in previous \nchildren for whom no genetic evaluation was done and is not possible. Such scenarios should \nbe reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team preferentially in the context of a research \nprotocol. If sequencing is done for this indication, it mu st be done as trio sequencing, using \nan appropriate analytical approach” (Van den Veyver et al., 2022) . \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Kang et al., 2015)  on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management \nof congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) which state: “In individuals with CMD who either do not have \na mutation identified in one of the commonly associated genes or have a phenotype whose genetic \norigins have n ot been well characterized, physicians might order whole -exome or whole -genome \nsequencing when those technologies become more accessible and affordable for routine clinical use \n(Level C).”  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Narayanaswami et al., 2014)  on the diagnosis and treatment of \nlimb -girdle and distal dystrophies which state: “In patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom \ninitial clinically directed genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic \nconsultation o r perform parallel  sequencing  of targeted exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -\ngenome screening, or next -generation  sequencing  to identify the genetic abnormality (Level C).”  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology (AMP)  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 18 of 25 \n \nThe AMP published a report on the spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing \nprocedures for inherited conditions and cancer. The background of this report states, “Whole genome \nsequencing is currently more expensive than WES, requires gr eater analysis, and generates more \nvariants of uncertain significance. WES is a plausible approach when the clinical picture cannot be \naffirmed using a specific gene panel. As technologies and understanding of variants advance, whole \ngenome sequencing migh t become the test of choice” (Joseph et al., 2016) . \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  \nAAP published guidelines on the evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorder. According to the \nguidelines, CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. Since Fragile \nX Syndrome increases the risk for autism spectrum  disorder, DNA testing for Fragile X should be \nrecommended in all children with ASD, especially for boys and children with a family history of \nintellectual disability. “The cytosine -guanine -guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion that is responsible \nfor fra gile X syndrome is not detected on CMA and must be ordered as a separate test. When the history \nand physical examination, CMA, and fragile X analysis do not identify an etiology, the next step at this \ntime in the etiologic evaluation for [autism spectrum d isorder] is whole -exome sequencing (WES).” AAP \ndoes not recommend the use of commercially marketed tests as they do not provide a molecular \netiologic diagnosis (Hyman et al., 2020) .  \nCanadian College of Medical Geneticists  \nIn 2015, the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists published a position statement on genome -wide \nsequencing for monogenic diseases. Their relevant recommendations include the following:  \n• “Recommendations for diagnostic assessment:  \no Clinical exome sequencing, at this time, should only be used to interrogate the genome for \nnucleotide sequence variants in genes known to cause disease. Clinical WGS may be used to \ndetect CNV and structural variation in addition to sequence variants, thoug h it is not currently \na first -tier test for such analyses.  \no Clinical genome -wide sequencing should be considered in the investigation of an affected \nindividual when his/her phenotype or family history suggests a monogenic aetiology in whom \nthe causal mutation(s) are unknown, and one or more of the following additio nal conditions \napply:  \n▪ the phenotype is associated with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity;  \n▪ specific genetic tests have failed to arrive at a diagnosis and testing of other clinically \nrelevant genes is appropriate;  \n▪ genome -wide sequencing is a more cost -effective approach than available individual gene \nor gene panel testing.”  \n• “Until the benefits of reporting incidental findings are established, we do not endorse the \nintentional clinical analysis of disease -associated genes other than those linked to the primary \nindication.”  \nBelow is a figure of a “decision aid to facilitate the diagnostic evaluation of patients with rare disease of \nsuspected monogenic aetiology” (Boycott et al., 2015) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 19 of 25 \n \n \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians  \nIn 2021, the Royal Austalasian  College of Physicians provided guidelines on pediatric genetic testing in \nthe context of intellectual disability (ID) and global developmental delay (GDD). For childhood \nsyndromes or ID/GDD, the group recommends WES or WGS as tests of choice, since they o ffer “a broad, \nagnostic screen,” but acknowledge that WES is more widely available and cost -effective at the time of \npublication. In terms of ordering singleton or trio testing, the group states that “the latter (trio) approach \nis highly recommended given it simplifies analysis… it is also a more streamlined clinical test as trio \ntesting identifies fewer variants of uncertain significance than singleton testing” (Sachdev et al., 2021) . \nVI.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

The WGS  was performed  in \n‘rapid  run’ mode  with  a minimum  depth  of 90 Gb per genome  and average  depth  of coverage  of 40-fold.  \nFor rapid  WES  or WGS,  the individual  should  be critically  ill and in the neonatal  or pediatric  intensive  \ncare  units  (NICU,  PICU)  when  the test is ordered  but may  be discharged  before  results  are delivered.  \nCopy  number  variation  (CNV)  analysis  should  be performed  in parallel  with  rWGS  using  chromosomal  \nmicroarray  analysis  (CMA)  or directly  within  rWGS  if the test is validated  for CNV  analysis.  \nExamples  of specific  malformations  highly  suggestive  of a genetic  etiology,  include  but are not limited  to \nany of the following:  \n• Choanal  atresia  \n• Coloboma  \n• Hirschsprung  disease  \n• Meconium  ileus  \nExamples  of an abnormal  laboratory  test suggesting  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype,  \ninclude  but are not limited  to any of the following:  \n• Abnormal  newborn  screen  \n• Conjugated  hyperbilirubinemia  not due to total  parental  nutrition  (TPN)  cholestasis  \n• Hyperammonemia  \n• Lactic  acidosis  not due to poor  perfusion  \n• Refractory  or severe  hypoglycemia  \nExamples  of clinical  features  suggesting  a genetic  disease  include  but are not limited  to any of the \nfollowing:  \n• Significant  hypotonia.  \n• Persistent  seizures.  \n• Infant  with  high  risk stratification  on evaluation  for a Brief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  (BRUE)  \n(see  below)  with  any of the following  features:  \no Recurrent  events  without  respiratory  infection  \no Recurrent  witnessed  seizure  like events  \no Required  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  \no Significantly  abnormal  chemistry  including  but not limited  to electrolytes,  bicarbonate  \nor lactic  acid,  venous  blood  gas, glucose,  or other  tests  that suggest  an inborn  error  of \nmetabolism  \n• Significantly  abnormal  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  including  but not limited  to possible  \nchannelopathies,  arrhythmias,  cardiomyopathies,  myocarditis,  or structural  heart  disease  \n• Family  history  of: \no Arrhythmia  \no BRUE  in sibling  \no Developmental  delay  \no Inborn  error  of metabolism  or genetic  disease  \no Long  QT syndrome  (LQTS)  \no Sudden  unexplained  death  (including  unexplained  car accident  or drowning)  in first- or \nsecond -degree  family  members  before  age 35, and particularly  as an infant  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   4 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  was previously  known  as Apparent  Life Threatening  Event  (ALTE).  In a \npractice  guideline  from  the American  Academy  of Pediatrics  (AAP),  BRUE  is defined  as an event  \noccurring  in an infant  younger  than  1 year  of age when  the observer  reports  a sudden,  brief  (usually  less \nthan  one minute),  and now  resolved  episode  of one or more  of the following:  \n• Absent,  decreased,  or irregular  breathing  \n• Altered  level  of responsiveness  \n• Cyanosis  or pallor  \n• Marked  change  in tone  (hyper - or hypotonia)  \nA BRUE  is diagnosed  only  when  there  is no explanation  for a qualifying  event  after  conducting  an \nappropriate  history  and physical  examination.  \nNote:  More  information  is available  at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590   \nTrio Testing  \nThe recommended  option  for testing  when  possible  is testing  of the child  and both  parents  (trio  testing).  \nTrio testing  increases  the chance  of finding  a definitive  diagnosis  and reduces  false -positive  findings.  \nTrio testing  is preferred  whenever  possible  but should  not delay  testing  of a critically  ill individual  when  \nrapid  testing  is indicated.  Testing  of one available  parent  should  be done  if both  are not immediately  \navailable  and one or both  parents  can be done  later  if needed.  \nGenetics  Nomenclature  Update  \nThe Human  Genome  Variation  Society  nomenclature  is used  to report  information  on variants  found  in \nDNA  and serves  as an international  standard  in DNA  diagnostics.  It is being  implemented  for genetic  \ntesting  medical  evidence  review  updates  starting  in 2017  (see Table  PG1).  The Society's  nomenclature  is \nrecommended  by the Human  Variome  Project,  the Human  Genome  Organisation,  and by the Human  \nGenome  Variation  Society  itself.  \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  and the Association  for Molecular  Pathology  \nstandards  and guidelines  for interpretation  of sequence  variants  represent  expert  opinion  from  both  \norganizations,  in addition  to the College  of American  Pathologists.  These  recommendations  primarily  \napply  to genetic  tests  used  in clinical  laboratories,  including  genotyping,  single  genes,  panels,  exomes,  \nand genomes.  Table  PG2 shows  the recommended  standard  terminology -\"pathogenic,\"  \"likely  \npathogenic,\"  \"uncertain  significance,\"  \"likely  benign,\"  and \"benign\" -to describe  variants  identified  that \ncause  Mendelian  disorders.  \nTable  PG1.

The interpretation  of the results  of genetic  tests  and the understanding  of risk factors  can \nbe very  difficult  and complex.  Therefore,  genetic  counseling  will assist  individuals  in understanding  the \npossible  benefits  and harms  of genetic  testing,  including  the possible  impact  of the information  on the \nindividual's  family.  Genetic  counseling  may  alter  the utilization  of genetic  testing  substantially  and may  \nreduce  inappropriate  testing.  Genetic  counseling  should  be performed  by an individual  with  experience  \nand expertise  in genetic  medicine  and genetic  testing  methods.  \nCoding  \nSee the Codes  table  for details.  \nBENEFIT  APPLICATION  \nBlue  Card/National  Account  Issues  \nSome  Plans  may  have  contract  or benefit  exclusions  for genetic  testing.  \nBenefit  Exceptions  \nThis policy  may  not apply  to all lines  of business  such  as the Federal  Employee  Program,  Medicare  \nSupplement,  Medicare  Advantage,  Medicaid,  and certain  self-insured  groups.  \nBACKGROUND  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  (WES)  is targeted  next -generation  sequencing  (NGS)  of the subset  of the \nhuman  genome  that contains  functionally  important  sequences  of protein -coding  DNA,  while  whole  \ngenome  sequencing  (WGS)  uses  NGS  techniques  to sequence  both  coding  and noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  Whole  exome  sequencing  and WGS  have  been  proposed  for use in patients  presenting  with  \ndisorders  and anomalies  not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  Potential  candidates  for WES  and \nWGS  include  patients  who  present  with  a broad  spectrum  of suspected  genetic  conditions.  \nGiven  the variety  of disorders  and management  approaches,  there  are a variety  of potential  health  \noutcomes  from  a definitive  diagnosis.  In general,  the outcomes  of a molecular  genetic  diagnosis  include  \n(1) impacting  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) informing  follow -up that can benefit  a child  by reducing  \nmorbidity,  and (3) affecting  reproductive  planning  for parents  and potentially  the affected  patient.  \nThe standard  diagnostic  workup  for patients  with  suspected  Mendelian  disorders  may  include  \ncombinations  of radiographic,  electrophysiologic,  biochemical,  biopsy,  and targeted  genetic  \nevaluations.1, The search  for a diagnosis  may  thus  become  a time -consuming  and expensive  process.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  Technology  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  using  NGS  technology  can facilitate  obtaining  a genetic  diagnosis  in \npatients  efficiently.  Whole  exome  sequencing  is limited  to most  of the protein -coding  sequence  of an \nindividual  (»85%),  is composed  of about  20,000  genes  and 180,000  exons  (protein -coding  segments  of a \ngene),  and constitutes  approximately  1% of the genome.  It is believed  that the exome  contains  about  \n85%  of heritable  disease -causing  variants.  Whole  exome  sequencing  has the advantage  of speed  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   6 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nefficiency  relative  to Sanger  sequencing  of multiple  genes.  Whole  exome  sequencing  shares  some  \nlimitations  with  Sanger  sequencing.  For example,  it will not identify  the following:  intronic  sequences  or \ngene  regulatory  regions;  chromosomal  changes;  large  deletions;  duplications;  or rearrangements  within  \ngenes,  nucleotide  repeats,  or epigenetic  changes.  Whole  genome  sequencing  uses  techniques  similar  to \nWES  but includes  noncoding  regions.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has a greater  ability  to detect  large  \ndeletions  or duplications  in protein -coding  regions  compared  with  WES  but requires  greater  data  \nanalytics.  \nTechnical  aspects  of WES  and WGS  are evolving,  including  the development  of databases  such  as the \nNational  Institutes  of Health’s  ClinVar  database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to catalog  \nvariants,  uneven  sequencing  coverage,  gaps  in exon  capture  before  sequencing,  and difficulties  with  \nnarrowing  the large  initial  number  of variants  to manageable  numbers  without  losing  likely  candidate  \ndisease -associated  variants.  The variability  contributed  by the different  platforms  and procedures  used  \nby different  clinical  laboratories  offering  exome  sequencing  as a clinical  service  is unknown.  \nIn 2013,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics,  Association  for Molecular  Pathology,  \nand College  of American  Pathologists  convened  a workgroup  to standardize  terminology  for describing  \nsequence  variants.  In 2015,  guidelines  developed  by this workgroup  describe  criteria  for classifying  \npathogenic  and benign  sequence  variants  based  on 5 categories  of data:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  \nuncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and benign.2, \nRegulatory  Status  \nClinical  laboratories  may  develop  and validate  tests  in-house  and market  them  as a laboratory  service;  \nlaboratory -developed  tests  must  meet  the general  regulatory  standards  of the Clinical  Laboratory  \nImprovement  Amendments  (CLIA).  Whole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  tests  as a clinical  service  are \navailable  under  the auspices  of the CLIA.  Laboratories  that offer  laboratory -developed  tests  must  be \nlicensed  by the CLIA  for high -complexity  testing.  To date,  the U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  \nhas chosen  not to require  any regulatory  review  of this test.  \nRATIONALE  \nThis evidence  review  was created  in September  2013  with  searches  of the PubMed  database.  The most  \nrecent  literature  update  was performed  through  January 6, 2025 . \nEvidence  reviews  assess  whether  a medical  test is clinically  useful.  A useful  test provides  information  to \nmake  a clinical  management  decision  that improves  the net health  outcome.  That  is, the balance  of \nbenefits  and harms  is better  when  the test is used  to manage  the condition  than  when  another  test or \nno test is used  to manage  the condition.  \nThe first step  in assessing  a medical  test is to formulate  the clinical  context  and purpose  of the test.  The \ntest must  be technically  reliable,  clinically  valid,  and clinically  useful  for that purpose.  Evidence  reviews  \nassess  the evidence  on whether  a test is clinically  valid  and clinically  useful.  Technical  reliability  is \noutside  the scope  of these  reviews,  and credible  information  on technical  reliability  is available  from  \nother  sources.  \nThis review  was informed  in part by a TEC Special  Report  (2013)  on exome  sequencing  for patients  with  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders.3, \nIn 2018,  Smith  et al reported  a scoping  review  of genome  and exome  sequencing  as a diagnostic  tool for \npediatric  patients.  4, The authors  identified  171 publications,  although  131 were  case  reports.  They  \nconcluded  that diagnostic  yield  was the only  consistently  reported  outcome.  The median  diagnostic  \nyield  in publications  including  more  than  single  case  reports  was 33%  but varied  by broad  clinical  \ncategories  and test type.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   7 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe following  sections  review  evidence  by test type  (whole  exome  sequencing  [WES]  and whole  genome  \nsequencing  [WGS]),  broad  type  of disorder,  and care  setting  (intensive  care  vs. not intensive  care).  \nPromotion  of greater  diversity  and inclusion  in clinical  research  of historically  marginalized  groups  (e.g.,  \nPeople  of Color  [African -American,  Asian,  Black,  Latino  and Native  American];  LGBTQIA  (Lesbian,  Gay,  \nBisexual,  Transgender,  Queer,  Intersex,  Asexual);  Women;  and People  with  Disabilities  [Physical  and \nInvisible])  allows  policy  populations  to be more  reflective  of and findings  more  applicable  to our diverse  \nmembers.  While  we also strive  to use inclusive  language  related  to these  groups  in our policies,  use of \ngender -specific  nouns  (e.g.,  women,  men,  sisters,  etc.)  will continue  when  reflective  of language  used  in \npublications  describing  study  populations.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  \nDisorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WES  in children  who  have  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  workup  is to establish  a \nmolecular  diagnosis.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  \nbe considered  clinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that are suspected  to have  a genetic  basis,  but are not \nexplained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or \na neurodevelopmental  disorder:  standard  clinical  workup  without  WES.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   8 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nA number  of studies  have  reported  on the use of WES  in clinical  practice  (Table  1). Typically,  the \npopulations  included  in these  studies  have  had suspected  rare genetic  disorders,  although  the specific  \npopulations  vary.  \nSeries  have  been  reported  with  as many  as 2000  patients.  The most  common  reason  for referral  to a \ntertiary  care  center  was an unexplained  neurodevelopmental  disorder.  Many  patients  had been  through  \na standard  clinical  workup  and testing  without  identification  of a genetic  variant  to explain  their  \ncondition.  Diagnostic  yield  in these  studies,  defined  as the proportion  of tested  patients  with  clinically  \nrelevant  genomic  anomalies,  ranged  from  25%  to 48%.  Because  there  is no reference  standard  for the \ndiagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  strategies,  clinical  confirmation  may  be the \nonly  method  for determining  false -positive  and false -negative  rates.  No reports  were  identified  of \nincorrect  diagnoses,  and how  often  they  might  occur  is unclear.  \nWhen  used  as a first-line test in infants  with  multiple  congenital  anomalies  and dysmorphic  features,  \ndiagnostic  yield  may  be as high  as 58%.  Testing  parent -child  trios  has been  reported  to increase  \ndiagnostic  yield,  to identify  an inherited  variant  from  an unaffected  parent  and be considered  benign,  or \nto identify  a de novo  variant  not present  in an unaffected  parent.  First -line trio testing  for children  with  \ncomplex  neurologic  disorders  was shown  to increase  the diagnostic  yield  (29%,  plus a possible  diagnostic  \nfinding  in 27%)  compared  with  a standard  clinical  pathway  (7%)  performed  in parallel  in the same  \npatients.5, \nTable  1.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs).  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WES  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nCohort  studies  following  children  from  presentation  to outcomes  have  not been  reported.  There  are \nconsiderable  challenges  conducting  studies  of sufficient  size given  underlying  genetic  heterogeneity,  and \nincluding  follow -up adequate  to observe  final  health  outcomes.  Studies  addressing  clinical  utility  have  \nreported  mainly  diagnostic  yield  and management  changes.  Thus,  it is difficult  to quantify  lower  or \nupper  bounds  for any potential  improvement  in the net health  outcome  owing  in part to the \nheterogeneity  of disorders,  rarity,  and outcome  importance  that may  differ  according  to identified  \npathogenic  variants.  Actionable  items  following  testing  in the reviewed  studies  (Table  1) included  family  \nplanning,  change  in management,  change  or avoidance  of additional  testing,  surveillance  for associated  \nmorbidities,  prognosis,  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nThe evidence  reviewed  here  reflects  the accompanying  uncertainty,  but supports  a perspective  that \nidentifying  a pathogenic  variant  can (1) impact  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) inform  follow -up that can \nbenefit  a child  by reducing  morbidity  and rarely  potential  mortality,  and (3) affect  reproductive  planning  \nfor parents  and later,  potentially  the affected  child.  When  recurrence  risk can be estimated  for an \nidentified  variant  (e.g., by including  parent  testing),  future  reproductive  decisions  can be affected.

Comparative  studies  have  reported  an increase  in \ndiagnostic  yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Thus,  for individuals  who  have  a suspected  \ngenetic  etiology  but for whom  the specific  genetic  alteration  is unclear  or unidentified  by a standard  \nclinical  workup,  WES  may  return  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  A genetic  diagnosis  for these  patients  is \nreported  to change  management,  including  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  \nending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  for Children  with  a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  other  than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  \nWorkup;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nMost  of the literature  on WES  is on neurodevelopmental  disorders  in children;  however,  other  potential  \nindications  for WES  have  been  reported  (Table  2). These  include  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy,  \ninherited  retinal  disease,  and other  disorders  including  mitochondrial,  endocrine,  and immunologic  \ndisorders.  \nThe purpose  of WES  in patients  who  have  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or \nheritable  disorder  may  be considered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  a disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that is suspected  to have  a genetic  \nbasis  but is not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  \nmultiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder:  a standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  \nvaries  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  \ndysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and \nimaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  \nfor that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   13 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies,  therefore  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nStudies  have  assessed  WES  for a broad  spectrum  of disorders.  The diagnostic  yield  in patient  \npopulations  restricted  to specific  phenotypes  ranges  from  3% for colorectal  cancer  to 60%  for \nunexplained  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  (Table  2). Some  studies  used  a virtual  gene  panel  that is \nrestricted  to genes  associated  with  the phenotype,  while  others  have  examined  the whole  exome,  either  \ninitially  or sequentially.  An advantage  of WES  over  individual  gene  or gene  panel  testing  is that the \nstored  data  allows  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  Whole  exome  \nsequencing  has also been  reported  to be beneficial  in patients  with  atypical  presentations.  \nTable  2.

Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for \nany specific  disorder,  and study  of WES  in these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  \nchanges  in patient  management.  \nRepeat  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test,  in individuals  who  have  \npreviously  received  WES  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  \nThe criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be considered  \nclinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   18 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test.  \nRepeat  WES  is intended  to be used  after  a WES  test has been  performed  without  establishing  a \ndiagnosis.  Repeat  testing  could  lead  to a diagnosis  in a previously  undiagnosed  individual  as new  \npathogenic  genes  or variants  are identified  or new  diagnostic  technologies  are developed.  Additionally,  \ntesting  strategies  might  be revised  based  on the emergence  of new  clinical  features  as a child  develops  \nor the identification  of congenital  anomalies  or developmental  disorders  in additional  family  members.  \nComparators  \nThe comparators  of interest  for this indication  are no further  molecular  testing  following  an initial  WES  \ntest,  and WGS  following  an initial  WES  test.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of individuals  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  individual.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of repeat  WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  of repeat  WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nSystematic  Review  \nDai et al (2022)  conducted  a systematic  review  to determine  the diagnostic  yield  of sequencing  \nreanalysis  of data  from  cases  with  no diagnosis  following  an initial  WES  or WGS  test (Table  5).33,The \nprimary  measure  of efficacy  was the proportion  of undiagnosed  individuals  reaching  a positive  diagnosis  \non reanalysis  after  first round  sequencing  and analysis.  Results  are summarized  in Table  6. The overall  \ndiagnostic  yield  was 0.10  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI], 0.06  to 0.13).  Using  the GRADE  framework,  the \ncertainty  of the evidence  for this outcome  was rated  moderate  certainty.  Confidence  in the estimate  \nwas downgraded  due to significant  heterogeneity  across  studies  that could  not be explained  by \nsubgroup  analyses.  The researchers  performed  subgroup  analyses  on the basis  of time  interval  between  \nthe original  analysis  and reanalysis  (<24  months  compared  with  ≥24 months),  sequencing  methodology  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   19 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n(WES  vs. WGS),  study  sample  size (<50,  50 to 100,  >100  patients),  sequencing  of family  members  for \nsegregation  analysis,  whether  research  validation  of novel  variants/genes  were  conducted,  and whether  \nany artificial  intelligence -based  tools  were  used  in variant  curation.  These  subgroup  analyses  did not \nidentify  any statistically  significant  differences  in diagnostic  yield  estimates.  \nTable  5.

In 62%  of these  cases  the reason  was a new  gene  discovery,  in 15%  the reasons  were  \nunknown  or unspecified,  and in 11%  the reason  was validation  of candidate  variants  through  research  or \nexternal  collaboration.  Other  reasons  included  bioinformatic  pipeline  improvements  (3.3%),  laboratory  \nerrors/misinterpretations  (2.8%),  updated  clinical  phenotypes  (2.1%),  copy  number  variants  (1.9%),  and \nadditional  segregation  studies  in relatives  (1.2%).  \nOnly  7 of 29 studies  provided  individual  clinical  information  of sequenced  probands  (e.g.,  diagnosed  \nvariant,  or timing  of reanalysis)  but instead  reported  summary  data  of the overall  population.  There  \nwere  11 studies  that reported  the finding  of variants  of uncertain  significance  (VUS)  and/or  variants  in \nnovel  genes  but only  8 studies  provided  research  evidence  confirming  their  pathogenicity.  Only  3 studies  \ndiscussed  whether  a genetic  diagnosis  led to management  changes,  and the impact  on management  was \nonly  described  in a subgroup  of individuals.  To address  uncertainties  in the evidence,  the review  authors  \nrecommended  best  practices  for future  research  including  detailed  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria,  \ndetailed  clinical  information  on each  case,  clear  documentation  of methodology  used  for initial  and re-\nanalysis,  and reporting  of the rationale  for attribution  of pathogenicity.  \nNonrandomized  Studies  \nTable  7 summarizes  nonrandomized  studies  published  after  the Dai et al (2022)  systematic  review.

The net health  outcome  can be \nimproved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  more  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or \ntesting.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of repeat  WES  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  following  an initial  WES  test were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nDue to heterogeneity  and limitations  in individuals  studies,  the evidence  is insufficient  to establish  a \nchain  of evidence  for the clinical  utility  of repeat  WES  testing  in individuals  who  are undiagnosed  \nfollowing  an initial  WES  test.  \nSection  Summary:  Repeat  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  \nIn a systematic  review  of nonrandomized  studies,  re-analysis  of WES  data  resulted  in an 11%  increase  in \ndiagnostic  yield  (95%  CI 8% to 14%)  in individuals  who  were  previously  undiagnosed  via WES.  However,  \nthe evidence  is insufficient  to establish  the clinical  utility  of repeat  testing.  Individual  studies  lacked  \ndetail  on the reasons  for new  diagnoses,  changes  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the \nfrequency  of the identification  of VUS.  Additionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  \nestablished,  and there  are no clear  guidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  \ntesting.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup  or Whole  Exome  \nSequencing;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  is to establish  a \nmolecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the genome.  The criteria  under  \nwhich  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be considered  clinically  useful  are stated  \nabove.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   23 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup.  \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible.  Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  as a \nclinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practices  are currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  A standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS,  and WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  Compared  to Standard  Clinical  Workup  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   24 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  workup  \nin several  observational  studies,  both  prospective  and retrospective.

Ten studies (ES=9; GS=1), \ncomprising 1905 probands, compared diagnostic rate among pediatric vs adult patients within cohorts, \nfinding pediatric patients had 1.6 -times odds of a diagnosis compared to that of adult patients (95% CI \n1.22 -2.10, I 2 = 0%, P <.01).  \nAcross all age groups, diagnostic rates of whole exome sequencing (0.38; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.40) and \nwhole genome sequencing (0.34; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.38) were similar (p=.1). Within -cohort comparison \nfrom 9 studies (2269 probands) showed 1.2 -times odds of diagnosis by whole genome sequencing over \nwhole exome sequencing (95% CI: 0.79 to 1.83; p=.38).Whole genome sequencing studies identified a \nhigher range of novel genes (GS: 2 -579 novel genes based on 6 studies, 5538 probands vs. ES: 1 -75 novel \ngenes based on 22 studies, 5038 probands). Variants of unknown significance (VUS) had wide ranges for \nboth ES and GS (ES: <1 -59%; GS: 6 -50%; p=.78), with severe heterogeneity in methodology and \nreporting. Overall, VUS showed a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2021.  \nThe quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool was used to assess bias in the included \nstudies. Studies with a low bias ranking in all domains were deemed high -quality and were used in a \nseparate analysis. Among the 22 high -quality studies (4,580 probands), the clinical utility of whole \ngenome sequencing (0.77; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.90) was higher than that of whole exome sequencing (0.44; \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   28 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n95% CI: 0.30 to 0.58) (p<.01). It is unclear if any study compared whole exome sequencing with \nassessment of structural variants versus whole genome sequencing.  \nA 2020  Health  Technology  Assessment  conducted  by Ontario  Health,  with  literature  searches  conducted  \nin January  2019,  included  a comparative  review  of the diagnostic  yield  of WES  and WGS  in children  with  \nunexplained  developmental  disabilities  or multiple  congenital  anomalies.45, The diagnostic  yield  across  \nall studies  was 37%  (95%  CI, 34%  to 40%).  More  studies,  with  an overall  larger  sample  size,  were  \nincluded  in the examination  on WES  (34 studies,  N=9142)  than  on WGS  (9 studies,  N=648).  Confidence  \nintervals  for studies  using  WES  versus  WGS  overlapped  (37%;  95%  CI, 34%  to 40%,  vs. 40%;  95%  CI, 32%  \nto 49%).  Diagnostic  yield  ranged  between  16%  and 73%,  with  variation  attributed  largely  to technology  \nused  and participant  selection.  The overall  quality  of the evidence  was rated  as very  low,  downgraded  \nfor risk of bias,  inconsistency,  indirectness,  and imprecision.  \nIn some  studies  of WGS,  the genes  examined  were  those  previously  associated  with  the phenotype,  \nwhile  other  studies  were  research -based  and conducted  more  exploratory  analysis.  It has been  noted  \nthat genomes  sequenced  with  WGS  are available  for future  review  when  new  variants  associated  with  \nclinical  diseases  are discovered.37, \nStudies  have  shown  that WGS  can detect  more  pathogenic  variants  than  WES,  due to an improvement  in \ndetecting  copy  number  variants,  insertions  and deletions,  intronic  single -nucleotide  variants,  and exonic  \nsingle -nucleotide  variants  in regions  with  poor  coverage  on WES.  A majority  of studies  have  described  \nmethods  for interpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  \nincluded  in the diagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  not reported.  Five studies  included  in the Ontario  \nHealth  Technology  Assessment  review  provided  data  on the yield  of VUS,  with  an overall  yield  of 17%.  \nOnly  1 of the 5 studies  used  WGS,  however.  The review  authors  noted,  \"Whole  genome  sequencing  \nalways  results  in substantially  longer  lists of variants  of unknown  significance  than  whole  exome  \nsequencing  does.  Interpreting  and acting  upon  variants  of unknown  clinical  significance  is the single  \ngreatest  challenge  identified  by clinicians….”45, \nClinically  Useful  \nA test is clinically  useful  if the use of the results  informs  management  decisions  that improve  the net \nhealth  outcome  of care.  The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  or \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WGS  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  outside  of critical  care  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nClinical  validity  is established  based  on the meaningful  diagnostic  yield  associated  with  WGS  when  a \ngenetic  etiology  is uncertain  after  standard  workup.  Studies  on WGS  report  changes  in management  \nthat would  improve  health  outcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as \nthose  with  WES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   29 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup;  Individuals  who  are \nnot Critically  Ill \nWhole  genome  sequencing  has been  studied  in non-critically  ill children  with  congenital  anomalies  and \ndevelopmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup.  The diagnostic  yield  for WGS  \nhas been  reported  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for interpretation  of \nWGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the diagnostic  yield  \nand that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of WGS  is at least  as high  as \nWES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is unclear  if the additional  \nyield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  outcomes.  Further,  while  \nreporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  across  laboratories,  WGS  \nresults  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of this difference  are \nuncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS reclassification  allowing  a \ndiagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the occurrence  of medical  \nmismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well defined,  and provider  \nreluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS identification  by WGS.  As \nsuch,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  utility.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  Congenital  \nAnomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup.  \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible.  Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  The \nmedian  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  \ncondition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   30 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  in several  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective.  Studies  are described  in Table  13. The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has \nbeen  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  studies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  \npopulations  and include  little  information  about  associated  changes  in management  following  genetic  \ndiagnosis.  \nTable  13.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WGS  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nA genetic  diagnosis  for an unexplained  disorder  can alter  management  in several  ways:  such  a diagnosis  \nmay  lead  to genetic  counseling  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and may  affect  reproductive  decision  \nmaking.  \nBecause  the clinical  validity  of WGS  for this indication  has not been  established,  a chain  of evidence  \ncannot  be constructed.  \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nWhole  genome  sequencing  has also been  studied  in children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  \nthan  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  \nfollowing  standard  workup.  The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has been  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  \nstudies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  populations  and include  little  information  about  \nassociated  changes  in management  following  genetic  diagnosis.  \nRapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of rapid  WES  (rWES)  or rWGS  in critically  ill patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of \nunknown  etiology  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of \nthe genome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe most  common  cause  of death  in neonates  in the United  States  is genetic  disorders.  Currently,  \ncritically  ill neonates  with  suspected  genetic  diseases  are frequently  discharged  or deceased  without  a \ndiagnosis.  There  are thousands  of rare genetic  disorders.  The presentation  of many  of these  disorders  in \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   34 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nneonates  may  be nonspecific  or differ  from  the presentation  in older  patients  and the disorder  may  \nproduce  secondary  involvement  of other  systems  due to the fragility  of the neonate  that obscures  the \nprimary  pathology.  The neonatal  intensive  care  unit (NICU)  treatment  of suspected  genetic  diseases  is \noften  empirical.  Rapid  diagnosis  is critical  for delivery  of interventions  that reduce  morbidity  and \nmortality  in genetic  diseases  for which  treatments  exist.  For many  genetic  diseases  there  is no effective  \ntreatment  and timely  diagnosis  limits  futile  intensive  care.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is critically  ill infants  presenting  with  any of a variety  of disorders  and \nanomalies  suspected  to have  a genetic  basis  but not explained  by a standard  workup.  For example,  \npatients  may  have  a phenotype  that does  not correspond  with  a specific  disorder  for which  a genetic  \ntest targeting  a specific  gene  is available.  Specifically  for critically  ill infants,  the population  would  also \ninclude  patients  for whom  specific  diagnostic  tests  available  for that phenotype  are not accessible  within  \na reasonable  timeframe.  Petrikin  (2018)  identified  critically  ill infants  that are appropriate  for rapid  \ntesting  as meeting  the following  inclusion  criteria:  multiple  congenital  anomalies;  an abnormal  \nlaboratory  test suggests  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype;  an abnormal  response  to \nstandard  therapy  for a major  underlying  condition;  significant  hypotonia;  or persistent  seizures.  \nExclusion  criteria  included:  an infection  with  normal  response  to therapy;  isolated  prematurity;  isolated  \nunconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia;  Hypoxic  Ischemic  Encephalopathy;  confirmed  genetic  diagnosis  \nexplains  illness;  Isolated  Transient  Neonatal  Tachypnea;  or nonviable  neonates.53, \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  \n• rapid  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible  \n• rapid  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible  \nSeveral  laboratories  offer  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rWES  or \nrWGS  or standard  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nIn its 2021  guideline,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  defines  rapid  and \nultrarapid  testing  as 6 to 15 days  and 1 to 3 days,  respectively.54, \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WES  or WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  \ndiagnosis  or screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  a standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  \ngenetic  condition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nOutcomes  of interest  are as described  above  for use of WES  in patients  with  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder.  For critically  ill infants,  rapid  diagnosis  is important;  \ntherefore,  in addition  to the outcomes  described  in the previous  section,  time  to diagnosis  and time  to \ndischarge  are also outcomes  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   35 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOf course,  mortality  is a compelling  outcome.  However,  many  of the conditions  are untreatable  and \ndiagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care  but may  not \nprolong  survival.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of rWES  or rWGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rWES  or rWGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of rWES  and rWGS  has been  studied  in critically  ill children  in multiple  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective,  and in 3 RCTs.  Studies  are described  in Table  16. The RCTs  are \ndiscussed  in more  detail  in the following  ‘clinically  useful’  section.  One study  included  only  infants  with  \ncardiac  defects  and had a diagnostic  yield  of 6% with  WGS.  The remaining  studies  included  \nphenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill infants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%.  \nTable  16.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials.  \nRandomized  Controlled  Trials  \nThree  RCTs  have  evaluated  rWGS  or rWES  in critically  ill infants  or children.  \nKingsmore  et al (2019)  reported  early  results  of A Randomized,  Blinded,  Prospective  Study  of the Clinical  \nUtility  of Rapid  Genomic  Sequencing  for Infants  in the Acute -care  Setting  (NSIGHT2)  trial66,. NSIGHT2  was \na randomized,  controlled,  blinded  trial of the effectiveness  of rapid  whole -genome  or -exome  \nsequencing  (rWGS  or rWES,  respectively)  in seriously  ill infants  with  diseases  of unknown  etiology  \nprimarily  from  the NICU,  pediatric  intensive  care  unit (PICU),  and cardiovascular  intensive  care  unit \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   42 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n(CVICU)  at a single  hospital  in San Diego.  Details  of the study  are provided  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. Ninety -five infants  were  randomized  to rWES  and 94 to rWGS.  In addition,  24 infants  \nwho  were  gravely  ill received  ultrarapid  WGS  (urWGS).  The initial  Kingsmore  et al (2019)  publication  \nincluded  only  the diagnostic  outcomes.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. 20%,  \nrespectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  Although  the urWGS  was not part of the \nrandomized  portion  of the study,  the proportion  diagnosed  by urWGS  was 11 of 24 (46%)  and time  to \nresult  was a median  of 4.6 days.  The incremental  diagnostic  yield  of reflexing  to trio testing  after  \ninconclusive  proband  analysis  was 0.7%  (1 of 147).  In 2020,  Dimmock  et al reported  results  of the \nprimary  endpoint  of NSIGHT2:  clinician  perception  that rWGS  was useful  and clinician -reported  changes  \nin management.67, Clinicians  provided  perceptions  of the clinical  utility  of diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  \nfor 201 of 213 infants  randomized  (94%).  In 154 (77%)  infants,  diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  was \nperceived  to be useful  or very  useful;  perceptions  of usefulness  did not differ  between  infants  who  \nreceived  rWES  and rWGS,  nor between  urWGS  and rWES/rWGS.  Thirty -two (15%)  of 207 clinician  \nresponses  indicated  that diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  changed  infant  outcomes  (by targeted  \ntreatments  in 21 [10%]  infants,  avoidance  of complications  in 16 [8%],  and institution  of palliative  care  in \n2 [1%]  infants).  Changes  in outcome  did not differ  significantly  between  infants  randomized  to rWES  and \nrWGS,  although  urWGS  was associated  with  a significantly  higher  rate of change  in management  than  \nrWES/rWGS  (63%  vs. 23%;  p=.0001).  \nPetrikin  et al (2018)  reported  on the Prospective  Randomized  Trial  of the Clinical  Utility  of Rapid  Next  \nGeneration  Sequencing  in Acutely  Ill Neonates  (NSIGHT1;  NCT02225522)  RCT of rWGS  to diagnose  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants.53, In brief,  NSIGHT1  was an investigator -initiated  \n(funded  by the National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute  and Eunice  Kennedy  Shriver  National  \nInstitute  of Child  Health  and Human  Development),  blinded,  and pragmatic  trial comparing  trio rWGS  \nwith  standard  genetic  tests  to standard  genetic  tests  alone  with  a primary  outcome  of the proportion  of \nNICU/PICU  infants  receiving  a genetic  diagnosis  within  28 days.  Parents  of patients  and clinicians  were  \nunblinded  after  10 days  and compassionate  cross -over  to rWGS  occurred  in 5 control  patients.  The study  \nwas designed  to enroll  500 patients  in each  group  but was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on \nthe part of study  clinicians  who  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus \ntrio rWGS.  Intention -to-treat  analyses  were  reported,  i.e., crossovers  were  included  in the group  to \nwhich  they  were  randomized.  The trial required  confirmatory  testing  of WGS  results,  which  lengthened  \nthe time  to rWGS  diagnosis  by 7 to 10 days.  Study  characteristics  are shown  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. \nIn the NICUSeq  RCT,  Krantz  et al (2021)  compared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  \nreporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  \nunit (ICU)  with  a suspected  genetic  disease  at 5 sites  in the US.68, In 76%  of cases,  both  parents  were  \navailable  for trio testing.  Overall,  82 of 354 infants  received  a diagnosis  (23%),  with  a higher  yield  in the \n15-day group  (Table  19). The primary  outcome  was change  in management,  measured  at day 60. \nSignificantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  the delayed  \narm (21.1%  vs 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Changes  in management  included  \nsubspecialty  referral  (21 of 354,  6.0%),  changes  to medication  (5 of 354,  1.4%),  therapeutics  specific  to \nthe primary  genetic  etiology  (7 of 354;  2.0%)  and surgical  interventions  (12 of 354;  3.4%).  Survival  and \nlength  of stay did not differ  between  the groups.  \nTable  19.

Studies  on rWGS  report  changes  in management  that would  improve  health  \noutcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as those  with  WES,  including  \navoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  discontinuation  of or \nadditional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  A chain  of evidence  linking  \nmeaningful  improvements  in diagnostic  yield  and changes  in management  expected  to improve  health  \noutcomes  supports  the clinical  value  of WES  and WGS  for critically  ill infants.  \nSection  Summary:  Rapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nFor critically  ill infants,  disease  may  progress  rapidly  and genetic  diagnoses  must  be made  quickly.  \nSeveral  retrospective  and prospective  observational  studies  with  sample  sizes  ranging  from  about  20 to \nmore  than  275 (in total  including  more  than  450 critically  ill infants  or children)  reported  on diagnostic  \nyield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse,  but critically  ill, infants  and had \nyields  between  30%  and 60%  and reports  of changes  in management  such  as avoidance  of invasive  \nprocedures,  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  \ncare.  \nThree  RCTs  have  evaluated  rWGS  in critically  ill infants  or children.  An RCT comparing  trio rWGS  with  \nstandard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants  funded  by the \nNational  Institutes  of Health  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on the part of study  clinicians  \nwho  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus trio rWGS.  The rate of \ngenetic  diagnosis  within  28 days  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; \np=.003)  and the time  to diagnosis  was shorter  (13 days  vs. 107 days;  p=.002).  The age at hospital  \ndischarge  and mortality  rates  were  similar  in the 2 groups.  However,  many  of the conditions  are \nuntreatable  and diagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care,  \nbut may  not prolong  survival.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill infants  with  diseases  \nof unknown  etiology  from  the NICU,  PICU,  and CVICU.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was \nsimilar  (19%  vs. 20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT \ncompared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  \nreturned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an ICU with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  \nSummary  of Evidence  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  receive  whole  \nexome  sequencing  (WES)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  large  case  series  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   47 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nwithin -subject  comparisons.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in \nreproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  Patients  who  have  multiple  congenital  anomalies  \nor a developmental  disorder  with  a suspected  genetic  etiology,  but whose  specific  genetic  alteration  is \nunclear  or unidentified  by a standard  clinical  workup,  may  be left without  a clinical  diagnosis  of their  \ndisorder,  despite  a lengthy  diagnostic  workup.  For a substantial  proportion  of these  patients,  WES  may  \nreturn  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  Several  large  and smaller  series  have  reported  diagnostic  yields  of \nWES  ranging  from  25%  to 60%,  depending  on the individual’s  age,  phenotype,  and previous  workup.  \nOne comparative  study  found  a 44%  increase  in yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Many  \nof the studies  have  also reported  changes  in patient  management,  including  medication  changes,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  The \nevidence  is sufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  \nreceive  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  small  case  series  and prospective  \nresearch  studies.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  \ndecision  making,  and resource  utilization.  There  is an increasing  number  of reports  evaluating  the use of \nWES  to identify  a molecular  basis  for disorders  other  than  multiple  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders.  The diagnostic  yields  in these  studies  range  from  as low as 3% to 60%.  \nSome  studies  have  reported  on the use of a virtual  gene  panel  with  restricted  analysis  of disease -\nassociated  genes,  and WES  data  allow  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  \nOverall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  disorder,  and clinical  use of WES  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  changes  in patient  management.  The \nevidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES  who  receive  repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of \nprevious  test results,  the evidence  includes  nonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  There  is no direct  evidence  of clinical  utility.  In a meta -analysis  of nonrandomized  studies,  re-\nanalysis  of WES  data  resulted  in an 11%  increase  in diagnostic  yield  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI), 8% to \n14%)  in individuals  who  were  previously  undiagnosed  via WES.  Three  nonrandomized  studies  published  \nafter  the meta -analysis  had findings  consistent  with  the meta -analysis.  Conclusions  were  limited  by \nheterogeneity  across  individual  studies  and a lack of detailed  reporting  on reasons  for new  diagnoses,  \nchanges  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the frequency  of the identification  of variants  of \nuncertain  significance  (VUS).  Therefore,  a chain  of evidence  for clinical  utility  cannot  be established.  \nAdditionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  established,  and there  are no clear  \nguidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  testing.  The evidence  is insufficient  to \ndetermine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  or WES  who  \nreceive  whole  genome  sequencing  (WGS)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  \nnonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  \noutcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  In studies  of children  with  \ncongenital  anomalies  and developmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  clinical  workup,  \nthe yield  of WGS  has ranged  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for \ninterpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the \ndiagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  In a systematic  review,  the pooled  (9 \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   48 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nstudies,  N=648)  diagnostic  yield  of WGS  was 40%  (95%  CI, 32%  to 49%).  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of \nWGS  is at least  as high  as WES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is \nunclear  if the additional  yield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  \noutcomes.  Further,  while  reporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  \nacross  laboratories,  WGS  results  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of \nthis difference  are uncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS \nreclassification  allowing  a diagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the \noccurrence  of medical  mismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well \ndefined,  and provider  reluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS \nidentification  by WGS.  As such,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  \nutility.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the \nnet health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  who  receive  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  case  series.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has also been  studied  in other  genetic  conditions  with  yield  \nranging  from  9% to 55%.  Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  \ndisorder,  and clinical  use of WGS  as well as information  regarding  meaningful  changes  in management  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  \nresults  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are critically  ill infants  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  \nfollowing  a standard  workup  who  receive  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  or rapid  WES  (rWES)  with  trio testing  when  \npossible,  the evidence  includes  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and case  series.  Relevant  outcomes  \nare test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  \nOne RCT comparing  rWGS  with  standard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in \ncritically  ill infants  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise.  The rate of genetic  diagnosis  within  28 \ndays  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; p=.003).  Changes  in \nmanagement  due to test results  were  reported  in 41%  (p=.11)  of rWGS  versus  21%  of control  patients;  \nhowever,  73%  of control  subjects  received  broad  genetic  tests  (e.g., next -generation  sequencing  panel  \ntesting,  WES,  or WGS)  as part of standard  testing.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill \ninfants  with  diseases  of unknown  etiology  from  the neonatal  intensive  care  unit,  pediatric  intensive  care  \nunit,  and cardiovascular  intensive  care  unit.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. \n20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT compared  rWGS  \n(test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 \ndays)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  unit with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Several  retrospective  \nand prospective  studies  including  more  than  800 critically  ill infants  and children  in total  have  reported  \non diagnostic  yield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill \ninfants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%  for pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants.  Studies  \nhave  also reported  associated  changes  in patient  management  for patients  receiving  a diagnosis  from  \nrWGS  or rWES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.

Priority  will be given  to guidelines  that are \ninformed  by a systematic  review,  include  strength  of evidence  ratings,  and include  a description  of \nmanagement  of conflict  of interest.  \nAmerican  Academy  of Neurology  et al \nIn 2014,  the American  Academy  of Neurology  and American  Association  of Neuromuscular  and \nElectrodiagnostic  Medicine  issued  evidence -based  guidelines  on the diagnosis  and treatment  of limb -\ngirdle  and distal  dystrophies,  which  made  the following  recommendations  (Table  23).69, \nTable  23. Guidelines  on Limb -Girdle  Muscular  Dystrophy  \nRecommendation  LOE \nDiagnosis   \n• For patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy,  clinicians  should  use a clinical  approach  to guide  \ngenetic  diagnosis  based  on the clinical  phenotype,  including  the pattern  of muscle  involvement,  \ninheritance  pattern,  age at onset,  and associated  manifestations  (e.g., early  contractures,  cardiac  \nor respiratory  involvement).  B \n• In patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy  in whom  initial  clinically  directed  genetic  testing  \ndoes  not provide  a diagnosis,  clinicians  may  obtain  genetic  consultation  or perform  parallel  \nsequencing  of targeted  exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -genome  screening,  or next -\ngeneration  sequencing  to identify  the genetic  abnormality.  C \nManagement  of cardiac  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  refer  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  (1) limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  \n(LGMD)1A,  LGMD1B,  LGMD1D,  LGMD1E,  LGMD2C –K, LGMD2M –P, … or (2) muscular  dystrophy  \nwithout  a specific  genetic  diagnosis  for cardiology  evaluation,  including  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  \nand structural  evaluation  (echocardiography  or cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  [MRI]),  even  \nif they  are asymptomatic  from  a cardiac  standpoint,  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• If ECG or structural  cardiac  evaluation  (e.g., echocardiography)  has abnormal  results,  or if the \npatient  has episodes  of syncope,  near -syncope,  or palpitations,  clinicians  should  order  rhythm  \nevaluation  (e.g., Holter  monitor  or event  monitor)  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  palpitations,  symptomatic  or \nasymptomatic  tachycardia  or arrhythmias,  or signs  and symptoms  of cardiac  failure  for cardiology  \nevaluation.  B \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2A,  LGMD2B,  and LGMD2L  for cardiac  \nevaluation  unless  they  develop  overt  cardiac  signs  or symptoms.  B \nManagement  of pulmonary  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  order  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  \ninspiratory/expiratory  force  in the upright  and,  if normal,  supine  positions)  or refer  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  (to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency)  in muscular  dystrophy  patients  at the \ntime  of diagnosis,  or if they  develop  pulmonary  symptoms  later  in their  course.  B \n• In patients  with  a known  high  risk of respiratory  failure  (e.g., those  with  LGMD2I  …), clinicians  \nshould  obtain  periodic  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  inspiratory/expiratory  B \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   50 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nforce  in the upright  position  and,  if normal,  in the supine  position)  or evaluation  by a \npulmonologist  to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency.  \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2B  and LGMD2L  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  unless  they  are symptomatic.  C \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  excessive  daytime  somnolence,  \nnonrestorative  sleep  (e.g., frequent  nocturnal  arousals,  morning  headaches,  excessive  daytime  \nfatigue),  or respiratory  insufficiency  based  on pulmonary  function  tests  for pulmonary  or sleep  \nmedicine  consultation  for consideration  of noninvasive  ventilation  to improve  quality  of life.

States  can define  EHBs  for their  respective  state.  \nStates  vary  on how  they  define  the term  small  group.  In Idaho,  a small  group  employer  is defined  as an \nemployer  with  at least  two but no more  than  fifty eligible  employees  on the first day of the plan  or \ncontract  year,  the majority  of whom  are employed  in Idaho.   Large  group  employers,  whether  they  are \nself-funded  or fully  insured,  are not required  to offer  EHBs,  but may  voluntar ily offer  them.   \nThe ACA requires  any benefit  plan  offering  EHBs  to remove  all dollar  limits  for EHBs.  \nREFERENCES  \n1.

Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Definitions  \n \nComparator : A DNA sequence that is used to compare to the individual’s DNA sequence. This may be a parent or sibling \nof the individual, or non -cancerous tissue that is being compared to the individual’s tumor tissue (Thun et al., 2017).  \n \nConsanguinity : Procreation with second- cousins or closer ( Bennett et al., 2021).  \n \nGlobal Developmental Delay:  A significant delay in 2 or more developmental domains, including gross or fine motor, \nspeech/language, cognitive, social/personal, and activities of daily living with onset prior to 5 years of age (Shevell et al ., \n2003) . \n \nIntellectual Disability : A condition diagnosed before age 18 that includes below -average intellectual function and a lack \nof skills necessary for daily living  (MedlinePlus , 2020 a). \n \nNext Generation Sequencing (NGS) : New sequencing techniques that can quickly analyze multiple sections of DNA at \nthe same time. Older forms of sequencing could only analyze one section of DNA at once.  \n Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) : A test performed to analyze the DNA from oocytes or embryos for human \nleukocyte antigen (HLA) -typing or for determining genetic abnormalities. These include:  \n PGT-A: For aneuploidy screening (formerly PGS)  \n PGT-M: For monogenic/single gene defects (formerly single -gene PGD)  \n PGT-SR: For chromosomal structural rearrangements (formerly chromosomal PGD)  \n(Zegers -Hochschild et al., 2017)  \n Variant of Unknown Significance (VUS) : A variation in a genetic sequence that has an unknown association with \ndisease. It may also be called an unclassified variant  (MedlinePlus 2020c) . \n Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) : About 1% of a person’s DNA makes protein. These protein making sections are \ncalled exons. All the exons together are called the exome. WES is a DNA analysis technique that looks at all of the exons \nin a person at one time, rather than gene by gene ( MedlinePlus , 2020b).  \n Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) : WGS determines the sequence of all of the DNA in a person, which includes the \nprotein making (coding) as well as non -coding DNA elements ( MedlinePlus , 2020b). \n \nApplicable Codes  \n The following list(s) of procedure and/or diagnosis codes is provided for reference purposes only and may not be all \ninclusive. Listing of a code in this policy does not imply that the service described by the code is a covered or non -covered \nhealth servic e. Benefit coverage for health services is determined by the member specific benefit plan document and \napplicable laws that may require coverage for a specific service. The inclusion of a code does not imply any right to reimbursement or guarantee claim payment.

The exome is the portion of an individual’s genome that encodes protein (also known as exons).  Exons make up approximately 1- 2% of the genome (Chung, 2023).  Most known \ndisease- causing variants are found in the exons and by sequencing them all simultaneously, a more efficient analysis can \nbe completed than by sequencing each individual gene alone (Bertier et al., 2016). WES results in long lists of genetic \nvariants ; the success of this technology is dependent on how consistently and accurately labs can identify disease \ncausing mutations (Richards et al., 2015).  \n \nWGS determines the order of all the nucleotides in an individual's DNA and can determine variations in any part of the \ngenome ( MedlinePlus , 2020b).  This provides the potential to detect disease- causing copy number variants (CNVs) and \nstructural variations (SVs), repeat expansions and nonexonic regulatory and splicing variations (Chung, 2023). As with \nWES, WGS results in long lists of unknown variants . The methodology and databases available to interpret WGS are the \nsame as WES and focus primarily on the exons (Richards et al., 2015; Landrum et al., 2016 ). WES and WGS are \nincreasingly clinically available due to significant advances in DNA sequencing technology over the last several years \n(Taber et al., 2015 ).  \n \nAnother type of analysis, whole transcriptome sequencing, identifies and characterizes both coding and noncoding \nribonucleic acid ( RNA ). To carry out the instructions housed in the base pairs of chemicals making up an individual’s \ngenes, DNA must be transcribed into RNA. These “readouts” of genes are called transcripts; a transcriptome is the collective of all the gene readouts in a cell (National Human Genome Research Institute, 2020). Whole transcriptome \nsequencing analyzes all of the sequences of RNA pre sent in a tissue and has the ability to provide additional and/or \ndifferent information than can be obtained from DNA -based sequencing. Use of this technology has been proposed for \nmultiple clinical purposes, including rare genetic diseases and oncology in dications.  \n \nWhole genome optical mapping, also called optical genome mapping (OGM),  uses technology such as high- resolution \nmicroscopy, automated image analysis, and microfluidics to image very long, linear single DNA molecules in which labels \nhave been placed at specific sites to construct a genome “map” of the sample under study along with a reference sample. \nThis can be used to identify SVs in the genome, including insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions,  and \ntranslocations, even when these variations are very small. The current paradigm  for detection of SVs is standard \ncytogenetics  which have lower resolution and are not able to detect balanced SVs or genomic location and orientation of \ninsertions or duplications  (Mantere et al., 2021) . OGM is currently being studied for potential application in human genetic \ndiagnostics.  \n \nClinical Evidence  \n \nChung et al. (2023) published a meta- analysis of 161 studies comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of exome \nsequencing (ES)  and genome sequencing (GS)  in both adult and pediatric populations with rare diseases.  The meta -\nanalysis included 50,417 probands from 31 different countries/regions representing diverse populations  over a period of \n10 years (2011- 2021) . Eligible studies reported the diagnostic rate (defined as the percentage of individuals with an \nidentified casual variant that could explain t he individual’s phenotype based on evidence such as mode of inheritance, \nprevious reporting,  and functional evidence) of both ES and GS. When available, additional results such as clinical utility \n(defined as percentage of individuals experiencing changes to clinical management  following a diagnosis by ES or GS) , \nrates of variants of uncertain significance ( VUS) , number of novel genes, health economic data and diagnostic rates from \nES reanalysis were also extracted from the studies  and evaluated. The analys is revealed co mparable diagnostic rates of \nES (0.38, 95% CI 0.36 -0.40) and GS (0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38) ( p = .1) overall , and in a subgroup of 22 studies deemed to \nbe high quality per QUADAS -2 assessment (ES: 0.43, 95% CI 0.35 -0.51, 13 studies, n = 2612, I2 = 94%, GS: 0.34, 95% \nCI 0.28 -0.41, 11 studies, n = 2,170, I2 = 88%) . Studies that focused on GS identified a higher range of novel genes than \nthose focused on ES  (2-579 for GS  vs 1-75 for ES) , but the rate of VUS was not significantly different (p = .78). Of the \nnine studies (2,269 probands)  that compared ES and GS, the odds of diagnosis via GS was 1.2 times  greater  than ES \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 7 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n (95% CI 0.79 -1.83, p = .38). Another subgroup analysis  compared diagnostic rates in children vs adults  regardless of \nanalysis with ES or GS ; children had 1.6 times greater likelihood of obtaining a diagnosis than adults (95% CI 1.22- 2.10, \nI2 = 0%, p < .01). With re spect to reanalysis of ES, nine total studies (1,748 individuals) reported results . Time to \nreanalysis varied from one month to 3.4 years after initial negative results, and additional diagnostic rate from reanalysis \nwas 1% -16%. A significant dif ference  in the diagnostic rate between  ES reanalysis and GS was identified (0.43, 95% CI \n0.36- 0.50, 9 studies, n = 2, 361, I2 = 89% vs 0.34, 95% CI 0.30- 0.38, 40 studies, n = 11,207, I2 = 95%), but limited data \nprevented additional statistical comparison. The clinical utility of GS (0.61, 95% CI 0.50- 0.73, 16 studies, n = 3686, I2 = \n94%) was found to be higher than that of ES (0.48, 95% CI 0.40 -0.56, 47 studies, n = 8869, I2 = 97%) in pooled meta -\nanalysis. Additionally,  of ten QUADAS -2 assessed , high- quality  studies  (2,170 probands ) reporting on clinical utility , GS \nwas found to have significantly higher clinical utility  than ES (0.77, 95% CI 0.64- 0.90 vs. 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 -0.58, \nrespectively) ( p < .01). The authors indicate that these findings, along with the growing body of recommendations for \nclinical interpretation of variants located in noncoding regions of the genome, will likely lead to more common use of GS \nfor clinical evaluation.  \n \nTo further evaluate the overall diagnostic yield of ES and CMA for individuals with short stature, Li et al. (2023) performed \na systematic review and meta- analysis  of relevant published literature. Twenty studies , including 1,350 individuals tested \nwith ES and 1,070 individuals tested with CMA , met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. To be included, \nstudies were required to have at least ten participants with short stature diagnosed via ES or CMA. Also evaluated was \npotential variation i n diagnostic yield dependent on whether ES was used as a first -tier test or a test of last -resort, and an \nanalysis of variation of diagnostic yield over time via meta -regression . Overall, an underlying genetic cause was found in a \nsubstantial proportion of the participants. The overall diagnostic yield of ES was determined to be 27.1% (95% CI, 18.1% -\n37.2%) , and the overall diagnostic yield of CMA was 13.6% (95% CI, 9.2% -18.7%). Neither the evaluation of diagnostic \nyield over time nor evaluation of diagnosti c yield related to whether testing was first -tier (27.8%; 95% CI, 15.7% -41.8%) or \nlast-resort (25.6%; 95% CI, 13.6% -39.6%) ( p = .83) revealed significant differences. The researchers concluded that these \nresults strongly support  the diagnostic efficacy of ES and CMA in individuals  with short stature and provide a strong base \nof reference for clinicians to leverage when making informed clinical decisions regarding the use of these two genetic test \ntypes , which can ultimately lead to more timely and accurate treatment for affected individuals . \n \nHayes published a Clinical Utility Evaluation (2023) addressing the use of genetic testing, including WES and WGS,  for \nindividuals with clinically diagnosed autism spectrum disorder  (ASD). Overall, Hayes found evidence from few very poor -\nquality studies supporting the use of genetic testing for in individuals  with this disorder . Although limited evidence \nindicates that results of genetic testing may lead to additional testing and treatment recommendations in a portion of \nindividuals tested, it is not clear if there are improved outcomes or any benefit in comparison with standard evaluation \nprotocols.  \n In a 2022 (updated 2023) Clinical Utility Evaluation, Hayes found insufficient evidence for use of WES or WGS to assist \nwith clinical decision -making and improve overall outcomes in adults with suspected neuromuscular disease or movement \ndisorders. Limited, very low -quality evidence was found  for WES;  larger prospective studies investigating impact on \nclinical management and outcomes are required.  For WGS, no studies investigating use in adults suspected to have \nneuromuscular or movement disorders were identified . Studies evaluating WGS data and its relationship to management \nand outcomes in individuals with these disorders are needed.  \n \nSánchez -Luquez et al. (2022) sought to estimate the rate of molecular diagnostic assessment of intellectual disability (ID) \nby WES, quantify the amount of de novo mutations (DNMs) that contribute to that rate,  and attempt to characterize the \ngenes related to the mutations found through WES  in their recent systematic review and meta- analysis . Studies published \nbetween 2010 and 2022 were searched and ultimately  37 articles with information on molecular diagnostic yield using \nWES for ID were included. The diagnostic rate for WES was found to be 42% (Confidence interval [CI]: 35– 50%), and the \nestimate related to DNMs only was 11% (CI: 6– 18%). The diagnostic yield was significantly greater when testing of both \nbiological parents was done or multiple affec ted family members were tested. The rate specific to DNMs supports the \nutility of WES for unex plained ID. The authors assert that the use of WES for molecular diagnosis of ID is supported by \nthe results of this review. Publications by Ewans et al. (2018)  and Bowling  et al.  (2017) , previously discussed in this \npolicy, were included in the Sánchez -Luquez systematic review.  \n \nCurrently, multiple different approaches may be used to genetically evaluate individuals with ID or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders (NDDs). In a retrospective analysis including individuals who had been referred for diagnostic genetic testing at \nKarolinska University Hospital in Stockholm Sweden, Lindstrand et al. (2022) examined the results of testing from three \ndifferent diagnostic methods in individuals with ID/NDD. In cohort 1, GS was used for first -line genetic evaluation (n = \n100). GS was used as second or third- line genetic testing (most commonly after CMA/FMR1 testing) when first -line testing \nwas unsuccessful in identifying a cause for the clinical phenotype in cohort 2 (n = 129). Finally, CMA (and FMR1 expansion testing in 50% of this group) was used i n 421 participants (cohort 3). Noted commonalities across the groups \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 8 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n were epilepsy and dysmorphic features. For cohort 1, using GS as a first -line test, diagnostic yield was 35%. When GS \nwas used as a secondary test (cohort 2), yield was 26% and when only CMA/FMR1 was performed (cohort 3), yield was \n11%. Of note, when GS wa s performed as a secondary test, age of diagnosis was delayed approximately one year , and \nfor those with a negative result after CMA/FMR1 testing (n = 338), no referral for additional genetic testing was made \n(after 13 months) and individuals remained undi agnosed. The authors conclude that this study’s findings support the use \nof genome evaluation over other testing strategies and should be used in place of CMA and FMR1 as a first -line test in \nindividuals with ID/NDD.  The findings are limited by lack of randomization and possible confounding factors.  \n \nIn a prospective study evaluating children with global developmental delay ( DD)/ID, Sun et al. (2022) sought to assess the \nperformance of GS for individuals whose CMA and ES results were inconclusive. One hundred children with global DD/ID \nwho had received at least one genomic diagnostic test prior to enrollment were recruited for th is study, which took place in \nChina. The researchers reanalyzed CMA and ES results, calculating yield of GS and seeking explanations for diagnoses \nthat were missed by CMA/ES. Th ey found the overall diagnostic yield of GS to be 21% and determined that diagnoses \ncould have been reached in seven cases with reanalysis of the ES data. Clinical utility was assessed via phone interview \nwith parents; of the diagnosed families, nine exper ienced changes in clinical management which included adding targeted \ntreatment, ending unnecessary treatment and consideration for family planning. The authors assert that use of GS led to high diagnostic yield and clinical utility for this study’s partici pants.  \n \nStranneheim et al. (2021) reported on the results of WGS for 4,437 individuals (3219 individuals and 1218 relatives) \ntested at the Genomic Medicine Center Karolinska- Rare Diseases (GMCK -RD) since mid -2015. Reporting included \nresults from both individual (84%) and trio/family testing (16%). In total, 40% of individuals tested received a molecular \ndiagnosis (ranging from 19% to 54% depending on specific disease groups). Common genes found to be causative \nincluded COL2A1 (skeletal dysplasia), SCN1A  (epilepsy) and TNFRSF13B  (inborn errors of immunity). Additionally, \nnegative cases went on to be included in further studies, resulting in the identification of 17 new disease- causing genes. \nThe use of WGS at GMCK -RD has resulted in diagnoses for over 1200 individuals with varying rare diseases. The \nauthors advocate for continued clinical and academic partnership to expand the use of clinical WGS and help individuals with rare diseases end their diagnostic odysseys and gain understanding of their prognosis and treatment options.  \n A Hayes Clinical Utility Evaluation (2021a, updated 2022) indicates uncertain clinical utility for WES  and insufficient \nclinical utility for WGS when these technologies are used to inform clinical action  and/or improve outcomes in children 18 \nyears or younger with neurological phenotypes for whom a diagnosis has not been determined after standard diagnostic \ntests. In the case of WES, included studies (n = 12) documented changes in treatment and improved outcomes in a small \nportion of individuals tested (2-22%). For WGS, o utcomes are from a small and narrowly defined population group \nfocused on infants with neurological phenotypes ; Hayes notes  that a dditional studies evaluating both larger numbers and \na broader range of children with neurological symptoms are required.  \n An additional Clinical Utility Evaluation (Hayes, 2021b, updated 2023) found insufficient evidence for utility of WES and \nWGS to guide clinical care in individuals with a primary phenotype of ID alone. This evaluation did  does not address  ID in \nindividuals with other disorders including NDD  or global DD , which are discussed in separate Hayes reports . No peer -\nreviewed studies were found that assessed clinical utility for individuals with a primary phenotype of ID.  \n \nTo compare the yield of genetic testing across both sequencing technologies  and subtypes of NDD , Stefanski et al. (2021) \nperformed a systematic review and meta- analysis of studies using next generation sequencing ( NGS ) for individuals with \nASD, epilepsy , and ID. After applying selection criteria, 103 studies (ASD n = 14, ID n = 21, epilepsy n = 72) including \nresults for 32,331 individuals were analyzed. In 36 study groups, ES was used and in 73 groups targeted gene panel \nsequencing was used. The diagnostic yield was 23.7% overall; for ASD, epilepsy and ID, yields were 17.1% 24% and 28.2%, respect ively. Authors note that the highest diagnostic yield for those with epilepsy was found in individuals with ID \nand early onset seizures. Although the diagnostic yield for ES was higher than for panel sequencing, the difference was not statically  significant (27.2% vs 22.6%, p = .071). Per these results, approximately 1/5\nth of individuals with NDD can \nreceive a molecular diagnosis using NGS. Further discussed  is a potential explanation for the lower diagnostic yield found \nin this review compared to previous studies . The researchers suggest that study composition may have played a role; th is \nsystematic review included three to four times the number of studies compared to other reviews done. I n addition, only \nstudies with a minimum of 20 participants were used,  increasing statistical accuracy , and this review included panel based \nstudies in addition to ES data. Limitations of this review include potential for underestimation of diagnostic yield related to \nthe use of standard genetic tests prior to NGS in some studies. Also, not all of the studies used ACMG classification \nguidelines for variants  and the studies consisted of a heterogeneous collection of methodologies for sample and data \ncollection. Lastly, generalizability to a global population is limited, as no studies from Africa, India or Latin America were \nincluded. Additional randomized controlled studies focused on evidence for the types of genetic testing that will best serve \nthe need of afflicted individuals are recommended. In spite of the limitations, this study is the largest meta- analysis \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 9 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n investigating diagnostic yield for NGS to date and provides comprehensive data regarding the use of NGS for NDD to \nassist with management of individuals with these disorders.  \n \nA small but growing body of evidence suggests that some cases of cerebral palsy may be attributable to rare genomic \nvariants including copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). To further investigate the \nmolecular diagnostic yield of ES in individuals with cerebral palsy , Moreno- De-Luca et al. (2021) conducted a \nretrospective cohort study. The study included 2 cohorts of 1526 participants total with cerebral pals y; 1345 were included \nin the cohort referred to as the clinical laborat ory referral cohort, and 181 were included in the cohort called the health \ncare-based cohort. The clinical laboratory referral cohort had a median age of 8.8 years,  and the health care -based cohort \nhad a median age of 41.9 years. In the clinical laboratory referral cohort  (predominantly pediatric) , molecular diagnostic \nyield of ES was 32.7% and in the health care- based cohort  (predominantly adult) , it was 10.5%. Pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were identified in 229 genes; 86 genes were mutated in 2 or more participants and 10 genes with \nmutations were found independently in both cohorts.  Noted limitations include the variation in capture reagents for \nsequencing, variability in clinical information available for each individual and the approach with which each cohort was \nascertained. Correlation between different types of cerebral palsy was not explored and the health care -based cohort did \nnot have parental samples to evaluate for variant inheritance since it was primarily made up of adult s. The authors note \nthat this was an observational study and that no causal relationship between detected gene variants and phenotypes were \nestablished. Further research is required to understand and apply the clinical implications of the findings.  \n \nIn a 2021 publication, Krantz et al. reported the results of their investigation of the effect of WGS on the impact of clinic al \nmanagement of infants admitted to an intensive care unit ( ICU) from 5 US children’s hospitals. Their multicenter \nrandomized trial incorporated a time- delayed study design and focused on selection of children whose providers \nsuspected genetic disorder. Usual care was continued through the study, capturing variation in management and helping \nwith the assessment of real -world clinical situations. A total of 354 infants were enrolled from September 2017 to April \n2019, with observation through July 2019. Infants between 0 and 120 days old were included (mean age = 15 days) . The \ninfants were randomized to receive WGS results either 15 days (early) or 60 days (delayed) after study enrollment. Infants were racially and ethnically diverse with a geographically distributed population in the US. The researchers indicated that \ntwice as many infants in the early group vs the delayed group received a change in management (COM) (34 of 161 vs. 17 \nof 165) and molecular diagnosis (55 of 176 vs 27 of 178) at 60 days. COM and diagnostic efficacy doubled in the delayed \ngroup at 90 days (to 45 of 161 and 56/178, respectively). The study , however,  showed no measurable difference in length \nof stay or survival. The authors concluded that comprehensive genomic testing of acute care infants can impact clinical management and that WGS specifically positively impacts patient care and should be considered for critically ill infants \nwith suspected genetic disease as a primary tool. Of note, this study was industry sponsored and conflicts of interest were \npresent which could have impacted choice of methods (in particular, outcomes), or the validity of the interpretation of the \nfindings. In addition, the findings may not be generalizable to ICUs outside of tertiary referral centers, which may have a \nlower incidence of genetic disease. The relevance of study findings on clinical outcomes is unclear and was not examined \nin this study.  \n \nIn a 2021 preliminary report, Smedley et al. shared results of their pilot study investigating the role of genome sequencing \nin individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases. The study included 2,183 families with a total of 4,660 participants who were recrui ted after having been identified by health care providers and researchers as having rare diseases that had not \nyet been diagnosed after receipt of standard care (including no diagnostic testing or approved diagnostic tests which did \nnot include genome sequencing) in the UK National Health Service. Among the participants, 161 disorders including a \nbroad array of rare diseases, was present. Data was collected on clinical features, genome sequencing was performed, \nand new pathogenic variants were identified through the analysis. The disease categories of participants being evaluated \nfor rare genetic conditions included: cardiovascular disorder, ciliopathy, dermatologic disorder, dysmorphic or congenital abnormality, endocrine disorder, gastroenterological disor der, growth disorder, hematologic or immunologic disorder, \nhearing or ear disorder, metabolic disorder, intellectual disability, neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder, ophthalmologic disorder, renal and urinary tract disorder, respiratory disorder, rheumatologic disorder, skeletal disorder, or \ntumor syndrome. The report indicates that diagnostic yields were highest in families with larger pedigrees and were higher \nfor disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders with a complex cause (11%). Fourteen percent of \ndiagnoses were made using a combination of automated approaches and research which was especially important for \ncases with etiologic noncoding, structural,  and mitochondrial genome variants as well as variants which were not well \ncovered by ES. In the course of the study, 3 new disease genes and 19 new associations were discovered. Ultimately, \n25% of diagnoses that were made had immediate implications for cl inical decision- making for affected individuals and \ntheir families. The  researchers concluded that study showed an increase in diagnostic yield for rare diseases when \ngenome sequencing was used and supports the case for using genomic sequencing when diagnosing certain specific rare \ndiseases. However, the study did not include a comparison group and the relevance of the study findings on clinical \noutcome is only documented in the publication with anecdotal reports.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 10 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Malinowski et al. (2020) reported on the outcome of an American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics ( ACMG ) \nsystematic review performed to assist with creation of an evidence- based guideline addressing the use of ES and GS . \nThis ACMG practice guideline is included in the Clinical Practice Guidelines section of this policy . Primary literature \nincluding health, clinical, reproductive,  and psychosocial outcomes resulting from ES/GS in individuals with CA/DD/ID was \nidentified. Ultimately, 167 articles were included; these were largely case reports or small case series and of note, all but \none study lacked a comparison group. Changes to clinical management or reproductive decision- making were the most \nfrequently reported outcomes and were observed in nearly all included studies. Further, a significant number of the \narticles reported clinical impact on family members of the affected individual or an impact on reproductive outcomes. The \nauthors concluded that for individuals with CA/DD/ID, ES and GS assists with clinical and reproductive decision -making, \npotentially improving outcomes for affected individuals and family members. However, there were some noted conflicts of \ninterest and the relevance of these findings on clinical outcomes is not clear. Studies by S tark et al. (2016), Tarailo-\nGraovac et. al . (2016) , Tan et al. (2017), Vissers et al. (2017), Cordoba et al. (2018), Petrikin et al. (2018), Powis et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018) and French et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy , were includ ed in th e Malinowsk i et \nal. systematic review.  \n \nA large study of WGS was performed by Turro et al. (2020) in individuals who had rare diseases. The researchers aimed \nto use WGS in 83 national health systems and hospitals (UK and other countries) and had 13,037 participants. The \nparticipants ranged in age (from birth to 95 years of age), race, gender, and disorders. Of all participants, 9,802 had a rare \ndisease and 9,024 were probands; 778 were affected relatives. A genetic diagnosis was defined for 1,138 of the 7,065 \nparticipants that were extensively phenotyped. The study identified 95 Mendelian associations between genes and rare diseases.  \n While following the ACMG guidelines to assess variant pathogenicity, Hou et al. (2020) conducted a prospective cohort study combining deep phenotyping with WGS. Participants were adults (n = 1,190) who consented to WGS and agreed to \nparticipate in metabolo mics, clinical laboratory testing, advanced imaging and provide family/medical history. Phenotypic \nresults were, subsequently, integrated with genomic results. Positive pathogenic findings suggesting a genetic risk \npredisposition, were found in 17.3% of adults. When genetic results were incorporated with deep phenotyping, 11% had \nobserved genotype/phenotype correlations. Greater than 75% of these correlations included risk for dyslipidemia (n = 24), \ncardiomyopathy, arrhythmia/other cardiac conditions (n = 42) and endocrine/diabetic conditions (n = 17). Approximately 6% of participants with pathogenic variants did not have a genotype/phenotype correlation. Hou et al. concluded that \nresults of this study and future studies can provide beneficial information to aid in precision medical practice. The authors \nindicated that this study did not measure health outcomes or benefits. Repeat evaluation of these individuals is required to \ncharacterize the clinical significance of the findings.  \n \nHu et al. (2020)  examined 60 pediatric patients from Beijing Children’s Hospital suspected of having a genetic disorder \nincluding multiple congenital anomalies (MCA, n = 25), ASD (n = 4), DD/ID (n = 10), a combination of DD/ID and multiple \ncongenital disorders (n = 6) and 15 with other phenotypes (e.g., congenital heart disease, short stature, recurrent \ninfections).  Trio WES and CNV sequencing was performed to identify the diagnostic yield and clinical utility of parallel \ntesting . A total of 37 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were found in 32 individuals (26 SNV s; 11 CNV s). Of the SNVs \nidentified, 65.4% were novel. Overall, the diagnosis rate was 53.3% . For the individuals that had positive results, 36.7% \nand 16.7% of positive results were diagnosed by WES and CNV, respectively. The diagnosis rates for individuals with \nDD/ID and/or MCA were greater than 50%. In addition to obtaining increased diagnosis rates for their c ohort compared to \ntraditional trio WES (36.7 to 53.3%) the authors concluded that they also achieved their secondary objectives of \ndecreasing overall turnaround time by performing parallel testing (median 72 days) and helping physicians make easier \nchoices  about optimal testing regarding WES and CNV sequencing.  \n \nIn a 2019 scoping review by the Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) Exome Scoping Review Work Group, Srivastava et \nal. (included in the Hayes 2021a and 2022 Clinical Utility Evaluation s) addressed ES  for use in individuals  with NDDs. The \nstudy included a meta- analysis  and subsequent consensus statement and the objective was to compare yield of ES with \nthat of  CMA in affected individuals . The study defined NDD as global DD, ID, and/or ASD. A total of 30 articles addressing \ndiagnostic yield in individuals with either NDD or NDD with associated conditions were analyzed. The yield of ES was \n36% overall (31% for isolated NDD and 53% for NDD with associated conditions ), which is substantially greater than \nprevious studies focused on CMA (15 -20%). The researchers  conclude that the study showed consistent ly better  \nperformance of ES over CMA for evaluation of unexplained NDDs and recommend that ES should be used as a first -tier \ntest. Noted limitations include focus on ID and/or ASD with potential exclusion of articles where phenotypes may have \nbeen less specific. Several of the included studies did not clearly define basis of ASD or ID/global DD, and certain studies \nwith heterogeneou s cohorts where number of individuals with NDD could not be determine were excluded, as well as \nstudies including mtDNA sequencing. Publications by Vissers et al. (2017 ), Tarailo- Graovac et al. (2016), Retterer et al. \n(2016) , and Lee et al. (2014), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Srivastava systematic review and \nmeta -analysis.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 11 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Groopman et al. (2019) studied the utility of WES in 3, 315 patients from two independent study cohorts with chronic \nkidney disease. A Study to Evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in Subjects on Regular Hemodialysis: An Assessment of \nSurvival and Cardiovascular Events (AURORA) contributed 1, 128 patients, and 2, 773 patients came from a Columbia \nUniversity Medical Center (CUMC) on end- stage renal disease who were recruited from 280 medical centers in 25 \nnations. For patients in the AURORA cohort, only broad categories and diagnostic codes for major clinical features were \navailable, and detail clinical information from the EHR was available for the CUMC cohort. Most participants were over 21 years of age (92%) and of European ancestry (65%). WES provided a diagnost ic result in 307 (9.3%) patients of 66 \ndifferent genetic disorders. Diagnoses were found in all clinical categories, including congenital or cystic disease, and \nidiopathic nephropathies. Of those with a genetic diagnosis, 34 patients (1.6%) had medically actionable findings that \nincluded a change in renal management or referral to a subspecialty clinic.  \n \nThe use of WES in the diagnostic workup of individuals with an idiopathic bleeding tendency was studied by Saes et al. \n(2019). A total of 87 patients at a mean age of 41 with a bleeding diathesis were analyzed using the Tosetto BAT score \nand standard diagnostic tests and divided into three groups: increased BAT with normal lab results (Group A), abnormal \nplatelet count (Group B), or abnormal lab results without a definitive diagnosis (Group C). Patients  were counseled by a \nclinical geneticist and consented to either a bleeding disorder gene panel only, or WES. All patients underwent WES, and for the targeted panel group, an in- silico panel was applied to select only known thrombosis and hemostasis genes.  In the \ntarget panel analysis, fifteen patients (17%) were found to have a pathogenic variant in the targeted panel. Group A had \nthe highest incidence of cases solved (24%), Group B had a 5% diagnostic yield, and Group C came in at 4%. Exome \nanalysis was performed in 54 of the 80 unsolved cases. WES identified three VUS in candidate genes.  The impact of this \napproach on patient outcomes , however, is unclear.  \n The BabySeq project is a pilot randomized trial within the Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT) study. NSIGHT is an NIH- funded consortium of four research programs designed to address questions and \nconcerns about implementing r outine WES into newborn care. Ceyhan- Birsoy et al. (2019) reports on their experience \nwith the first 159 newborns analyzed in the BabySeq project, of which 127 were healthy newborns and 32 were ill and in the NICU. Fifteen newborns (ten healthy, five from the NICU) were found to be at risk for childhood onset diseases, none \nof which were anticipated from the known clinical or family histories. Five of these were in genes with a high penetrance rate, and included non- syndromic hearing loss, glomuvenous malfo rmations, KBG syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and \ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21- hydroxylase deficiency. Eleven genetic variants found in this sub -group were \nassociated with moderate penetrance genetic disorders and were disclosed because of the possibility of early intervention. Examples included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, atypical hemolytic -uremic syndrome, type I \ncystinuria and G6PD deficiency. Eighty -five newborns were found to have risks for adult -onset diseases, such as BRCA \nrelated cancer or Lynch syndrome. Only three newborns’ parents chose to learn about the adult -onset disease risks. One \nhundred and forty of the newborns were found to be carriers of at least one autosomal recessive disorder. \nPharmacogenetic test resul ts were also returned and were limited to three genes felt by the BabySeq project to have the \nhighest level of evidence for informing drug prescribing in the pediatric population; DPYD, TPMT and G6PD. Eight \nnewborns had variants in these genes that could i mpact future care should the need for fluoropyrimidines or thiopurines \narise. The infant with G6PD Deficiency was reported in the childhood onset disease section, as symptoms can be triggered by factors other than medications. Testing of parents was requir ed and helpful in resolving results in thirteen \ncases. The authors concluded that this pilot study suggests that newborn WES may provide useful information beyond \nthat currently available with routine newborn screening.  The clinical utility of this approach is, however, unclear.  \n \nIn order to analyze the application of WES and WGS as a routine diagnostic tool for patients, Smith et al. (2019) \nundertook a scoping review of the literature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta -\nanalysis (PRISMA) method of reporting observational studies. The timeframe from which they drew from the literature was \n2009 to 2017, and they focused on diagnostic WES or WGS for infant and pediatric patients. A total of 171 articles were found, of which 131 were case reports, 40 were aggregate analysis and 4 were focused on a cost -effectiveness objective. \nThe only metric consistently reported across all studies was diagnostic yield, and that varied broadly by clinical category \nand test type. In aggregate it was 33.2%. The authors  concluded that multi -disciplinary research that focuses on \nconsistency in outcome measurement is needed to demonstrate clinical utility.  \n \nAs part of the North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next -Generation Exome Sequencing Study (NCGENES), \nHaskell et al. (2018) used WES to determine a genetic diagnosis in 93 patients with NMD. Patients were categorized into \nthree groups based on cli nical findings: primarily neuropathy, primarily myopathy, or complex. After DNA extraction and \nWES, variants were filtered through three different gene lists in order to compare diagnostic yield between different lists. A \nneuropathy list of 199 genes impli cated in neuropathy phenotypes, a myopathy list of 181 genes, and a list of 482 genes \nimplicated in NMD were used. Variants were then categorized using the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics (ACMG) standards on pathogenicity. The overall diagnostic yield of WES for pathogenic or likely pathogenetic \nvariants was 12.9%, and each gene list gave a different diagnostic yield. In some cases, family testing was performed to \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 12 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n determine gene segregation and verify pathogenicity. The authors found that in patients with a clear neuropathy or \nmyopathy, WES had the same diagnostic yield as the broader diagnostic test list. In patients with a complex phenotype, \nthe broader list had t he best diagnostic yield (9%) when compared to the neuropathy (4.9%) or myopathy (0%) diagnostic \nlists. Many of these patients had undergone muscle biopsy (42%), nerve conduction studies or electromyograms (86%), \nand genetic testing previously (68% overall  and 20% had a multi -gene panel) and a definitive diagnosis had not been \nreached. The participant’s biopsy, electrodiagnostic testing, and prior genetic results were reviewed by three independent \nspecialist reviewers who categorized the testing as informat ive or non- informative in the context of WES results. Sixty -\nthree percent of the prior testing was considered informative, meaning that it correlated with the pathogenic variant \nidentified in WES as a neuropathy, myopathy, or a complex disorder. In two cas es, WES identified molecular diagnoses \nthat directly impacted medical treatment. One patient had been clinically diagnosed with a chronic inflammatory \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, but WES demonstrated that the genetic diagnosis of Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix -\nSaguenay, so unnecessary immunotherapy was avoided. The second patient had been thought to have a hereditary \nspastic paraplegia, but the genetic diagnosis was confirmed as a form of dopa- responsive dystonia, and after dopa \ntherapy was started, she regained the ability to walk without assistance. The authors concluded that introducing genome-\nscale sequencing into the clinical workflow earlier may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, minimize invasive testing, and \nprovide potential opportunities for clinical and investigational therapeutics for patients with NMD.  \n \nBardakjian et al. (2018) studied adult patients with neurological disorders who had been recommended to have genetic \ntesting to determine the diagnostic yield of, and patient interest in, different types of tests in a real -world clinical setting. All \npatients were seen at a university -based specialty or neurogenetics clinic between January 2016 and April 2017 and were \nidentified retrospectively through the electronic medical system. Overall, 377 patients were evaluated. The primary clinical indications for diagnostic genetic testing included ataxia, epilepsy, hereditary spastic paraparesis, leukodystrophy, \nmemory loss, movement disorders, neuromuscular disease, and predictive testing due to a family history of disease, such \nas Huntington Disease. Genetic tes ting recommendations took place in a specialty clinic for 182 patients and 195 in the \nneurogenetics clinic. Eighty percent of patients had genetic testing completed. For those who chose not to have testing, \n71 declined testing after genetic counseling, and 3 wanted to have testing, but it was not performed due to lack of \ninsurance coverage. The highest rate of choosing not to test was in the category of patients referred for predictive testing \nfor Huntington Disease. Age was not found to be a factor in accepting or declining testing. The overall diagnostic rate was \n32% in the 303 people who completed testing. The yield was highest (50%) in targeted testing, where one or two genes were selected for testing based on clinical findings (n = 89). This category is  followed by array comparative genome \nhybridization (aCGH) (45%) in 7 patients, followed by multigene panels (25%) in 155 patients, and exome testing (25%) in 52 patients. The authors reported that for individuals being worked up for dystonia, the use of a panel test reduced the \ntime to diagnosis by 75%. In addition, the use of panel tests and WES increased the number of variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS). Using family segregation testing, de- identified genetic data- sharing through commercial platform s or \nacademic consortia, the authors reduced the number of reportable VUS by one third but acknowledged this required the \ninvolvement of an expert clinician with the training and knowledge to resolve VUS.  \n \nClark et al. (2018) conducted a meta- analysis comparing the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and chromosome \nmicroarray (CMA) in children suspected of having genetic disease. Analysis of the literature from January 2011 to August 2017 was conduct ed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta- analysis (PRISMA) and \nMeta ‐analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Thirty -seven studies of 20,068 children \nwere included. Overall, the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS was greater than CMA. In studies from only 2017, the \ndiagnostic utility of WGS was greater than CMA. Among studies featuring in cohort comparisons, the diagnostic utility of \nWES was greater than CMA. The diagnostic utility between WG S and WES was not significantly different. In studies with \nin-cohort comparisons of WGS and WES, there was a greater chance of achieving a diagnosis when a trio was available \nthan singleton testing, and with in- hospital interpretation versus a reference la b interpretation. In this study, clinical utility \nwas defined as a change in clinical management. Cases where the only change was reproductive planning or a change in \ngenetic counseling were excluded. The clinical utility of WES was greater, but not statis tically significant, than CMA. \nHowever, WGS was higher for clinical utility than CMA, and met statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The authors identified \nseveral limitations with the meta- analysis, such as the heterogeneity of the pooled data, taking diagnostic rates at face \nvalue, and that only one study met the highest level of evidence criteria for clinical interventions. Overall, they concluded \nthat more randomized, well designed and controlled clinical studies are needed but WES and WGS could be cons idered \nover CMA for a first -tier test in a child suspected of having a genetic diagnosis.  \n The diagnostic utility of WES in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was evaluated by Lata et al. (2018). Ninety -two \nindividuals who were referred for analysis and workup due to CKD of unknown etiology or due to familial nephropathy or \nhypertension underwent WES. Overall a diagnosis was found in 24% of patients, including in 9 patients with CKD of \nunknown etiology. One BRCA2 mutation was found as an incidental finding, and the individual was diagnosed with breast \ncancer in a follow up appointment. Clinical management was altered in patients with a positive result and included a change in targeted surveillance, initiation of family screening to guide transplant donor selection, and changes in therapy.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 13 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Splinter et al. (2018) reported on the findings of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) which reported a diagnostic \nyield of 13% for WGS in persons that had undergone prior genetic testing, including WES, with no diagnosis. Patients (n = \n601) that were accepted by the UDN were evaluated by WGS (192 had previously had WES). The majority of clinical \nphenotypes included 40% neurological, 10% musculoskeletal, 7% immunologic, 7% gastrointestinal and 6% \nrheumatologic. Complete evaluation was performed in 382/60 1, and WGS provided a result in 132 patients (35% \ndiagnostic yield). Eleven percent (15 cases) of diagnoses were made solely by clinical review; 11% were made by \ndirected clinical testing; 4% were made by non -sequencing genetic testing; 74% were made by WG S. Twenty -eight \npercent (55/195) of patients, who had WES performed, received a diagnosis; 32/165 (19%) of patients having WGS \nrevealed a diagnosis. Seventeen of these patients (53%) had previously undergone unsuccessful WES testing prior to \nreferral to UD N. Thirty -one new syndromes were revealed. Twenty -one percent of the diagnosis resulted in \nrecommendations in therapy changes, 37% resulted in changes to diagnostic testing and 36% led to genetic counseling \nfor variant discussion.  \n Another study that reviewed the utility of WES and WGS was conducted by Carss et al. (2017). The authors studied a cohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease (IRD) who had WES (n = 72), WGS (n = 605) or both (n = 45) as \npart of the NIHR -BioResource Rare Diseases research study. The diagnoses included in the cohort included retinitis \npigmentosa (n = 311), retinal dystrophy (n = 101), cone- rod dystrophy (n = 53), Stargardt disease (n = 45), macular \ndystrophy (n = 37), and Usher syndrome (n = 37) . In the 117 individuals who had WES, 59 (50%) had pathogenic variants \nidentified. Forty -five individuals with a negative WES had subsequent WGS, and an additional 14 pathogenic variants \nwere found. In three of these, the variant location was absent from t he WES hybrid capture kit. Three individuals had large \nCNVs  that could not be called by WES, and three others had variants that were found in the WES results, but the quality \nwas poor, and they were not called. In the remaining 5 individuals, the variants were also found in WES, but the mode of \ninheritance was unexpected, so WGS was used to exclude other possible causes of the disease. The detection rate \nvaried by phenotype, ranging from 84% in individuals with Usher syndrome to 29% in those with cone dystr ophy. Ethnicity \nalso impacted the detection rate. Only 30% of individuals with African ancestry had cases solved, compared to 55% of \nEuropean ancestry or 57% of South Asian ancestry. The authors further reviewed benefits of WGS. They noted that 3 individuals had pathogenic, non- coding variants that would not be detected by WES. They compared the IRD genes that \nwere high or low in GC content in their WGS data set to the same genes in the WES ExAC database and concluded that the WGS dataset had consistent cov erage whereas the WES data did not. They also noted that in their data set, WGS \nwas better at detecting synonymous variants and variants in regulatory regions compared to WES. Overall, the detection \nrate for WGS was 56% in this cohort. Factors that may inf luence this study compared to others is the technology used, \nphenotype screening and phenotypes used. They observed that the subset of people tested who had no prescreening had \na higher pathogenic call rate, suggesting that the cohort may have been enriche d for difficult cases, and the detection rate \nfor WGS could be higher if used as a first line test. The authors noted that their WES coverage rate was 43X, compared to \nthe > 80X recommended for a commercial lab, and that might have influenced the results.  \n \nTrujillano et al. (2017) reported on the results of WES performed on 1000 consecutive cases with suspected Mendelian \ndisorders from 54 countries (78.5% Middle East, 10.6% Europe, and 10.9% from rest of the world)  referred for diagnostic \nWES between January 2014 and January 2016. Patients ranged between 1 month and 59 years, 92.4% were 15 years or younger, with 14.1% younger than 1 year and 39.4% 1 - 5 years of age. The cohort also included 23 prenatal cases \n(2.3%). Notably, 45.3% of the cases were from cons anguineous families and 38.1% presented family history of the \ndisease. Most cases (82.7%) were analyzed with a trio design (parents and index). They identi fied pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in 307 families (30.7%). In further 253 families (25.3%) a variant of unknown signi ficance, possibly \nexplaining the clinical symptoms of the index patient was identi fied. WES enabled timely diagnosing of genetic diseases, \nvalidation of causality of speci fic genetic disorders of PTPN23 , KCTD3 , SCN3A , PPOX, FRMP D4, and SCN1B , and \nsetting dual diagnoses by detecting two causative variants in distinct genes in the same patient. There was a better diagnostic yield in consanguineous families, in severe and in syndromic phenotypes. Based on these results, the authors \nrecommend WES  as a first-line diagnostic in all cases without a clear differential diagnosis.  \n \nYang et al. (2014) performed clinical WES  and reported (1) the rate of molecular diagnosis among phenotypic groups, (2) \nthe spectrum of genetic alterations contributing to disease, and (3) the prevalence of medically actionable incidental \nfindings such as FBN1 mutations causing Marfan syndrome. T his was an observational study of 2000 consecutive \npatients with clinical WES analyzed between June 2012 and August 2014. WES tests were performed at a clinical genetics’  laboratory in the United States. Results wer e reported by clinical molecular geneticists certified by the American \nBoard of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Tests were ordered by the patient's physician. The patients were primarily \npediatric (1756 [88%]; mean age, 6 years; 888 females [44%], 1101 males [55%], and 11 fetuses [1% gender unknown]), \ndemonstrating diverse clinical manifestations most often including nervous system dysfunction such as developmental \ndelay. A molecular diagnosis was reported for 504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously \nreported. Molecular diagnosis rates for each phenotypic category were 143/526 for the neurological group, 282/1147 for \nthe neurological plus other organ systems group, 30/83 for the specific neurological group, and 49/244 for the non -\n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 14 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare.

The Mendelian disease patterns of the 527 molecular diagnoses included 280 (53.1%) autosomal \ndominant, 181 (34.3%) autosomal recessives  (including 5 with uniparental disomy), 65 (12.3%) X -linked, and 1 (0.2%) \nmitochondrial. Of 504 patients with a molecular diagnosis, 23 (4.6%) had blended phenotypes resulting from 2 single gene \ndefects. About 30% of the positive cases harbored mutations i n disease genes reported since 2011. There were 95 \nmedically actionable incidental findings in genes unrelated to the phenotype but with immediate implications for \nmanagement in 92 patients (4.6%), including 59 patients (3%) with mutations in genes recommended for reporting by the \nACMG . The authors concluded that WES provided a potential molecular diagnosis for 25% of a large cohort of patients \nreferred for evaluation of suspected genetic conditions, including detection of rare genetic events and new mutations \ncontributing to disease. A ccording to the authors, the yield of WES may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients.  \n \nPrenatal  Genetic Diagnosis or Screening \nA 2023 systematic review and meta -analysis by Shreeve et al. sought to determine the incremental yield of WGS over \nWES and/or CMA in fetuses and infants with an anomaly that either was or could have been detected via ultrasound in \nthe prenatal period. Secondary outcomes included the assessment of turnaround time and quantity of DNA required for \nthese tests. A total of 18 studies comprising 1,284 individual cases met inclusion criteria for the study. Eight studies (754 \ncases) were prenatal cohorts and the re maining ten studies included postmortem, neonatal, or infants demonstrating \ncongenital structural abnormalities. The incremental yield of WGS over WES (1%) was not significant (95% CI 0% -4%, I2 \n= 4 7%). Yield of WGS over quantitative fluorescence- polymerase chain reaction (QF -PCR)/CMA was 26% for all (95% CI \n18-36%, I2 =  86%), 16% for prenatal (9 -24%, I2 =  85%), and 39% (95%CI 27 -51%, I2 =  53%)for postnatal cases. Pooled \nmedian turnaround time for WGS was 18 days; only one study documented turnaround time f or CMA/ WES, so no \ncomparison could be made. The study found a significant incremental yield with use of WGS compared to CMA for the \ngenetic evaluation of congenital anomalies, but no significant increase in incremental diagnostic yield of WGS over WES. \nThe authors note that there is currently insufficient evidence to promote the use of WGS over CMA and WES, but the use \nof WGS over standard pathways of testing uses less DNA and has the potential for faster turnaround times. Additional \nstudies are recommended. Public ations  by French et al. (2019), Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), and Petrikin et al. (2018), \npreviously discussed in this policy, were included in the Shreeve systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n \nIn a study  assessing the diagnostic yield of prenatal genetic testing using trio WES and WGS compared to standard CMA, \nMiceikaite et al. (2023) found a 25% increase in diagnostic yield when trio WES/WGS was performed in pregnancies where CMA had been negative. Testi ng took place between the 12\nth and 21st week of gestation, and all pregnancies \nincluded (n = 40) had documented fetal anomalies or increased nuchal translucency (≥  5 mm) . For each pregnancy, trio \nWES or WGS and standard CMA were performed. Of the 40 total pregnancies, 16 were found to have a genetic sequence \nvariation, CNV or aneuploidy which corresponded with the fetal phenotype; the overall diagnostic yield of WES/WGS was 40%. A total of six chromosomal abnormalities were detected via CMA and each of these was also identified by \nWES/WGS. An important finding was that WES testing yielded more consistent identification of mosaic sequence \nvariations than WGS , related to the ability of WES to sequence more deeply . The researchers assert that  although this \nstudy is limited by small sample size,  the results bolster the existing evidence supporting higher diagnostic yield of \nWES/WGS over CMA and speculate that WES/WGS testing has  promise for use as valuable, standalone testing for \nprenatal diagnostic use. \n \nMellis et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta- analysis to establish the diagnostic yield of ES when used for \nprenatal diagnosis of fetal structural anomalies after CMA is normal. The authors assessed 148 articles; 72 reports from \n66 studies were included in this review , representing a total of 4,350 fetuses. Incremental diagnostic yield of ES over \nCMA/karyotyping was analyzed via meta- analysis as well as effects of case selection and impact on diagnostic yield by \nfetal phenotype. Pooled increm ental yield of ES was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI] 26% -36%, p < 0.0001). The \ndiagnostic yield was significantly different between phenotypic sub- groups ranging from 2% for isolated increased nuchal \ntranslucency to 53% for isolated skeletal abnormalities and was substantially higher for cases that had been pre -selected \nfor likelihood of monogenic etiology as compared to unselected cases (42% vs. 15%, p < 0.0001). Based on these results, \nthe researchers concluded that prenatal ES is able to provide a diagnosis in an additional 31% of fetuses with structural abnormalities after CMA and karyotyping has not provided  a diagnosis. The diagnostic yield differs depending on the body \nsystem impacted and can be increased by specific pre -selection of cas es after a multi -disciplinary review indicating \nlikelihood of a monogenic  cause. This review was limited by the high level of heterogeneity between the studies that were \nevaluated, impacting the level of comparison achievable. There was also variation in sample sizes and the method of \nanalysis which likely impact diagnostic yield.  Noted is the need for ongoing research on the clinical impact of prenatal ES \nto gain understanding regarding which pregnancies will benefit most and how to appropriately prioritiz e cases for testing \nand the challenges that exist for interpreting variants with incomplete and/or nonspecific information regarding phenotype.  \nPublications by Chen et al.

(2018), previously discussed in this policy,  were included in this systematic review.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 15 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n WES of the fetus and biological parents (trio testing) was used to analyze 500 pregnancies between the 11th and 31st \nweek of gestation where abnormalities had been identified on fetal ultrasound (Gabriel et al. 2022). In most of the cases, \nnegative non- invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) rapid testing or chorionic short -\ntime culture were  obtained prior to exome analysis.  After excluding maternal cell contamination, remaining variants were \nclassified  as per ACMG criteria and medically evaluated. In 37.8% of cases, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were \nidentified that were determined to be causative to the fetal anomaly. This is comparable to the findings in postnatal trio \nexome studies. In 47.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, a heterozygous de novo variant  was the cause of the anomaly and in \n29.1% of the diagnosed fetuses, autosomal recessive diseases were identified. The average time to receive results was \n17.8 days after the lab received the sample, although time to results decreased as the study progress ed. The authors  \npoint out the large heterogeneity of the findings (pathogenic variants in 127 different genes) which highlights the \nimportance of comprehensive exome diagnostics over panel diagnostics  in fetal ultrasound anomalies. They assert that \ntrio ES can be a useful tool in prenatal diagnostics but stress the importance of comprehensive, interdisciplinary \ncounseling in conjunction with testing. Further high- quality studies using prenatal trio WES will be needed to establish \nclinical utility.  \n \nTo further investigate the relationship of multisystem anomalies and the use of ES, Pauta et al. (2022) conducted a \nsystematic review to ascertain the incremental diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with multisystem structural anomalies (at \nleast two in diff erent anatomical systems) and negative CMA or karyotyping result. A total of 17 articles with data on ES \ndiagnostic yield met inclusion criteria and were evaluated for this review including 694 fetuses with multisystem \nmalformations. Subgroup analysis compared the diagnostic yield of the solo approach (fetus alone tested) and the trio \napproach (fetus and both biological parents tested). In 213 fetuses, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found \nthat was potentially responsible for the fetal phenoty pe, representing an incremental yield of 33% (95% CI, 27- 40%) for \nES. Further assessment resulted in similar diagnostic yields of ES using either the solo approach (30%) or the trio \napproach (35%). Based on the results of this review, the authors conclude that potentially causative genes were identified \nwhen CMA or karyotyping was unsuccessful in approximately 1/3 of cases, with no meaningful differences between solo \nand trio approaches.  \n \nIn a 2021 systematic review and meta -analysis, Pauta et al. sought to determine the diagnostic yield of ES in fetuses with \nrecurrent fetal structural anomalies (where similar anomalies were found in consecutive pregnancies)  with normal results \nof microarray and no family disease identified. The researchers pinpointed nine studies on diagnostic yield of ES including \n140 fetuses with recurrent structural anomalies. Variants (either pathogenic or likely pathogenic) were found in 57 of the \nfetuses, representing in an incremental diagnostic yiel d of 40% when using ES (95%CI: 26% to 54%). A recessive \ninheritance pattern was found in the majority of diseases identified (86%) and of these,  42% of variants were \nhomozygous . Noted was that higher diagnostic yields appear to be associated with multisystem anomalies, as more than \nhalf the of positive results were in those fetuses with multisystem anomalies. The authors concluded that there is strong \nevidence that ES can be a powerful tool to uncover etiology of recurrent fetal malformations, especially monogenic \nsyndr omes, and they speculate that expansion from ES to GS will happen soon. A 2020 (updated 202 3) Hayes Clinical \nUtility Evaluation found that the evidence supporting WES and WGS  related to improvement of diagnosis and assist ance \nwith pregnancy and post -pregnancy management when abnormalities are detected by ultrasound or other testing is \nlacking. Large studies including outcome data and impact on clinical management are required to support clinical utility for \nthe use of WES and WGS in the prenatal setting.  \n \nReanalysis  \nThe Undiagnosed Rare Disease Program of Catalonia (URD -Cat) project (Bullich et al., 2022) systematically reanalyzed \ndata including genomic panels, ES and GS along with standardized phenotypes from 543 individuals in 323 families with \nundiagnosed neurologic diseases. Specifically , relatedness, consanguinity, runs of homozygosity, single- nucleotide \nvariants, insertions,  and deletions  and CNVs  were reinvestigated in the existing data. Collaborative interpretation was \nperformed using a customized Genome- Phenom e Analysis Platform  (GPAP) . This reanalysis resulted in a diagnosis for \n20.7% of individuals , 1.8% of whom were diagnosed after the generation of additional genomic data used to pinpoint a \nsecond pathogenic heterozygous variant. The study results indicated a significantly higher diagnostic rate for family -based \nexome and genome reanalysis when compared with individual panels . Recent gene- disease associations were \nresponsible for the majority of new diagnoses (50.8%). Other factors responsible for ability to reach a diagnosis were \nadditional/improved bioinformatic analysis (19.7%) and standardized phenotyping data in the platf orm used (18%). \nOverall, this reanalysis led to a diagnosis in 67 individuals , which, according to their referring clinicians, would enable \naffected individuals to receive better medical management, enable genetic counseling for parents/family members, and to \nlead to potential diagnoses in other affected family members. The authors conclude that use of the GPAP tool was key to \nefficient reanalysis of genomic information and data sharing.  \n \nIn an effort to determine the efficiency of distinct strategies for reanalysis of negative ES reports in undiagnosed children \nwith neurological conditions, Schobers et al. (2022) executed a systematic study. The study included 103 genetically \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 16 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n undiagnosed children who underwent reanalysis, including ES resequencing, five years after initial negative ES results. \nThe rate of physician- initiated routine re -evaluation was also monitored as part of the study. Of the 103 individuals \nincluded, physicians requested reevaluation for 45, which led to a total of 18 diagnoses (diagnostic yield of 31%). The \nstudy’s systematic reevaluation then identified another 14 diagnoses (total diagnostic yield 53%). The new diagnoses \nwere uncovered through the use of bet ter bioinformatic pipelines , improved coverage after resequencing, reclassification \nof previously identified variants and new gene- disease associations. Notably, 11 of the 14 genetic diagnoses found via the \nsystematic reevaluation were in children who did not recontact the referring physician. The authors conclude that both \nresequencing strategies as well as reanalysis of existing ES data are valuable in identifying additional genetic diagnoses. \nThe study showed that not  all afflicted individuals  will under go routine reevaluation, prolonging their diagnostic odyssey , \nunless a systematic reanalysis of negative results becomes standard.  \n \nTan et al. (2020) performed an evaluation of the systematic reanalysis of ES for undiagnosed individuals and a literature \nreview of studies that examined the reanalysis of ES data for cases in which a diagnosis was not found on initial ES. Data \nfrom 58 undiagnosed individuals was analyzed at 4- 13 months post initial results, including evaluation of genes that had \nbeen newly linked with disease since the first analysis. A second reanalysis was performed 9- 18 months after initial \ntesting  and considered all di sease -related genes. Finally, at 25- 34 months, all cases were reviewed with a comparison \nperformed of the strategies used to identify a diagnosis. The study found that reanalysis of the existing ES data only (at \ntwo points in time) did not yield any new diagnoses , however the use of additional strategies such as repeat sequencing, \ntrio sequencing and microarray detection of copy number variation led to 10 new diagnoses (17%) in this cohort. The literature review identified 27 peer -reviewed articles; median rate of new diagnosis subsequent to reanalysis was 15% and \nmedian time to reanalysis was 22 months. Based on their study and review, the researchers suggest an interval of at least \n18 months from the time of initial ES may be optimal, using diverse strategies for individuals who remain undiagnosed \nafter individual ES.  \n \nNambot et al. (2018) reported on the effectiveness of regularly re- analyzing WES over a period of three years to address \nongoing advances in bioinformatics approaches and updates to the medical literature. In a retrospective approach, the \nauthors re- examin ed 416 WES tests that had been conducted in their clinic between June 2013 and June 2016. In the \ninitial testing phase, 104 tests resulted in a diagnosis giving a diagnostic yield of 25%. There were 156 tests in the first two \nyears of the study that did not provide a diagnosis or conclusive results and were reanalyzed. From this cohort, 24 new diagnoses were made with a yield of 15%. Half of the new diagnosis resulted from new information appearing in the \nliterature, and bioinformatic pipeline updates resul ting in reconsideration of misclassified variants and an improved ability \nto detect CNVs . The other cases were resolved through collaboration with data sharing consortiums like the Matchmaker \nExchange project, which uses case data to help researchers ident ify patients carrying variants in the same gene. The final \noverall yield of WES for this cohort, combining the initial results with the reanalysis, was 27.9%.  \n Alfares et al. (2018) examined the clinical utility of WGS compared to re- analysis of W ES. All cases that underwent CAP \naccredited CLIA lab WES and WGS in the genetics clinic of King Abdulaziz Medical City between 2013- 2017 were \nexamined, regardless of phenotype. WES was performed on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq, or on an Ion Proton system. The average coverage depth was 95X. WGS was performed on a HiSeq 4000. The average coverage depth was \n30X. Variant call files (VCF) were obtained for each case, and raw data analysis was performed in cases where the final \nresults showed discrepancies. Discrepancies were classified into three categories; due to the time interval between tests, \nnew discoveries could explain the discrepancy, intronic or large CNVs  may not have been seen due to WES limitations, \nand finally, the type of sequencing system could have created the discrepancy. Overall, 154 patients were included in the \nstudy and had negative comparative genome array results with had negative or inconclus ive WES results. Most were \nmale (56%), pediatric (91%) and consanguineous (70%). Forty -six were eventually excluded because WGS results were \nincomplete, additional testing was required, or WES VCF were not available from prior testing. The remaining 108 patients had complete clinical information and final WES and WGS results available. Of these, 10 patients had positive WGS \nresults with prior negative WES results, and 5 had inconclusive results. The remaining 93 had negative WGS results. The \naverage time between WES testing and WGS testing was only 5 months, and in that time no new clinical information was \ncollected on the 10 positive WGS patients. However, in 3 cases, variants were found in WES, but not reported, because \nthe data that demonstrated their pathoge nicity was published after the initial WES was completed. In addition, four cases \nthat had WES performed by the Ion Proton system missed variants that were anticipated to be found by WES. Original raw data files were not available from this lab to determine if the variants were present but filtered out, or if the genes \nwere not adequately covered. Additional WES analysis using the Illumina system in these patients detected these four variants. Overall, only 3 cases were positive by WGS that were completely unidentifiable by WES. The authors concluded \nthat in the final 108 patients, if they had re- analyzed the original WES data, they would have identified 30% of the positive \ncases, and that WGS only achieved a 7% higher detection rate. It was concluded that f or this population re -analysis of \nWES data before, or in lieu of WGS, may have better clinical utility. Limitations of this study include the small sample size \nand the high rate of consanguinity, which may have resulted in a disproportionate number of posi tives on the initial WES \ntest, which could in general limit the utility of WGS in the study population.  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 17 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n To evaluate the ability of exome reanalysis to lead to a diagnosis,  Wenger et al. (2017) performed reanalysis of exome \nand phenotypic clinical information from 40 individuals who had previously undergone WES with nondiagnostic results \nusing up- to-date software and literature. The majority (28/40) had a neurologic or neurodevelopmental condition. For 10% \nof the participants, reanalysis led to a definitive diagnosis. At the time of their initial ES, literature linking causative genes \nto the phenotypes of the individuals studied was weak, nonexistent,  or difficult to locate. This is because approximately \n250 gene- disease and 9,200 variant -disease associations are described yearly; per the authors, this necessitates regular \nreevaluation of previously nondiagnostic exomes . This study suggests reanalysis at a frequency of 2 -3 year intervals \ncould result in a 10% diagnostic yield. Larger studies are recommended to define standard timeframes for reanalysis with consideration for the evolving rate of discovery of rela tionships between genes and phenotypes and associated cost.  \n \nRapid Whole Exome Sequencing (rWES), Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS),  \nand Ultra -Rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (urWGS)  \nGenetic disorders are often associated with infant death, particularly infants in neonatal and pediatric intensive care units . \nUnfortunately, receipt of results from standard NGS can take weeks to months. Because an early and accurate diagnosis \nis essential for the treatment of gravely ill infants, genomic sequencing tests with rapid turnaround -times have been \ndeveloped. Current peer -reviewed evidence supports the diagnostic and clinic al utility of these rapid and ultra- rapid tests \nfor critically ill infants in an inpatient setting only; the use of outpatient rapid or ultra- rapid genomic sequencing is not \nsupported at this time.  \n \nXiao et al. (2022) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis to summarize the diagnostic utility of rapid genomic \nsequencing in the evaluation of critically ill infants. Twenty -three studies including 1,567 infants met inclusion criteria and \nwere analyzed. Overall, pooled diagnostic utility of rapid genomic sequencing was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.37- 0.49, I2 = 79%, p < \n0.1). The diagnostic rate of rWES was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.41- 0.61; I2 = 74%; p < 0.01), slightly higher than that of rWGS at \n0.37 (95% CI: 0.30- 0.46; I2 = 77%; p < 0.01). Overall, the authors assert that this review and meta- analysis support the \nuse of rapid genomic sequencing in critically ill infants, but recommend additional large, high- quality randomized \ncontrolled trials due to limitations in some studies included in this analysis. As included study’s participants were critically ill, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear. Publications by Kingsmore et al. (2019), discussed below, and Dimmock et al. (2021), Gubbels et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2020), French et al. (2019), Petrikin et al. \n(2018), Stark et al. (2018), and Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018), previously discussed in this policy, and were included in \nthe Xiao systematic review and meta- analysis.  \n Dimmock et al. (2020) reported the results of clinician surveys regarding the clinical utility of rWGS. Clinicians surveyed \nhad cared for infants when genomic sequencing results were returned as part of the second Newborn Sequencing in Genomic Medicine and Public Health (NSIGHT2) study. NSIGHT2 was a randomized controlled trial of rWGS, rWES)and \nurWGS (used for gravely ill infants) performed on infants with diseases of unknown etiology in intensive care units (ICUs). The goal of the NSIGHT study was to compare two methods of rapid genomic sequencing (rWGS or rWES) and two interpretation methods in acutely ill infants in terms of outcomes and utility. The clinician surveys used in this study found \nthat clinicians perceived diagnostic genomic sequencing to eit her be useful or very useful for 77% of infants tested. \nClinical management was reported to have been changed for 28% of infants, with greatest impact seen in those who received urWGS and positive test results. Rapid genomic sequencing was perceived to hav e changed outcomes for 15% \nof infants in the study. Clinicians did not perceive significant differences between WES vs WGS or between rapid or ultra -\nrapid sequencing in terms of clinical utility. Study results led the authors to conclude that broad use of genomic \nsequencing as a first -tier test for infants with diseases of unknown etiology in ICUs is associated with utility in over 75% of \ncases, management changes in more than 25% and outcome changes in 15% of infants. In addition, there was perceived \ncommu nication improvement with 40% of families. The researchers feel that this data supports standard use of genomic \nsequencing for use in infants in ICUs. However, the clinicians’ survey was not collected using a validated tool and the relevance of the study f indings on clinical outcome is unclear and was not examined as part of this study. Furthermore, as \nparticipants were in the ICU, the generalizability of these findings to the outpatient setting is unclear.  \n \nNSIGHT2, a prospective, randomized, controlled,  and blinded trial of the clinical utility of rWES and rWGS on 1,248 \ncritically ill infants from Rady Children’s hospital, was performed by Kingsmore et al. (2019). Forty -six percent had \nconditions of unknown etiology and parent/child trio samples were available from 69% of participating families. Within 96 hours of hospital admission, 213/1,248 (37%) infants were enrolled and due to disease severity. Eleven percent (24) \nreceived urWGS and were not randomized. Of the remaining 189 infants, 95 were randomized to rWES and 94 to rWGS. \nThe analytical performance of rWGS surpassed rWES including ClinVar pathogenic variants (p = 0.0001). The diagnostic \nperformance was similar for rWGS and rWES yielding 19% vs 20%, res pectively. Resulting time for diagnosis was also \nnot significantly different; 11 vs 11.2 days, respectively, for rWGS and rWES. The proportion of diagnosis made by \nurWGS (46%) was greater than that of rWES/rWGS (p = 0.004; result time was also less, p < 0. 0001). Performing reflex \ntrio testing following a negative proband result increased the diagnostic yield by 0.7%. Published data from NSIGHT2 \nyielded 92% clinical utility for the 24 individuals undergoing urWGS and 73% clinical utility overall for the 189 infants who \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 18 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n were randomized to rWGS and rWES. The authors concluded that rapid genome sequencing can be considered as a first -\ntier diagnostic test for inpatient, critically ill children. urWGS results in the shortest turnaround time which was crucial for \nthose infants  whose diagnosis will impact immediate medical management. As study participants were all seriously ill, it is \nunclear whether these findings apply to less seriously ill infants or to the outpatient setting. The authors indicated that a \ndirect comparison of the diagnostic performance of urWGS and rWES is warranted, with larger sample size than what was \nused for this study, and, ideally, performance of both tests in each proband.  \n \nSanford et al. (2019) performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating the clinical utility of rWGS in critically ill childr en. A \nsingle tertiary children’s hospital pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) enrolled 38 children four months to 18 years with \nundiagnosed disease. rWGS was performed with targeted phenotype- driven analysis for patients and their parents when \npossible. A genetic diagnosis using rWGS was obtained in 17 (45%) of the patients. Pathogenic variants identified were \nassociated with epileps y, autoimmune, immunologic/inflammatory disorders and cardiomyopathy including ventricular \ndysrhythmia. A diagnostic yield of 30 -50% was attained by rWGS in addition to a substantial time savings. Of the 17 \npatients with a genetic diagnosis, four had a change in medical management including genome- informed changes in \nmedications. The researchers also stated that 82%of these diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient \nafter discharge. Additionally, 9 of the 17 diagnosed patients (53%) had no developmental delay or dysmorphic features. \nSanford et al. concluded that data was limited in older children, but their report supports the findings of a previous study \nby Mestek -Boukhibar et al. (2018) that achieved a genetic diagnosis in 42% of 24 pediatri c and cardiac ICU critically ill \nchildren. According to the authors, further studies are needed to identify PICU patients who will benefit from rapid whole \ngenome sequencing early in PICU admission when the underlying etiology is unclear. The implications of these findings \noutside of the PICU setting are unclear.  \n Clark et al. (2019) described the analytical validity and clinical validity of an approach to rWGS utilizing a platform designed for rapid, population scale sequencing using automated phenotyping and interpretation tools to make a \nprovisional diagnosis. Conventional rWGS relies on preparing purified DNA from blood, DNA quality review, normalization \nof DNA concentration, preparation of the sequencing library, and library quality assessment. This platform instead relies \non manually preparing libraries directl y from blood samples or dried blood spots using microbeads with appropriate \nchromosomal segments (transposons). This method proved to be faster and less labor intensive. In four timed runs, the mean time to prepare the library was two hours and 45 minutes,  as compared to ten hours by conventional methods. In \nthe conventional approach, after preparation, samples were sequenced with the HiSeq 2500 sequencer in rapid run \nmode, with one sample processed per instrument, taking an average of 25 hours. In the modi fied approach, rWGS was \nperformed on the NovaSeq6000 and S1 flow cell, as this instrument is faster with automated washing after a run. In four \ntimed trials, sequencing took a mean of 15 hours and 32 minutes and yielded 404- 537 Gb per flow cell, enough for  two or \nthree 40x genome sequences. Analysis of the sequence data was performed utilizing Dynamic Read Analysis for \nGENomics (DRAGEN), software that was optimized for speed, sensitivity,  and accuracy. Alignment and variant calling \ntook a median of 1 hour a nd is similar to standard methods. Structural variants were not included. Analysis of relevant \nvariants is typically achieved through filtering based on patient phenotype, and typically this is done by manual input of the \npatient’s clinical features. Which features to select can be subjective and biased, and often incomplete. The team \ndeveloped a natural language processing algorithm to extract clinical features from unstructured text in the EHR and optimized the algorithm from the training set used by Rady  Hospital on 16 children with genomic disease and enriched \nwith text used to identify children with orphan diseases. This included mapping 60% of Human Phenotype Ontology \n(HPO) terms and 75.4% of Orphanet Rare Disease HPO terms to SNOMED CT by lexical and logical methods and then \nmanually verifying them. This set was then tested on a group of 10 children who had genome sequencing for genetic \ndisease diagnosis to determine if the automated phenotype extraction from the EHR was reliable. A detailed manual \nreview of the EHR was compared to the output of the algorithm, and the sensitivity was found to be 80%. To determine \nthe clinical validity of this approach, the algorithm was compared in 101 children who had WGS where the phenotype to \nuse for analysis was sel ected by a clinical expert. The algorithm identified 27- fold more phenotypic features than the \nexpert manual selection, and four -fold more than if Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man (OMIM) terms alone were used. \nThe process described was tested retrospect ively in 95 children who had already had prior manual expert interpretation, \nand a second manual expert interpretation and the automated process were compared. The new manual expert \ninterpretation was concordant with the prior results in 93 children, with two children being issued new reports with new \nrevised diagnoses. The automated approach was concordant with the new manual review in 99% of cases, and with the prior manual review in 97% of cases. This process was tested prospectively in seven seriously i ll infants in the NICU. The \nmedian time from blood sample to diagnosis for 19 hours and 56 minutes, compared with the standard testing time of 48 \nhours and 23 minutes. Three patients received a genetic diagnosis, confirmed by the standard method and Sanger  \nsequencing. One patient’s diagnosis was 16 hours earlier and another 27 hours earlier than the conventional approach \nresulting in earlier and more confident treatments than would have otherwise been considered.  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 19 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n Whole  Transcriptome Sequencing \nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of whole  transcriptome sequencing for diagnosing rare genetic diseases \nat this time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of this technology.  \n \nLee et al. (2020) studied transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) related to improvement of diagnostic rates based on WES \nor WGS for undiagnosed genetic disorders  in 113 probands with a high- likelihood of having a rare genetic disorder. \nParticipants underwent  a thorough clinical evaluation prior to enrollment in this study with no diagnosis obtained; each \nwas subsequently  referred to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). RNAseq testing was done along with WES or \nWGS . The results of RNAseq were combined with genome sequencing results to obtain genome- wide DNA variant \ninterpretation. WES was performed on 29 of the individuals and WGS was performed on 77 individuals. An additional \nseven individuals had prior sequencing performed; these results were obtained and reanalyzed. Upon clinical evaluation \nby UDN, thirteen individuals were excluded from the study due to inconsistencies in clinical information. Of these 100 \nprobands, 31 individuals were diagnosed through the use of WES or WGS alone. Forty -eight families (91 s amples) who \ntested  negative based on WGS of coding SNVs, small indels , and SV s were evaluated with RNAseq. An additional 284 \nsamples were run as controls. The integration of RNAseq results with WGS data led to the diagnosis of an additional \nseven cases (15%; 95% CI, 7 –27%) , bringing the overall diagnostic rate to 38% (95% CI, 29– 48%) . The researchers \nnoted that in these seven cases, the types of variants identified could not have been determined without the use of \nRNAseq.  The study was limited by its small cohort size which  underwent evaluation in a highly specialized referral center , \nand the ability to discern some pertinent genes due to lack of expression in the tissues accessible for testing. Additional studies on broader populations and focused on improvement of external differentiation of accessible cells to specific cell \ntypes in order to better detect genes with RNAseq are recommended.  \n \nWhole Genome Optical Mapping  \nThere is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of whole genome optical mapping for any indication.  Although it \nshows early  promise for comprehensive detection of genetic abnormalities related to multiple constitutional and somatic \ndiseases, f urther  development of the technology and additional studies will be needed to investigate potential  clinical \nutility . \n \nMantere et al. (2021) explored the use of optical genome mapping (OGM) for the detection of known constitutional \nchromosome abnormalities  in a proof -of-principle study . In this study, 85 samples from blood or cultured cells were used \nto obtain ultra -high-molecular -weight DNA which was then processed with OGM.  The reasons for genetic referral included \nDD encompassing ASD and/or ID whether associated with congenital malformations or not (n = 49), reproductive \ndisorders (n  = 1 5), family history of chromosome abnormality (n = 12) and abnormal prenatal screening or ultrasound (n = \n9). The result was compared to known anom alies obtained via current standard -of-care tests including karyotyping, FISH \nand/or CNV microarray. A total of 99 chromosomal abnormalities were evaluated and 100% concordance of OGM with \nstandard assays was reached (for anomalies with non- centromeric breakpoints). Per the authors, this result indicates that \nOGM is capable of identifying almost all types of chromosomal abnormalities.  They foresee  continuing improvement in \nboth the technical and analytical properties of OGM along with the ongoing progress  filling in the human reference \ngenome. Work to improve efficiency in reporting algorithms for SV and CNV  and faster turnaround times are also \nanticipated, after which large, high- qualit y clinical utility studies can be performed; these are necessary before OCM can \nbe clinically implemented in the diagnostic process.  \n Additional peer -reviewed literature addressing whole genome optical mapping consists mainly of case reports and/or \nsmall case series  where this technology was assessed in relation to various indications (Dremsek et al., 2021; Dai et al, \n2022; Erbe et al. 2023; Ke et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) . \n \nClinical Practice Guidelines  \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN)/American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN and AANEM have indicated that there is low level evidence to consider WES or WGS in selected individuals \nwith congenital muscular dystrophy in whom a genetic variation has not been identified through standard testing \napproaches. Individuals with congenital muscular dystrophy that do not have causative genetic variations identified through routine methods can be considered for WES or WGS when those technologies are clinically available. Evidence \nLevel C (Kang et al., 2015, reaffirmed 2021).  \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 20 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nIn an AANEM 2016 consensus statement, the group stated that while they do not endorse or recommend a specific \ntesting methodology, genetic testing to establish a molecular diagnosis is a crucial step in providing optimal care to individuals with neuromuscular disorders (Kassardjian et al., 2016, reaffirmed 2021).  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) \nIn a 2021 practice guideline authored by Manickam et al., the ACMG asserts their position that evidenced- based literature \nsupports clinical utility of whole exome and whole genome sequencing on both active and long- term management of \nindividuals with congenital anomalies, developmental delay,  and intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). Based on their \ncomprehensive systematic review, limited evidence for negative outcomes was found. As such, the AMCG recommends \nuse of whole exome and whole genome sequencing as a first- or second -tier test for individuals with one or more CAs \nwith onset prior to one year of age or for individuals with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of age.  \n \nIn an ACMG policy statement, Miller et al. (2021a) published updated recommendations for reporting secondary findings \n(SF) in ES and GS. The recommendations included  an SF list, which was created to provide a “minimum list” of actionable \nSF and indicate that this list should only include genes where the clinically relevant variants are detected as part of \nstandard clinical ES/GS. The 2021 list, SF v3.0  (Miller et al., 2021b) , contained 73 genes and detailed the way that  genes \nare selected to be added or removed from the SF list. In 2022, Miller et al. updated the list  (v3.1); a  total of five new genes \nwere added including BAG3, DES, RBM20, TNNC1  (cardiomyopathy) and TTR (hereditary TTR  amyloidosis ). The 2023 \nv3.2 update by Miller et al. included the addition of 3 new genes including CALM1 , CALM2 , and CALM 3 (related to \npredisposition for long QT syndrome) , bringing the number of genes on the most current SF list to 81.  \n \nMonaghan et al (2020) published a “points to consider” document on the use of fetal exome sequencing in prenatal \ndiagnosis for ACMG. This document is meant to be used as an educational resource for clinicians. There were numerous \nconsiderations stated that  span from pretest to reporting, post -test, cost, re -analysis, target family testing, and health -care \nprofessional education. The authors concluded that exome sequencing may be considered when a diagnosis cannot be \nobtained via routine prenatal methods in a fetus with anomalies.  \n \nA 2019 ACMG statement (Deignan et al.) addressed points to consider in the reevaluation and reanalysis of genomic test \nresults. Noting that the phenotype of impacted individuals may change or evolve over time and that information regarding \nthe phenotypic s pectrum of a condition and relevant related variants may also expand, this ACMG statement asserts that \nreanalysis is critical in the diagnostic odyssey. The document goes on to provide guidance to assist laboratories with \ndeveloping policies and protocols or both variant and case level re -evaluation and reanalysis.  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)/Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP)  \nACMG and AMP released guidance to laboratories in 2015 (Richards et al.) on how to evaluate variations found through \nnext generation sequencing (NGS), including WES and WGS. They also highlighted the responsibility of the ordering \nprovider in the process, stating “due to the complexity of genetic testing, optimal results are best realized when the \nreferring healthcare provider and the clinical laboratory  work collaboratively in the testing process .” \n \nThe guidelines emphasize that healthcare providers need to be prepared to provide detailed information on other lab tests \nperformed, clinical evaluations and testing, and patient phenotype. They need to understand that some results returned, \nsuch as “variants of unknown significan ce,” may not be actionable, or the clinical implication may be unknown for \npathogenic mutations. Testing of additional family members may be required to interpret the test results of the patient. \nFinally, as new data emerges, the interpretation of a variant may change over time and the healthcare provider must be \nprepared to monitor and manage changing interpretations. As highlighted by ACMG and AMP, “variant analysis is at \npresent imperfect and the variant category reported does not imply 100% certainty.”  \n \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  \nIn the Committee Opinion 682 (2016, reaffirmed 2023 ), ACOG states that “the routine use of whole- genome or whole -\nexome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer -\nreviewed data and validation studies are published.”  \n \nObstetric Care Consensus Number 10 (ACOG, 2020, reaffirmed 2021)  addressing the management of stillbirth indicates \nthat whole exome or whole genome sequencing may, in the future, become part of the workup for stillbirth, but currently, \nthis technology is not part of a standard evaluation for stillbirth . \n \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 21 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n ACOG’s 2018 (reaffirmed 2023) Technology Assessment Number 14 addresses whole genome and whole exome \nsequencing, indicating that whole exome sequencing (WES) is more frequently utilized in clinical genetics, as it has  \ngreater clinical relevance and applicability  to patient care. The assessment notes that when standard testing from \namniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling fails to lead to a diagnosis, WES as a prenatal test may be reasonable in \ncertain circumstances ( e.g., fetuses  with multiple anomalies, cases of recurrent fetal phenotypes lacking diagnosis by \nstandard genetic tests.  \n \nAmerican Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) \nASHG (Botkin et al., 2015) makes the following recommendations pertaining to WES or WGS in  children and adolescents:  \n Genetic testing should be limited to single gene or targeted gene panels based on the patient’s clinical presentation \nwhen appropriate.  \n When targeted testing using WES or WGS is performed as an alternative to single gene or targeted panel testing, it is \nethically acceptable to limit the analysis to the specific genes of  clinical  interest.  \n WES or WGS is appropriate when prior, more limited genetic testing has failed to identify a causative variant. Under \ncertain circumstances,  WES or WGS may be appropriate as an initial genetic test.  \n WES or WGS is not indicated for screening healthy children.  \n \nEuropean Society of Human Genetics (ESHG)  \nSouche et al. (2022) published recommendations for use of WGS  in diagnostics for rare diseases which was the result of \ncollaboration of EuroGentest, a working group of the ESHG , and Horizon 2020 project Solve -RD which seeks to uncover \ngenetic causes for currently unsolved rare genetic diseases  using various analytical techniques.  The recommendations \ninclude 44 statements which now incorporate the use of WGS, focusing on diagnostic NGS used in a clinical setting for \nthe diagnosis of rare diseases and address  many aspects of diagnostic testing including evaluation and rationale to setup \nof NGS applications including such things as quality control, variant interpretation and reporting of NGS results. General \nrecommendations include:  \n It is recommended to introduce WGS analysis in a diagnostic setting when it is a relevant improvement on quality, efficiency,  and/or diagnostic yield.  \n Diagnostic WGS for rare diseases and cancer (as well as other genetic testing approaches) should only be performed in accredited laboratories . \n NGS should not be transferred to clinical practice without acceptable validation of the tests . \n Confirmation, interpretation,  and communication to the patient of results obtained in a research setting should always \nbe done after re- testing on (preferably) an independent sample by a diagnostic laboratory . \n \nInternational Society of Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD published an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for prenatal diagnosis, \nnoting the rapid increase of research and clinical use of this technology for prenatal diagnosis of fetuses at risk for genet ic \ndisorders  (Van den Veyver et al, 2022) . Current evidence does not support routine testing of fetal tissues obtained from \nan invasive prenatal procedure such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the absence of fetal \nanomalies. The position statement indicates there is data to support benefit of prenatal sequencing for the following:  \n Current pregnancy where fetus has a major single anomaly or multiple  organ system anomalies and;  \no No genetic diagnosis found after CMA and genetic expert considers the phenotype suggestive of genetic etiology . \no Multiple anomaly  pattern strongly suggests a single gene disorder with no prior genetic testing. CMA should be \nrun before in in parallel with prenatal exome sequencing (pES) in this case.  \n Personal history of prior undiagnosed fetus or child with a major single or multiple anomalies and;  \no Recurrence of similar anomalies in current pregnancy without genetic diagnosis after karyotype or CMA for \ncurrent or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \no When parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected proband, or if a \nfetal sample is unable to be obtained in ongoing pregnancy, sequencing may be offered for both biological \nparents to look for shared carrier status  of autosomal recessive mutations that could explain phenotype. Tissue \nfrom previous abnormal fetus/child for pES is preferable.  \no In special circumstances, consideration of testing may be given in circumstances where it would not normally be \nadvised, such as strong family history of recurrent childhood- onset severe genetic condition in specific \ncircumstances, but these should be revi ewed by an expert multi -disciplinary team, most appropriately in the \ncontext of a research protocol.  \n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  \nA 2022 NICE guideline addressing epilepsies in children, young people and adults advocates consideration of whole-\ngenome sequency for individuals with epilepsy with no known cause who:  \n\n \nWhole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing (Non -Oncology Conditions)  Page 22 of 28 \nUnitedHealthcare Commercial and Individual Exchange Medical Policy  Effective 04/01/202 5 \nProprietary Information of UnitedHealthcare. Copyright 202 5 United HealthCare Services, Inc.  \n \n Were less than two years of age at the onset of epilepsy . \n Were two to three years of age at the onset of epilepsy when specialty multidisciplinary team has evaluated and \nrecommended.  \n Have clinical features that suggest a specific genetic epilepsy syndrome (e.g., Dravet syndrome) . \n Have clinical features such as, LD, ASD, structural abnormality (e.g., dysmorphism or congenital malformation) . \n Has unexplained cognitive or memory decline.  \n The guideline further recommends the discussion of any uncertainties around genetic testing with a geneticist or \nneurologist, use of the NHS National Genomic Test Directory (2018, updated 2023) for rare and inherited disease, and comprehensive genetic counseling with the individuals and their family/caregivers as appropriate.  \n \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) \nIn a 2022  evidence -based practice guideline, the NSGC (Smith et al.) provided recommendations regarding the use of \ngenetic testing for individuals with epilepsy, noting that a majority of unexplained epilepsy  is estimated to have an \nunderlying genetic etiology.  The recommendations are as follows:  \n Genetic testing with exome/genome sequencing and/or a multi -gene panel (>  25 genes) is strongly recommended for \nall individuals with unexplained epilepsy, regardless of age, as first -tier testing , followed by chromosomal microarray. \nExome/genome sequencing is conditionally recommended over multi -gene panel.  \n It is strongly recommended that genetic tests be selected, ordered, and interpreted by a qualified healthcare provider in the context of appropriate pre - and post -test genetic counseling.  \n \nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  \n This section is to be used for informational purposes only.

Coverage criteria differ based on the type of testing being performed \n(i.e., individual epilepsy genes separately chosen versus pre-defined panels of \nepilepsy genes). \nEpilepsy single gene tests \nEpilepsy single gene tests are considered medically necessary when the following \ncriteria are met: \nThe member has a condition that will benefit from information provided by the \nrequested epilepsy gene testing based on at least one of the following criteria: \noThe member displays clinical features of the condition for which testing is being \nrequested and a particular treatment is being considered for the member that \nrequires a genetic diagnosis, OR\noA particular antiepileptic drug (AED) is being considered for the member and the\nAED is contraindicated for individuals with mutations in the requested gene, \ndefined by ONE of the following criteria: \nA neurology therapy FDA label requires results from the genetic test to \neffectively or safely use or avoidance of the therapy for the member’s \nepilepsy type and the member has not previously had a trial of the therapy, \nor\nAn American neurological society specifically recommends the testing for the\nsafe and effective use or avoidance of a therapy and the member has not \npreviously had a trial of the therapy, OR\noThe member meets all criteria in a test-specific guideline, if available (see Table:\nCommon epilepsy genes, associated conditions and applicable guidelines ), AND\nThe member does not have a known underlying cause for their seizures (e.g. tumor,\nhead trauma, known genetic condition), AND\nRendering laboratory is a qualified provider of service per the Health Plan policy.\nEpilepsy multi-gene panels \nEpilepsy multigene panels are considered medically necessary when all of the \nfollowing criteria are met: \nThe member has a diagnosis of early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, OR\nThe member has a diagnosis of infantile spasms, OR\nThe member has a diagnosis of intractable, neonatal seizures, OR\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Seizure \ntypes include generalized seizures (absence seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic \nseizures), focal seizures (simple focal seizures, complex focal seizures, secondary \ngeneralized seizures, among others), and seizures for which the type is unknown. \nEpilepsy syndromes can be associated with generalized, focal, or combined \ngeneralized and focal seizures, and can have onset in childhood or adulthood.2 \nEpilepsy syndromes may be associated with developmental and/or epileptic \nencephalopathy (childhood onset) or progressive neurological deterioration (later \nonset).2 \nCause \nEpilepsy has multiple causes, including central nervous system infection, autoimmune \ndisease, structural brain abnormalities, brain tumors, and head trauma.3 There are also\nnumerous genetic conditions associated with epilepsy. It is estimated that \napproximately 40% of individuals with seizures have an underlying genetic basis for \ntheir condition (see Table 1 for a list of common genetic causes).4 Factors that \ncontribute to the likelihood of a genetic basis includes type of seizures (focal or \ngeneralized) or epilepsy syndromes (such as epileptic encephalopathy), age of onset, \nfamily history, and presence of other clinical features.\nThrough Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based testing, including multi-gene \npanels, whole exome and genome sequencing as well as whole-genome screening for \nCNVs, pathogenic sequence variants have been identified in about 30-40% and \ndeletions or duplications in ~5-10% of patients with a range of epilepsy phenotypes, \nincluding focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsies, epileptic encephalopathies, fever-\nassociated epilepsy syndromes, other epilepsy syndromes, and patients with \nneurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.5,6 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 11 of 20\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Epilepsy                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nThere are many different epilepsy syndromes, including generalized epilepsy \nsyndromes, focal epilepsy syndromes, combined generalized and focal epilepsy \nsyndromes, epilepsy syndromes with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy \n(DEE). These syndromes can present at variable ages ranging from neonatal to \nadulthood.2,7 \nDEE is a group of disorders in which seizures are accompanied by developmental \ndelays, cognitive impairment, or a host of other neurological issues such as feeding \ndifficulties, sleep dysregulation, and behavioral problems.8 Knowledge regarding the \ngenetic basis of these disorders has increased significantly in the last decade due to \nthe advent of high throughput NGS methods, resulting in wider availability of multi-gene\npanel testing. The following are examples of epileptic encephalopathies:\nOhtahara Syndrome (Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy)\no“Characterized by early onset intractable tonic spasms, suppression-burst \npattern on interictal EEG, and poor prognosis.”  9 \no“To date various genes, which have essential roles in the brain’s neuronal and \ninterneuronal functions, have been reported to be associated with Ohtahara \nsyndrome. For instance, syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) regulates synaptic\nvesicle release; aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) acts as a regulator of \nproliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors; solute carrier family 25 \nmember 22 (SLC25A22) encodes a mitochondrial glutamate transporter13; and \npotassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 2 (KCNQ2) plays\na key role in a cell’s ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.”  10 \nDravet Syndrome (Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy)\no“Clinical cardinal features include febrile or afebrile generalized or \nhemiconvulsions starting in the first year of life, seizure evolution to a mixture of \nintractable generalized (myoclonic or atonic seizures, atypical absences) and \nfocal seizures, normal early development, subsequent psychomotor retardation, \nand normal brain imaging at onset.”  9 \no“In most of the cases with Dravet syndrome, one single gene has been involved,\nin contrast to other epileptic encephalopathy syndromes. SCN1A mutations \nhave been shown in at least 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome.”  10 \nInfantile Spasms (West Syndrome and X-linked Infantile Spasms)\no“West syndrome is characterized by a specific seizure type, i.e., epileptic \nspasms, a unique interictal EEG pattern termed hypsarrhythmia, and \npsychomotor retardation. Spasms start within the first year of life, mainly \nbetween 4 and 6 months of age.”  9 \no“There are multiple genetic determinants of infantile spasms, which are usually \nexplained by mutations in distinct genes. Genetic analysis of children with \nunexplained infantile spasms have demonstrated mutations on the X \nchromosome in genes such as ARX, cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), \nand UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit (ALG13) as well as de novo \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Seizure, cognitive, and \npsychiatric phenotypes show heterogeneity. Seizures start from the age of 6 to \n36 months and may be precipitated by fever. Seizure types include GTCS, \nmyoclonic and tonic seizures, absences, and focal.”  9 \no“Different mutations of PCDH19 (protocadherin 19), including missense, \nnonsense, and frameshift mutations, have been reported as the cause of \nEFMR.” 9 \nInheritance \nInheritance patterns differ between various epilepsy syndromes, and include \nmonogenic inheritance patterns such as dominant, X-linked, recessive, and \nmitochondrial, in addition to epilepsy caused by de novo (i.e. new) genetic mutations. \nClinical heterogeneity is also seen in these conditions.\nDiagnosis \nAn electroencephalograph (EEG) can be used to help diagnose epilepsy and possibly \ngive information as to the seizure type. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \nscan can further help define whether epilepsy is caused by a structural brain \nabnormality or help determine the origin of epilepsy. \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is complicated by many factors. Epilepsy syndromes \nfrequently have overlapping features, such as the types of seizures involved and/or \nadditional clinical findings. Many (if not most) epilepsy syndromes, including epileptic \nencephalopathy, are genetically heterogeneous, and can be caused by mutations in a \nnumber of different genes. Sometimes, the inheritance pattern or the presence of \npathognomonic features makes the underlying syndrome clear. However, in many \ncases, it can be difficult to reliably diagnose a genetic epilepsy syndrome based on \nclinical and family history alone.\nNGS-based testing has been shown to dramatically improve the diagnostic rate for \nchildren and adults with epilepsy, as well as significantly shorten the time from \nassessment to diagnosis.11-13 The diagnostic yield of NGS in patients with epilepsy is \nestimated to be 20-40%.6,14,15 \nClinical information (e.g. age of onset, seizure type, EEG results, etc.) or family history \nmay be used in some cases to help narrow down the suspected cause.

Not all \ntreatments will work for everyone and often, it takes multiple treatment trials to find a \nregimen that is successful. Refractory epilepsy is diagnosed after two or more AEDs \nhave failed to control seizures. Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined as \"failure of \nadequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules \n(whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom\".16\nIn a rapidly growing number of epilepsy disorders, knowing the genetic mutation that is \nresponsible for the epilepsy has been shown to help guide management and provide \nmore disease-specific treatment.17,18 \nSurvival \nLifespan is dependent upon seizure control and the underlying cause of the individual's\nepilepsy.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nGenetic testing for epilepsy may consist of next-generation sequencing or multigene \npanels.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nMulti-Gene Testing Panels \nThe efficiency of NGS has led to an increasing number of large, multi-gene testing \npanels. NGS panels that test several genes at once are particularly well-suited to \nconditions caused by more than one gene or where there is considerable clinical \noverlap between conditions making it difficult to reliably narrow down likely causes. \nAdditionally, tests should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of identifying mutations \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

In this age period, the diagnostic yield of \ngenetic testing may reach up to 60%. However, age at testing (as opposed to the \nage at onset of epilepsy) should not influence the decision to test or the type of test \nchosen. Individuals who are now adults who had early-onset epilepsy likely \npresented in the era before genetic testing was widely available, and should be \nconsidered candidates for testing.\" \n\"Clinical utility of genetic testing is highest in the more severe, drug-resistant \nepilepsies . Overall, the most obvious indication, in terms of clinical utility and \ndiagnostic yield, is for people with early-onset DEE or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders with epilepsy.

Testing of individuals with drug-resistant non-\nacquired epilepsy without such comorbidities could be useful as identification of an \nunderlying genetic cause might lead to a more targeted treatment.\"\nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors practice guideline on epilepsy (2022), \nwhich was endorsed by the American Epilepsy Society (AES), stated:7\n\"We strongly recommend that individuals with unexplained epilepsy be offered \ngenetic testing, without limitation of age.\"\n\"We strongly recommend comprehensive, multi-gene testing, such as ES/GS \n[exome sequencing/genome sequencing] or MGP [multigene panels] as a first-tier \ntest. We conditionally recommend ES/GS over MGP as the first-tier test.\"\n\"The MGP panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and include copy number \nanalysis.\"\n\"MGPs are valuable clinical tools that can be employed in a number of clinical \nscenarios, for example, when an individual presents with a defined epilepsy \nsyndrome for which a subset of genes should be interrogated more robustly than \nthrough ES when GS is unavailable. Additionally, if urgent results are required and \nrapid ES/GS is unavailable, a targeted MGP may be considered. MGPs may also \nbe utilized as a first-tier test when access to ES/GS, or the additional genetic \ncounseling required to implement such testing, may be limited.\"\nSelected Relevant Publications \nPeer reviewed and expert authored articles are presented below. \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic testing for epileptic encephalopathy \nstated the following: \no“Second line investigations: Targeted next generation sequencing panels of \nepileptic encephalopathy genes for individuals with epileptic encephalopathy.”  8 \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic causes of early-onset epileptic \nencephalopathy stated the following:10 \no“Molecular-based studies on early-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be \nperformed, necessitating programmed genetical algorithms. If the phenotype \ncould be determined with clinical findings, specific gene testing would be helpful \nin diagnosis. However, if the phenotype could not be determined because of \noverlapping phenotypes of different syndromes and the spectrum of phenotypes\nseen in different mutations, the use of gene panels for epilepsy would increase \nthe probability of correct diagnosis. In a recent study, the rate of diagnosis with \ntargeted single gene sequencing has been reported as 15.4%, whereas the rate\nhas increased to 46.2% with the utility of epilepsy gene panels.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

P OLICY               \nGenetic testing for genes associated with infantile- and early-childhood onset epilepsy \nsyndromes in individuals with infantile- and early-childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes in which \nepilepsy is the core clinical symptom (see Policy Guidelines section) may be considered \nmedically necessary if positive test results may: \n \n1. Lead to changes in medication management; AND/OR  \n2. Lead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests \nare avoided; AND/OR  \n3. Lead to changes in reproductive decision-making.  \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other indications. There is \ninsufficient evidence to support a general conclusion concerning the health outcomes or \nbenefits associated with this procedure.  \nPolicy Guidelines \nApplication of Medically Necessary Policy Statement  \nAlthough there is no standard definition of epileptic encephalopathies, they are generally \ncharacterized by at least some of the following: (1) onset in early childhood (often in infancy); (2) \nrefractory to therapy; (3) associated with developmental delay or regression; and (4) severe \nelectroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities. There is a challenge in defining the population \nappropriate for testing given that specific epileptic syndromes may be associated with different \nEEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe \nseizures prior to the onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However, for this \npolicy, the medically necessary policy statement would apply for patients with: \n1. Onset of seizures in early childhood (i.e., before the age of 5 years); AND  \n2. Clinically severe seizures that affect daily functioning and/or interictal EEG \nabnormalities; AND POLICY  PRODUCT VARIATIONS  DESCRIPTION/BACKGROUND  \nRATIONALE  DEFINITIONS   BENEFIT VARIATIONS  \nDISCLAIMER  CODING INFORMATION  REFERENCES  \nPOLICY HISTORY     \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 2  \n3. No other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient’s symptoms.  \nIncluded Tests/Conditions \nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that is possibly genetic.  In 2010, the International \nLeague Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as having underlying genetic cause or etiology \nwhen, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic \ndefect and seizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or \nmetabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy. The updated 2017 ILAE classification system does \nnot discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause. \nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (e.g., Dravet syndrome, early infantile \nepileptic encephalopathy, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and \nintellectual disability limited to females, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and others). Other \nclinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes but are generally secondary to the \nepilepsy itself. \nExcluded Tests and Conditions \nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of \nsymptomatology, of which seizures may be one, such as the neurocutaneous disorders (e.g., \nneurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral \nmalformations or abnormal cortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. \nGenetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed in other policies (see Cross-\nreference section).  \nTesting that is limited to genotyping of CYP450  genes is addressed separately (MP 2.234). \nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B*1502 allelic variant in patients \nof Asian ancestry prior to considering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe \ndermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) labeling for carbamazepine. \nThis policy also does not address the use of testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA \npolymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically suspected mitochondrial disorders \nprior to initiation of therapy with valproate. Valproate’s label contains a black box warning \nrelated to increased risk of acute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients \nwith POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA labeling states: “Valproate \nis contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by variants in \nmitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG; e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) and children \nunder two years of age who are suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.  \nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and Testing Strategy \nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, are severe, and are characterized by epilepsy as the primary manifestation, without \nassociated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League \nAgainst Epilepsy, these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndrome \nassociated with a high probability of encephalopathic features that present or worsen after the \nonset of epilepsy. Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 3  \nintellectual disability, may be present secondary to the epilepsy itself. Specific clinical \nsyndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include: \n Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n[SMEI] or polymorphic myoclonic epilepsy in infancy [PMEI]) \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with intellectual disability) \n Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep \n GEFS+ syndrome (generalized epilepsies with febrile seizures plus) \n Ohtahara syndrome (also known as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst \nsuppression pattern) \n Landau-Kleffner syndrome \n West syndrome  \n Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. \nVariants in a large number of genes have been associated with early-onset epilepsies.

If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based on history, EEG findings, and \nother test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most \nlikely to be involved, followed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular, if an \nSCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+), molecular genetic \ntesting of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by \ndeletion/duplication analysis if a pathogenic variant is not identified, should be obtained.  \nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses \na multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In these cases, panels should meet the \ncriteria outlined in MP 2.323 (General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels). \nCriteria for use of whole exome sequencing are outlined in MP 2.324 (Whole Exome and Whole \nGenome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders). \nGenetics Nomenclature Update \nThe Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants \nfound in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \nPG2). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP) standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants \nrepresent expert opinion from ACMG, AMP, and the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG2.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \n \nCross-reference:  \nMP 2.234  Cytochrome P450 Genotype Guided Treatment Strategy \nMP 2.276  Genetic Testing for FMR1  Variants (Including Fragile X Syndrome) \nMP 2.323  General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels       \nMP 2.324  Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic \nDisorders  \nMP 2.326 General Approach to Genetic Testing \n \nII.

It is a common \nneurologic disorder, with approximate 3% of the population developing the disorder over their \nentire lifespan.  \nSudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as a sudden, unexpected, \nnontraumatic, and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy, excluding documented status \nepilepticus, with no cause of death identified following comprehensive postmortem evaluation.  \nClassification \nEpilepsy is heterogeneous in etiology and clinical expression and can be classified in a variety \nof ways. Most commonly, classification is done by the clinical phenotype, i.e., the type of \nseizures that occur. In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) updated its \nclassification system that is widely used for clinical care and research purposes (see Table 1). \nClassification of seizures can also be done on the basis of age of onset: neonatal, infancy, \nchildhood, and adolescent/adult. \nTable 1.

Genetic epilepsies are characterized by recurrent unprovoked \nseizures in patients who do not have demonstrable brain lesions or metabolic abnormalities. In \naddition, seizures are the core symptom of the disorder, and other symptomatology is not \npresent, except as a direct result of seizures. This is differentiated from genetically determined \nconditions in which seizures are part of a larger syndrome, such as tuberous sclerosis, fragile X \nsyndrome, or Rett syndrome. \nThe review focuses on the category of genetic epilepsies in which seizures are the primary \nclinical manifestation. This category does not include syndromes that have multiple clinical \nmanifestations, of which seizures may be one. Examples of syndromes that include seizures are \nRett syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Genetic testing for these syndromes will not be \nassessed herein but may be included in separate reviews that specifically address genetic \ntesting for that syndrome. \nGenetic epilepsies can be further broken down by type of seizures. For example, genetic \ngeneralized epilepsy refers to patients who have convulsive (grand mal) seizures, while genetic \nabsence epilepsy refers to patients with nonconvulsive (absence) seizures. The disorders are \nalso sometimes classified by the age of onset. \nThe category of genetic epilepsies includes a number of rare epilepsy syndromes that present in \ninfancy or early childhood. These syndromes are characterized by epilepsy as the primary \nmanifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. They are often \nsevere and sometimes refractory to medication treatment. They may involve other clinical \nmanifestations such as developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, which in many cases \nare thought to be caused by frequent uncontrolled seizures. In these cases, the epileptic \nsyndrome may be classified as an epileptic encephalopathy, which is described by ILAE as \ndisorders in which the epileptic activity itself may contribute to severe cognitive and behavioral \nimpairments above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology alone \nand that these can worsen over time. A partial list of severe early-onset epilepsy syndromes is \nas follows: \n Dravet syndrome \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with mental retardation) \n Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy \n GEFS+ syndrome (genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus) \n EIEE syndrome (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst) \n West syndrome \n Ohtahara syndrome \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 8  \nDravet syndrome falls on a spectrum of SCN1A- related seizure disorders, which includes febrile \nseizures at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized \ntonic-clonic seizures at the severe end. The spectrum may be associated with multiple seizure \nphenotypes, with a broad spectrum of severity; more severe seizure disorders may be \nassociated with cognitive impairment, or deterioration. Ohtahara syndrome is a severe early-\nonset epilepsy syndrome characterized by intractable tonic spasms, other seizures, interictal \nelectroencephalography abnormalities, and developmental delay. It may be secondary to \nstructural abnormalities but has been associated with variants in the STXBP1  gene in rare \ncases. West syndrome is an early-onset seizure disorder associated with infantile spasms and \nthe characteristic electroencephalography finding of hypsarrhythmia. Other seizure disorders \npresenting early in childhood may have a genetic component but are characterized by a more \nbenign course, including benign familial neonatal seizures and benign familial infantile seizures. \nGenetic Etiology \nMost genetic epilepsies are primarily believed to involve multifactorial inheritance patterns. This \nfollows the concept of a threshold effect, in which any particular genetic defect may increase the \nrisk of epilepsy but is not by itself causative. A combination of risk-associated genes, together \nwith environmental factors, determines whether the clinical phenotype of epilepsy occurs. In this \nmodel, individual genes that increase the susceptibility to epilepsy have a relatively weak \nimpact. Multiple genetic defects, and/or a particular combination of genes, probably increase the \nrisk by a greater amount. However, it is not well understood how many abnormal genes are \nrequired to exceed the threshold to cause clinical epilepsy, nor is it understood which \ncombination of genes may increase the risk more than others. \nEarly-onset epilepsy syndromes may be single-gene disorders. Because of the small amount of \nresearch available, the evidence base for these rare syndromes is incomplete, and new variants \nare currently being frequently discovered.   \nSome of the most common genes associated with genetic epileptic syndromes are listed in \nTable 2.  \nTable 2.

Ohtahara syndrome \nhas been associated with variants in STXBP1  in cases where patients have no structural or \nmetabolic abnormalities. West syndrome is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities or \ntuberous sclerosis or may be secondary to an identifiable infectious or metabolic cause, but \nwhen there is no underlying cause identified, it is thought to be due to a multifactorial genetic \npredisposition.   \nColl et al (2016) evaluated the use of a custom resequencing panel including genes related to \nsudden death, epilepsy, and SUDEP. New potential candidate genes for SUDEP were detected: \nFBN1, HCN1, SCN4A, EFHC1, CACNA1A, SCN11A, and SCN10A. \nTargeted testing for individual genes is available. Several commercial epilepsy genetic panels \nare also available. The number of genes included in the tests varies widely, from about 50 to \nover 450. The panels frequently include genes for other disorders such as neural tube defects, \nlysosomal storage disorders, cardiac channelopathies, congenital disorders of glycosylation, \nmetabolic disorders, neurologic syndromes, and multisystemic genetic syndromes. Some \npanels are designed to be comprehensive while other panels target specific subtypes of \nepilepsy. Chambers et al (2016) reviewed comprehensive epilepsy panels from 7 U.S.-based \nclinical laboratories and found that between 1% and 4% of panel contents were genes not \nknown to be associated with primary epilepsy. Between 1% and 70% of the genes included on \nan individual panel were not on any other panel. \nTreatment \nThe condition is generally chronic, requiring treatment with one or more medications to \nadequately control symptoms. Seizures can be controlled by antiepileptic medications in most \ncases, but some patients are resistant to medications, and further options such as surgery, \nvagus nerve stimulation, and/or the ketogenic diet can be used.   \nPharmacogenomics \nAnother area of interest for epilepsy is the pharmacogenomics of antiepileptic medications. \nThere are a wide variety of these medications, from numerous different classes. The choice of \nmedications, and the combinations of medications for patients who require treatment with more \nthan 1 agent is complex. Approximately one-third of patients are considered refractory to \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 10  \nmedications, defined as inadequate control of symptoms with a single medication. These \npatients often require escalating doses and/or combinations of different medications. At present, \nselection of agents is driven by the clinical phenotype of seizures but has a large trial-and-error \ncomponent in many refractory cases. The current focus of epilepsy pharmacogenomics is in \ndetecting genetic markers that identify patients likely to be refractory to the most common \nmedications. This may lead to directed treatment that will result in a more efficient process for \nmedication selection, and potentially more effective control of symptoms. \nOf note, genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry, prior to \nconsidering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions, is \nrecommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling for carbamazepine.   \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments. Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are \navailable under the auspices of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories \nthat offer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement \nAmendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has \nchosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.  \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \n \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \n \nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who \nreceive testing for genes associated with epileptic encephalopathies, the evidence includes \nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are \ntest accuracy and validity, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For Dravet syndrome, which appears to \nhave the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-\nassociated variants is high ( 80%). For other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true \nclinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However, studies reporting on \nthe overall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy \nhave reported detection rates for clinically significant variants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The \nclinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known \npathogenic variant. The presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication \nmanagement, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive planning. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in \nthe net health outcome. \nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants \nassociated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort \nstudies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, changes in \nreproductive decision making, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For most genetic epilepsies, which are \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 11  \nthought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic \nvariants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a large body of literature on associations \nbetween genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly \nunderstood. Published literature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which \nhave not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of studies have also \nreported associations between genetic variants and AED treatment response, AED adverse \neffect risk, epilepsy phenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. The largest \nnumber of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics, which has generally reported \nsome association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , \nEPHX1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 ), and  AED response. Similarly, genetic associations between a \nnumber of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported. However, no empirical \nevidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the \nchanges in clinical management that might occur as a result of testing are not well defined. The \nevidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nN/A \n \nVI.

It is a heterogeneous condition that encompasses many types of seizures and varies in\nage of onset and severity . Many genetic epilepsies are thought to have a complex, multifactorial genetic basis. There are also numerous rare epileptic\nsyndromes associated with global developmental delay and/or cognitive impairment that occur in infancy or early childhood, and that may be caused\nby a single-gene pathogenic variant . Genetic testing is commercially available for a large number of genes that may be related to epilepsy .\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether genetic testing improves the net health outcome in individuals with infantile- or early-\nchildhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy or with presumed genetic epilepsy .\n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nGenetic testing for genes associated with infantile- and early-childhood onset epilepsy syndromes in individuals with infantile- and early-childhood-\nonset epilepsy syndromes in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (see Policy Guidelines section) may be considered medically necessary  if\npositive test results may:\nLead to changes in medication management; AND/OR\nLead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests are avoided ; AND/OR\nLead to changes in reproductive decision making.\nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other situations.\nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nPolicy Scope\nIncluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that might have a genetic etiology . In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as\nhaving underlying genetic cause or etiology when, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic defect and\nseizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or metabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy . The updated 2017 ILAE\nclassification system does not discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause.\nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom ( eg,\nDravet syndrome, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy , generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and intellectual disability limited to\nfemales, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy). Other clinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes  but are generally  secondary to epilepsy\nitself.\nExcluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of symptomatology , of which seizures may be one, such as the\nneurocutaneous disorders ( eg, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral malformations or abnormal\ncortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. Genetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed  in other evidence\nreviews (see Related Policies links).\nTesting that is limited to genotyping of cytochrome P450 ( CYP450)  genes is addressed  separately (evidence review 2.04.38).\nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry prior to  considering drug treatment\nwith carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nlabeling for carbamazepine.\nThis policy also does not address the testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA  polymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically\nsuspected mitochondrial disorders prior to  initiation of therapy with valproate. V alproate\"s label contains a black box warning related to increased risk of\nacute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients with POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA  labeling states\nthat valproate \" is contraindicated  in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under 2 years of age who\nare clinically suspected  of having a POLG-related disorder”.\nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and T esting Strategy\nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, are severe, and are characterized by\nepilepsy as the primary manifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League Against\nEpilepsy , these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndromes associated with a high probability of encephalopathic features\nthat present or worsen after the onset of epilepsy . Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or  intellectual disability , may be\npresent secondary to the epilepsy  itself. Specific clinical syndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include:FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers.

Some of them are summarized  in Table PG1.\nTable PG1.

There is a challenge in defining the population appropriate for testing given that specific epileptic\nsyndromes may be associated  with dif ferent EEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe seizures prior to\nthe onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However , for this policy , the medically necessary policy statement would apply for\npatients with :\nOnset of seizures in early childhood (ie, before the age of 5 years); AND\nClinically severe seizures that af fect daily functioning and/or  interictal EEG abnormalities; AND\nNo other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient\"s symptoms.\n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nTesting Strategy\nThere is clinical and genetic overlap for many of the electroclinical syndromes previously discussed. If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based\non history , EEG findings, and other test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most likely to be involved,\nfollowed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular , if an SCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+),\nmolecular genetic testing of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by deletion and duplication analysis if a pathogenic\nvariant is not identified , should be obtained.\nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses a multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In\nthese cases, panels should meet the criteria outlined in evidence review 2.04.92 (general approach to evaluating the utility of genetic panels). Criteria\nfor use of  whole exome sequencing are outlined  in evidence review 2.04.102 (whole exome and whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of genetic\ndisorders).\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (T able PG2). The Society\"s\nnomenclature is recommended  by the Human V ariome Project, the Human  Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology<97>\"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign”<97>to describe\nvariants identified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG2.

They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nGenetic Counseling\nGenetic counseling is primarily aimed at patients who are at risk for inherited disorders, and experts recommend formal genetic counseling in most\ncases when genetic testing for an inherited condition is considered. The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\nFDA REGULA TORY STATUS\nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the\ngeneral regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are\navailable under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity testing.\nTo date, the FDA  has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who receive testing for genes associated with epileptic\nencephalopathies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For Dravet syndrome, which\nappears to have the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-associated variants is high (up to 80%). For other\nearly-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true clinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However , studies reporting on the\noverall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy have reported detection rates for clinically significant\nvariants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The clinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known pathogenic variant.\nThe presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication management, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive\nplanning. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants associated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes\nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test validity , changes in reproductive decision making,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For most genetic epilepsies, which\nare thought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic variants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a\nlarge body of literature on associations between genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly understood. Published\nliterature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which have not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of\nstudies have also reported associations between genetic variants and antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment response, AED adverse ef fect risk, epilepsy\nphenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The largest number of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics,\nwhich has generally reported some association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , EPHX1 , CYP2C9 ,\nCYP2C19 ) and AED response. Similarly , genetic associations between a number of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported.\nHowever , no empirical evidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the changes in clinical management that\nmight occur as a result of testing are not well-defined. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Neurology et al.\nIn 2006, the American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society published joint guidelines on the diagnostic assessment of children with\nstatus epilepticus.86, These guidelines were reviewed and reaf firmed in 2022. With regard to  whether genetic testing should be routinely ordered  for\nchildren with status epilepticus, the guidelines stated: \"There is insuf ficient evidence to support or refute whether such studies should be done\nroutinely .”\nIn 2000, the American Academy of Neurology , Child Neurology Society , and the American Epilepsy Society published joint guidelines for evaluating a\nfirst nonfebrile seizure in children.87, This guidance was reviewed and reaf firmed in 2023. Routine electroencephalography was recommended  as part\nof the diagnostic evaluation; genetic testing was not addressed .\nInternational League Against Epilepsy\nIn 2015, the International League Against Epilepsy issued a report with recommendations on the management of infantile seizures, which included the\nfollowing related to genetic testing in epilepsy41,:\n\"Genetic screening should not be undertaken at a primary or secondary level of care, as the screening to identify those in need of specific\ngenetic analysis is based  on tertiary settings.”\n\"Standard care should permit genetic counseling by trained personnel to be undertaken at all levels of care (primary to quaternary).”\n\"Genetic evaluation for Dravet syndrome and other infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be available at tertiary and quaternary\nlevels of care (optimal intervention would permit an extended genetic evaluation).”\n\"Early diagnosis of some mitochondrial conditions may alter long-term  outcome, but whether screening at quaternary level is beneficial is\nunknown.”\nNational Society of Genetic Counselors\nIn 2022, the National Society of Genetic Counselors published a practice guideline on genetic testing and counseling for unexplained epilepsies.88,The\nSociety made the following relevant recommendations:\n\"We strongly recommend that individ uals with unexplained epilepsy be of fered genetic testing,  without limitation of age.\nWe strongly recommend comprehensive, multi- gene  testing, such as exome/ge nome sequencing  or multi- gene panel  as a first- tier test.\nWe conditionally recommend exome/ge nome sequencing  over multi- gene panel  as the first- tier test.\nThe multi-gene panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and  include copy number analysis.\"\n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nEuropean Academy of Neurology\nIn 2010, the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now the European Academy of Neurology) issued guidelines on the molecular diagnosis\nof channelopathies, epilepsies, migraine, stroke, and dementias.89, The guidelines made the following recommendations on epilepsy:\n\"There is good evidence to suggest that a thorough clinical and electrophysiological investigation may lead to the choice of the gene to be tested in\npatients with periodic paralysis (Level B). In myotonic disorders, it is recommended to first search for myotonic dystrophy and use clinical and\nelectrophysiological phenotype characterization to guide for molecular genetic testing (Level B).\nMolecular investigations are possible and may help in some cases to diagnose the condition but cannot be considered  as a routine procedure with\nregard to  the large  number of dif ferent mutations [variants] in dif ferent genes. Furthermore, diagnosis can be made more easily by clinical and\nphysiological investigation (Good Practice Point). One exception of note is the diagnosis of SMEI , in which mutations [variants] are found  in SCN1A  in\n80% of the patients (Level B).”\nNorth American Consensus Panel\nIn 2017, recommendations were published from a consensus panel of 14 physicians and 5 family members/caregivers of patients with Dravet\nsyndrome.90, There was strong consensus among panel members that genetic testing should be completed in all patients with clinical suspicion for\nDravet syndrome since this can lead to earlier diagnosis. Options for testing include SCN1A  sequencing followed by testing for deletions and\nduplications if sequencing is negative, or epilepsy gene panel testing, with no consensus among panel members about which option is superior . There\nwas strong consensus that epilepsy gene panel testing is preferred to SCN1A  testing if the clinical presentation is less clear or if the patient has\natypical features, and that karyotyping is not needed. The panel did not reach consensus about the utility of chromosomal microarray in patients with\nsuspected Dravet syndrome (72.2% agreed, 22.2% disagreed, 5.6% did not know) and concluded that this test can be considered. Based on strong\nconsensus, the panel recommended genetic testing in the following circumstances among children with normal development, seizures of unknown\netiology , and no evidence of causal lesion in the brain: infants with at least 2 prolonged focal febrile seizures, or children aged 1 to 3 years with at least\none prolonged febrile seizure before 18 months of age or myoclonic or atypical absence seizures that are refractory to at least one antiepileptic\nmedication. Infants who experience a single prolonged focal or generalized convulsion do not require genetic testing (strong consensus), but this can\nbe considered in children aged 1 to 3 years who experience multiple brief episodes of febrile seizure activity before 18 months of age or myoclonic or\natypical absence seizures that do not respond to antiepileptic medication (moderate consensus). The panel had moderate consensus about the role of\ngenetic testing (epilepsy gene panel) in teens and adults without congenital dysmorphism who have seizure activity resistant to antiepileptic medication\nand lack an early life history .\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for determining hereditary breast and\novarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy . Testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all\nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years, may be indicated for\nguiding cancer therapies. Genetic testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in breast cancer-, pancreatic cancer-, prostate cancer-, or ovarian cancer-\naffected individuals who are considering systemic therapy is addressed separately in evidence reviews 2.04.151, 2.04.148, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156,\nrespectively . Genetic testing for PALB2  variants in pancreatic cancer-af fected individuals is also addressed in 2.04.148. Additionally , conflicting criteria\nreflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited or no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of\ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.\nCurrent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation. W omen with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should\nreceive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine T umors\nCurrent NCCN guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( v .2.2024) refers to the NCCN guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk assessment of breast,\novarian, and pancreatic cancers detailed above, and state: \"The panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer\nand in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for inherited susceptibility .\" The panel recommends \"using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary\ncancer syndromes.\"89,\nThe NCCN guidelines for genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers ( v .3.2024) states that germline testing is\nclinically indicated for individuals with neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers per the NCCN guidelines on neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors.90, The\nNCCN guidelines for neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors ( v .1.2024) states, \"consider genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing: In a patient with\nduodenal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at any age\", noting, \"studies of unselected patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have identified\ngermline variants in 16%-17% of cases. However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result\non the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).

If the individual  with  \ncancer  has pancreatic  cancer  or prostate  cancer  (metastatic  or intraductal/cribriform  or high -\nrisk group  or very -high -risk group)  then  only  first-degree  relatives  should  be offered  testing  \nunless  there  are other  family  history  indications  for testing.  \n• An individual  with  any type  of cancer  (cancer  related  to hereditary  breast  ovarian  cancer  \nsyndrome  but not meeting  above  criteria,  or cancer  unrelated  to hereditary  breast  ovarian  \ncancer  syndrome)  or unaffected  individual  who  otherwise  does  not meet  the criteria  above  but \nhas a probability  >5%  of a BRCA1 /2 or PALB2  pathogenic  variant  based  on prior  probability  \nmodels  (e.g., Tyrer -Cuzick,  BRCAPro,  Pennll).  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   3 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nGenetic  testing  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  of cancer -affected  individuals  or cancer -unaffected  \nindividuals  with  a family  history  of cancer  when  criteria  above  are not met is considered  investigational . \nTesting  for PALB2  variants  in individuals  who  do not meet  the criteria  outlined  above  is considered  \ninvestigational . \nGenetic  testing  in minors  for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  variants  for hereditary  breast  ovarian  cancer  \nsyndrome  is considered  investigational  (see Policy  Guidelines).  \nGenetic  Counseling  \nDocumentation  of individualized  genetic  counseling  is required  before  any genetic  testing  will be \nconsidered  medically  necessary.  See MP 2.04.570 . \nPOLICY  GUIDELINES  \nPlans  may  need  to alter  local  coverage  medical  policy  to conform  to state  law regarding  coverage  of \nbiomarker  testing.  \nThere  are differences  in the position  statements  above  and the National  Comprehensive  Cancer  \nNetwork  (NCCN)  guideline  on Genetic/Familial  High -Risk Assessment:  Breast,  Ovarian,  and Pancreatic  \n(v.3.202 4). Not all of the NCCN  criteria  are clearly  separated  for determining  hereditary  breast  and \novarian  cancer  syndrome  versus  for guiding  therapy.  Testing  for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and/or  PALB2  outside  of \nthe above  criteria,  such  as testing  all individuals  with  triple  negative  breast  cancer  or testing  all \nindividuals  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  under  the age of 50 years,  may  be indicated  for guiding  cancer  \ntherapies.  Genetic  testing  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  in breast  cancer -, pancreatic  cancer -, prostate  \ncancer -, or ovarian  cancer -affected  individuals  who  are considering  systemic  therapy  is addressed  \nseparately  in evidence  reviews  2.04.151,  2.04.148,  2.04.155,  and 2.04.156,  respectively.  Genetic  testing  \nfor PALB2  variants  in pancreatic  cancer -affected  individuals  is also addressed  in 2.04.148.  Additionally,  \nconflicting  criteria  reflect  that some  of the NCCN  criteria  are based  on limited  or no evidence;  the lower  \nlevel  of evidence  might  be needed  when  determining  coverage  of testing  mandated  by state  biomarker  \nlegislation.  \nCurrent  U.S. Preventive  Services  Task  Force  guidelines  recommend  screening  women  with  a personal  or \nfamily  history  of breast,  ovarian,  tubal,  or peritoneal  cancer  or who  have  an ancestry  associated  with  \nBRCA1 /2 gene  mutation.  Women  with  a positive  result  on the risk assessment  tool should  receive  \ngenetic  counseling  and,  if indicated  after  counseling,  genetic  testing  (B recommendation).  \nRecommended  screening  tools  designed  to identify  a family  history  that may  be associated  with  an \nincreased  risk for potentially  harmful  variants  in BRCA1  or BRCA2  are: \n• Ontario  Family  History  Assessment  Tool  (FHAT)  \n• Manchester  Scoring  System  \n• Referral  Screening  Tool  (RST)  \n• Pedigree  Assessment  Tool  (PAT)  \n• Family  History  Screen  (FHS -7) \n• International  Breast  Cancer  Intervention  Study  instrument  (Tyrer -Cuziak)  \n• Brief  versions  of the BRCAPRO  \nClose  Relatives  \nClose  relatives  are blood  related  family  members  including  1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-degree  relatives  on the \nsame  side of the family  (maternal  or paternal).  \n• 1st-degree  relatives  are parents,  siblings,  and children.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   4 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \n• 2nd-degree  relatives  are grandparents,  aunts,  uncles,  nieces,  nephews,  grandchildren,  and half-\nsiblings.  \n• 3rd-degree  relatives  are great -grandparents,  great -aunts,  great -uncles,  great -grandchildren,  and \nfirst cousins.  \nProstate  Cancer  Risk Groups  \nRisk groups  for prostate  cancer  in this policy  include  high -risk groups  and very -high -risk groups.  \nHigh -risk group:  no very -high -risk features  and are T3a (American  Joint  Committee  on Cancer  staging  \nT3a = tumor  has extended  outside  of the prostate  but has not spread  to the seminal  vesicles);  OR Grade  \nGroup  4 or 5; OR prostate  specific  antigen  of 20 ng/mL  or greater.  \nVery -high -risk group:  T3b-T4 (tumor  invades  seminal  vesicle(s);  or tumor  is fixed  or invades  adjacent  \nstructures  other  than  seminal  vesicles  such  as external  sphincter,  rectum,  bladder,  levator  muscles,  \nand/or  pelvic  wall);  OR Primary  Gleason  Pattern  5; OR 2 or 3 high -risk features;  OR greater  than  4 cores  \nwith  Grade  Group  4 or 5. \nRecommended  Testing  Strategies  \nIndividuals  who  meet  criteria  for genetic  testing  as outlined  in the policy  statements  above  should  be \ntested  for variants  in BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2 . Recommended  strategies  are listed  below.  \n• In individuals  with  a known  familial  BRCA  or PALB2  variant,  targeted  testing  for the specific  \nvariant  is recommended.  \n• In individuals  with  unknown  familial  BRCA  or PALB2  variant:  \no  \n▪ To identify  clinically  significant  variants,  NCCN  advises  testing  a relative  who  has \nearly -onset  disease,  bilateral  disease,  or multiple  primaries,  because  that \nindividual  has the highest  likelihood  of obtaining  a positive  test result.  Unless  \nthe affected  individual  is a member  of an ethnic  group  for which  particular  \nfounder  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  are known,  comprehensive  \ngenetic  testing  (i.e., full sequencing  of the genes  and detection  of large  gene  \nrearrangements)  should  be performed.  \n▪ If no living  family  member  with  breast  or ovarian  cancer  exists,  NCCN  suggests  \ntesting  first- or second -degree  family  members  affected  with  cancer  thought  to \nbe related  to deleterious  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants  (e.g., prostate  cancer,  \npancreatic  cancer,  melanoma).  \n▪ If no familial  variant  can be identified,  2 possible  testing  strategies  are: \n• Full sequencing  of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed  by testing  for large  genomic  rearrangements  \n(deletions,  duplications)  only  if sequencing  detects  no variant  (negative  result).  \no More  than  90%  of BRCA  variants  will be detected  by full sequencing.  \n• Alternatively,  simultaneous  full sequencing  and testing  for large  genomic  rearrangements  (also  \nknown  as comprehensive  BRCA  testing;  see Comprehensive  Variant  Analysis  below)  may  be \nperformed  as is recommended  by NCCN.  \no Comprehensive  testing  can detect  92.5%  of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.  \n• Testing  for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through  panel  testing  over  serial  testing  might  be \npreferred  for efficiency.  Multi -gene  panels  often  include  genes  of moderate  or low penetrance,  \nand genes  with  limited  evidence  on which  to base  management  decisions.  When  considering  a \ngene  panel,  NCCN  recommends  use of \"tailored  panels  that are disease -focused  and include  \nclinically  actionable  cancer  susceptibility  genes\".  \n• Ashkenazi  Jewish  descent  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   5 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \no In individuals  of known  Ashkenazi  Jewish  descent,  one approach  is to test for the 3 \nknown  founder  mutations  (185delAG  and 5182insC  in BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first;  \nif testing  is negative  for founder  mutations  and if the individual's  ancestry  also included  \nnon-Ashkenazi  ethnicity  (or if other  BRCA1 /2 testing  criteria  are met),  comprehensive  \ngenetic  testing  should  be considered.  \nTesting  strategy  may  also include  testing  individuals  not meeting  the above  criteria  who  are adopted  \nand have  limited  medical  information  on biological  family  members,  individuals  with  small  family  \nstructure,  and individuals  with  presumed  paternal  transmission.  \nComprehensive  Variant  Analysis  \nComprehensive  variant  analysis  currently  includes  sequencing  the coding  regions  and intron  and exon  \nsplice  sites,  as well as testing  to detect  large  deletions  and rearrangements  that can be missed  with  \nsequence  analysis  alone.  In addition,  before  August  2006,  testing  for large  deletions  and rearrangements  \nwas not performed,  thus  some  individuals  with  familial  breast  cancer  who  had negative  BRCA  testing  \nbefore  this time  may  consider  repeat  testing  for the rearrangements  (see Policy  section  for criteria).  \nHigh -Risk Ethnic  Groups  \nTesting  of eligible  individuals  who  belong  to ethnic  populations  in which  there  are well-characterized  \nfounder  mutations  should  begin  with  tests  specifically  for these  variants.  For example,  founder  \nmutations  account  for approximately  three -quarters  of the BRCA  variants  found  in Ashkenazi  Jewish  \npopulations  (see Rationale  section).  When  testing  for founder  mutations  is negative,  a comprehensive  \nvariant  analysis  should  then  be performed.  \nTesting  Unaffected  Individuals  \nIn unaffected  family  members  of potential  BRCA  or PALB2  variant  families,  most  test results  will be \nnegative  and uninformative.  Therefore,  it is strongly  recommended  that an affected  family  member  be \ntested  first whenever  possible  to adequately  interpret  the test.  Should  a BRCA  or PALB2  variant  be \nfound  in an affected  family  member(s),  DNA  from  an unaffected  family  member  can be tested  \nspecifically  for the same  variant  of the affected  family  member  without  having  to sequence  the entire  \ngene.  Interpreting  test results  for an unaffected  family  member  without  knowing  the genetic  status  of \nthe family  may  be possible  in the case  of a positive  result  for an established  disease -associated  variant  \nbut leads  to difficulties  in interpreting  negative  test results  (uninformative  negative)  or variants  of \nuncertain  significance  because  the possibility  of a causative  BRCA  or PALB2  variant  is not ruled  out. \nTesting  for known  variants  of BRCA  or PALB2  genes  in an unaffected  reproductive  partner  may  be \nindicated  as carrier  screening  for rare autosomal  recessive  conditions.  \nConfirmatory  Testing  \nConsideration  might  be given  at the local  level  for confirmatory  germline  testing  of a BRCA  or PALB2  \npathogenic/likely  pathogenic  variant  found  on tumor  genomic  analyses,  direct -to-consumer  testing,  or \nresearch  testing.  \nTesting  Minors  \nThe use of genetic  testing  for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , or PALB2  variants  for identifying  hereditary  breast  ovarian  \ncancer  syndrome  has limited  or no clinical  utility  in minors,  because  there  is no change  in management  \nfor minors  as a result  of knowledge  of the presence  or absence  of a deleterious  variant.  In addition,  \nthere  are potential  harms  related  to stigmatization  and discrimination.

It is being  implemented  for genetic  \ntesting  medical  evidence  review  updates  starting  in 2017  (see Table  PG1).  The Society's  nomenclature  is \nrecommended  by the Human  Variome  Project,  the Human  Genome  Organization,  and by the Human  \nGenome  Variation  Society  itself.  \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  and the Association  for Molecular  Pathology  \nstandards  and guidelines  for interpretation  of sequence  variants  represent  expert  opinion  from  both  \norganizations,  in addition  to the College  of American  Pathologists.  These  recommendations  primarily  \napply  to genetic  tests  used  in clinical  laboratories,  including  genotyping,  single  genes,  panels,  exomes,  \nand genomes.  Table  PG2 shows  the recommended  standard  terminology - \"pathogenic,\"  \"likely  \npathogenic,\"  \"uncertain  significance,\"  \"likely  benign,\"  and \"benign\" - to describe  variants  identified  that \ncause  Mendelian  disorders.  \nTable  PG1.

The interpretation  of the results  of genetic  tests  and the understanding  of risk factors  can \nbe very  difficult  and complex.  Therefore,  genetic  counseling  will assist  individuals  in understanding  the \npossible  benefits  and harms  of genetic  testing,  including  the possible  impact  of the information  on the \nindividual’s  family.  Genetic  counseling  may  alter  the utilization  of genetic  testing  substantially  and may  \nreduce  inappropriate  testing.  Genetic  counseling  should  be performed  by an individual  with  experience  \nand expertise  in genetic  medicine  and genetic  testing  methods.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   7 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nCoding  \nSee the Codes  table  for details.  \nBENEFIT  APPLICATION  \nBlueCard/National  Account  Issues  \nSome  Plans  may  have  contract  or benefit  exclusions  for genetic  testing.  \nUnder  the Patient  Protection  and Affordable  Care  Act, preventive  services  with  a U.S. Preventive  \nServices  Task  Force  recommendation  grade  of A or B will be covered  with  no cost-sharing  requirements.  \nPlans  that have  been  grandfathered  are exceptions  to this rule and are not subject  to this coverage  \nmandate.   \nBenefit  Exceptions  \nThis policy  may  not apply  to all lines  of business  such  as the Federal  Employee  Program,  Medicare  \nSupplement,  Medicare  Advantage,  Medicaid,  and certain  self-insured  groups.  \nBACKGROUND  \nHereditary  Breast  and Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  \nSeveral  genetic  syndromes  with  an autosomal  dominant  pattern  of inheritance  that features  breast  \ncancer  have  been  identified.  Of these,  hereditary  breast  and ovarian  cancer  (HBOC)  syndrome  and some  \ncases  of hereditary  site-specific  breast  cancer  have  in common  causative  variants  in BRCA  (breast  cancer  \nsusceptibility)  genes.  Families  suspected  of having  HBOC  syndrome  are characterized  by an increased  \nsusceptibility  to breast  cancer  occurring  at a young  age, bilateral  breast  cancer,  male  breast  cancer,  \novarian  cancer  at any age, as well as cancer  of the fallopian  tube  and primary  peritoneal  cancer.  Other  \ncancers,  such  as prostate  cancer,  pancreatic  cancer,  gastrointestinal  cancers,  melanoma,  and laryngeal  \ncancer,  occur  more  frequently  in HBOC  families.  Hereditary  site-specific  breast  cancer  families  are \ncharacterized  by early -onset  breast  cancer  with  or without  male  cases,  but without  ovarian  cancer.  For \nthis evidence  review,  BCBSA  refers  collectively  to both  as hereditary  breast  and/or  ovarian  cancer.  \nGermline  variants  in the BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes  are responsible  for the cancer  susceptibility  in most  \nHBOC  families,  especially  if ovarian  cancer  or male  breast  cancer  are features.  However,  in site-specific  \ncancer,  BRCA  variants  are responsible  only  for a proportion  of affected  families.  BRCA  gene  variants  are \ninherited  in an autosomal  dominant  fashion  through  maternal  or paternal  lineage.  It is possible  to test \nfor abnormalities  in BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes  to identify  the specific  variant  in cancer  cases  and to \nidentify  family  members  at increased  cancer  risk. Family  members  without  existing  cancer  who  are \nfound  to have  BRCA  variants  can consider  preventive  interventions  for reducing  risk and mortality.  \nEvidence  suggests  that genetic  services  are not equitably  applied.  Chapman -Davis  et al (2021)  found  that \nnon-Hispanic  Whites  and Asians  were  more  likely  to be referred  for genetic  services  based  solely  on \nfamily  history  than  were  non-Hispanic  Blacks  and Hispanics.1, In addition,  non-Hispanic  Black  patients  \nand Hispanic  patients  were  more  likely  to have  advanced  cancer  when  referred  for genetic  services  than  \nnon-Hispanic  Whites  and Asians.  \nClinical  Features  Suggestive  of BRCA  Variant  \nYoung  age of onset  of breast  cancer,  even  in the absence  of family  history,  is a risk factor  for BRCA1  \nvariants.  Winchester  (1996)  estimated  that hereditary  breast  cancers  account  for 36%  to 85%  of patients  \ndiagnosed  before  age 30 years.2, In several  studies,  BRCA  variants  were  independently  predicted  by early  \nage at onset,  being  present  in 6% to 10%  of breast  cancer  cases  diagnosed  at ages  younger  than  various  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   8 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \npremenopausal  age cutoffs  (age  range,  35 to 50 years).2,3,4,5, In cancer -prone  families,  the mean  age of \nbreast  cancer  diagnosis  among  women  carrying  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants  is in the 40s.6, In the Ashkenazi  \nJewish  population,  Frank  et al (2002)  reported  that 13%  of 248 cases  with  no known  family  history  and \ndiagnosed  before  50 years  of age had BRCA  variants.3, In a similar  study  by Gershoni -Baruch  et al (2000),  \n31%  of Ashkenazi  Jewish  women,  unselected  for family  history,  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  at younger  \nthan  42 years  of age had BRCA  variants.7, Other  studies  have  indicated  that early  age of breast  cancer  \ndiagnosis  is a significant  predictor  of BRCA  variants  in the absence  of family  history  in this \npopulation.8,9,10, \nAs in the general  population,  a family  history  of breast  or ovarian  cancer,  particularly  of early  age onset,  \nis a significant  risk factor  for a BRCA  variant  in ethnic  populations  characterized  by founder  mutations.  \nFor example,  in unaffected  individuals  of Ashkenazi  Jewish  descent,  12%  to 31%  will have  a BRCA  variant  \ndepending  on the extent  and nature  of the family  history.5, Several  other  studies  have  documented  the \nsignificant  influence  of family  history.7,8,9,10,11, \nIn patients  with  “triple -negative”  breast  cancer  (i.e., negative  for expression  of estrogen,  progesterone,  \nand overexpression  of human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2 receptors),  there  is an increased  \nprevalence  of BRCA  variants.  Pathophysiologic  research  has suggested  that the physiologic  pathway  for \nthe development  of triple -negative  breast  cancer  is similar  to that for BRCA -associated  breast  cancer.12, \nIn 200 randomly  selected  patients  with  triple -negative  breast  cancer  from  a tertiary  care  center,  Kandel  \net al (2006)  reported  that there  was a greater  than  3-fold increase  in the expected  rate of BRCA  \nvariants.13,BRCA1  variants  were  found  in 39.1%  of patients  and BRCA2  variants  in 8.7%.  Young  et al \n(2009)  studied  54 women  with  high -grade,  triple -negative  breast  cancer  with  no family  history  of breast  \nor ovarian  cancer,  representing  a group  that previously  was not recommended  for BRCA  testing.14, Six \nBRCA  variants  (5 BRCA1 , 1 BRCA2 ) were  found,  for a variant  rate of 11%.  Finally,  Gonzalez -Angulo  et al \n(2011)  in a study  of 77 patients  with  triple -negative  breast  cancer,  reported  that 15 patients  (19.5%)  had \nBRCA  variants  (12 in BRCA1 , 3 in BRCA2 ).15, \nPALB2  Gene  \nThe PALB2  gene  (partner  and localizer  of BRCA2 ) encodes  for a protein  first described  in 2006.16, The \ngene  is located  at 16p12.2  [Short  (p) arm of chromosome  16 at position  12.2.]  and has 13 exons.  PALB2  \nprotein  assists  BRCA2  in DNA  repair  and tumor  suppression.  Heterozygous  pathogenic  PALB2  variants  \nincrease  the risk of developing  breast  and pancreatic  cancers;  homozygous  variants  are found  in Fanconi  \nanemia.  Fanconi  anemia  is a rare disorder,  primarily  affecting  children,  that causes  bone  marrow  failure.  \nAffected  individuals  also carry  a risk of cancers  including  leukemia.  Most  pathogenic  PALB2  variants  are \ntruncating  frameshift  or stop  codons,  and are found  throughout  the gene.  Pathogenic  PALB2  variants  \nare uncommon  in unselected  populations  and prevalence  varies  by ethnicity  and family  history.  For \nexample,  Antoniou  et al (2014)  assumed  a prevalence  of 8 per 10,000  in the general  population  when  \nmodeling  breast  cancer  risks.17, Variants  are more  prevalent  in ethnic  populations  where  founder  \nmutations  have  persisted  (e.g., Finns,  French  Canadians,  Poles),  while  infrequently  found  in others  (e.g., \nAshkenazi  Jews).18,19, In women  with  a family  history  of breast  cancer,  the prevalence  of pathogenic  \nPALB2  variants  ranges  between  0.9%  and 3.9%,17, or substantially  higher  than  in an unselected  general  \npopulation.  Depending  on population  prevalence,  PALB2  may  be responsible  for as much  as 2.4%  of \nhereditary  breast  cancers17, , and in populations  with  founder  mutations  cause  0.5%  to 1% of all breast  \ncancers.20, \nRegulatory  Status  \nClinical  laboratories  may  develop  and validate  tests  in-house  and market  them  as a laboratory  service;  \nlaboratory -developed  tests  must  meet  the general  regulatory  standards  of the Clinical  Laboratory  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   9 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nImprovement  Amendments.  Genetic  tests  reviewed  in this evidence  review  are available  under  the \nauspices  of the Clinical  Laboratory  Improvement  Amendments.  Laboratories  that offer  laboratory -\ndeveloped  tests  must  be licensed  by the Clinical  Laboratory  Improvement  Amendments  for high -\ncomplexity  testing.  To date,  the U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  has chosen  not to require  any \nregulatory  review  of this test.  \nRATIONALE  \nThis evidence  review  was created  in July 1997  and has been  updated  regularly  with  searches  of the \nPubMed  database.  The most  recent  literature  update  was performed  through  June 12, 2024.  \nThis review  was informed  by a TEC Assessment  (1997).21, \nEvidence  reviews  assess  whether  a medical  test is clinically  useful.  A useful  test provides  information  to \nmake  a clinical  management  decision  that improves  the net health  outcome.  That  is, the balance  of \nbenefits  and harms  is better  when  the test is used  to manage  the condition  than  when  another  test or \nno test is used  to manage  the condition.  \nThe first step  in assessing  a medical  test is to formulate  the clinical  context  and purpose  of the test.  The \ntest must  be technically  reliable,  clinically  valid,  and clinically  useful  for that purpose.  Evidence  reviews  \nassess  the evidence  on whether  a test is clinically  valid  and clinically  useful.  Technical  reliability  is \noutside  the scope  of these  reviews,  and credible  information  on technical  reliability  is available  from  \nother  sources.  \nPromotion  of greater  diversity  and inclusion  in clinical  research  of historically  marginalized  groups  (e.g.,  \nPeople  of Color  [African -American,  Asian,  Black,  Latino  and Native  American];  LGBTQIA  (Lesbian,  Gay,  \nBisexual,  Transgender,  Queer,  Intersex,  Asexual);  Women;  and People  with  Disabilities  [Physical  and \nInvisible])  allows  policy  populations  to be more  reflective  of and findings  more  applicable  to our diverse  \nmembers.  While  we also strive  to use inclusive  language  related  to these  groups  in our policies,  use of \ngender -specific  nouns  (e.g.,  women,  men,  sisters,  etc.)  will continue  when  reflective  of language  used  in \npublications  describing  study  populations.  \nTesting  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  Variants  in Individuals  at Risk for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  \nSyndrome  or Other  High -Risk Cancers  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of testing  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  in individuals  at high -risk for hereditary  breast  and \novarian  cancer  (HBOC)  syndrome  is to evaluate  whether  variants  are present  and if so, to determine  the \nappropriate  surveillance  and treatment  to decrease  the risk of mortality  from  breast  and/or  ovarian  \ncancer.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is individuals  with  cancer  (i.e., breast  cancer,  epithelial  ovarian,  \nfallopian  tube,  primary  peritoneal  cancer),  or individuals  with  a personal  or family  history  of cancer  and \ncriteria  that might  suggest  they  are at risk for HBOC  syndrome.  \nInterventions  \nThe intervention  of interest  is BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant  testing.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   10 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nFor patients  without  a cancer  diagnosis  who  are assessing  cancer  risk, results  may  guide  potential  \nprophylactic  measures  such  as surveillance,  chemoprevention,  or prophylactic  mastectomy,  and/or  \noophorectomy.  \nFor patients  with  a cancer  diagnosis,  results  may  guide  treatment  decisions.  \nTesting  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  is conducted  in adults  when  appropriate  treatment  and/or  \nprophylactic  treatment  options  are available.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to manage  HBOC  syndrome  or other  high -risk cancers:  \nstandard  of care  without  genetic  testing.  \nOutcomes  \nThe outcomes  of interest  are overall  survival  (OS),  disease -specific  (breast  and ovarian  cancer)  survival,  \ntest validity,  and quality  of life (QOL;  e.g., anxiety).  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity,  studies  of variant  prevalence  and cancer  risk were  included.  For \nthe evaluation  of clinical  utility,  studies  that represent  the intended  clinical  use of the technology  in the \nintended  population  were  included.  The quality  and credibility  of the evidence  depend  on study  design  \nand conduct,  minimizing  bias and confounding  that can generate  incorrect  findings.  \nEvidence  for the 2 indications  is presented  together  because  there  is overlap  in the evidence  base  for \nthe 2 populations:  (1) patients  at risk for HBOC  syndrome,  and (2) patients  with  other  high -risk cancers  \nsuch  as cancers  of the fallopian  tube,  pancreas,  and prostate.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nPrevalence  of BRCA  Variants  and Risks  of Cancer  and Survival  \nThe prevalence  of BRCA  variants  is approximately  0.1%  to 0.2%  in the general  population.  The \nprevalence  may  be much  higher  for particular  ethnic  groups  with  characterized  founder  mutations  (e.g., \n2.5%  [1/40]  in the Ashkenazi  Jewish  population).  A family  history  of breast  and ovarian  cancer  is an \nimportant  risk factor  for the BRCA  variant;  additionally,  age and ethnicity  could  be independent  risk \nfactors.  \nSystematic  Reviews  \nA systematic  review  published  by Zhu et al (2016)  found  a significantly  lower  risk of OS in breast  cancer  \npatients  with  BRCA1  (pooled  hazard  ratio  [HR],  1.69;  95%  confidence  interval  [CI], 1.35  to 2.12)  and with  \nBRCA2  (pooled  HR, 1.50;  95%  CI, 1.02  to 2.09;  p=.034).22, However,  in patients  with  breast  cancer,  BRCA1  \nand BRCA2  were  not associated  with  a lower  breast  cancer -specific  survival.  \nNelson  et al (2013)  conducted  a systematic  review  that included  meta -analytic  estimates  of the \nprevalence  and penetrance  of BRCA  variants;  this review  was used  to update  the U.S. Preventive  \nServices  Task  Force  (USPSTF)  recommendation  for risk assessment,  genetic  counseling,  and genetic  \ntesting  for BRCA -related  cancer.23, In high -risk women  with  positive  test results,  cumulative  risks  for \ndeveloping  breast  cancer  by age 70 years  were  46%  for BRCA1  and 50%  for BRCA2  when  a single  family  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   11 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nmember  was tested,  and 70%  for BRCA1  and 71%  for BRCA2  when  multiple  family  members  were  \ntested;  cumulative  risks  for developing  ovarian  cancer  by age 70 years  were  41%  for BRCA1  and 17%  for \nBRCA2  when  a single  family  member  was tested;  and 46%  for BRCA1  and 23%  for BRCA2  when  multiple  \nfamily  members  were  tested.  For Ashkenazi  Jewish  women  with  positive  test results,  cumulative  risks  \nfor developing  breast  or ovarian  cancer  by age 75 years  were  34%  and 21%,  respectively.  Nelson  et al \n(2013)  included  meta -analytic  estimates  of BRCA  prevalence  in their  review  for USPSTF.  In unselected  \nwomen,  BRCA  variant  prevalence  estimates  were  0.2%  to 0.3%;  in women  with  breast  cancer,  1.8%  for \nBRCA1  and 1.3%  for BRCA2 ; in women  with  breast  cancer  onset  at age 40 years  or younger,  6%; in \nwomen  from  high -risk families,  13.6%  for BRCA1 , 7.9%  for BRCA2 , and 19.8%  for BRCA1  or BRCA2 ; in \nunselected  Ashkenazi  Jewish  women,  2.1%;  and in Ashkenazi  Jewish  women  from  high -risk families,  \n10.2%.  \nEstimates  of lifetime  risk of cancer  for BRCA  variant  carriers  (penetrance),  based  on studies  of families  \nwith  an extensive  history  of the disease,  have  been  as high  as 85%.  For example,  Kuchenbaecker  et al \n(2017)  found  that the cumulative  risk of breast  cancer  up to age 80 years  was 72%  in BRCA1  carriers  and \n69%  in BRCA2  carriers.24, Because  other  factors  that influence  risk may  be present  in families  with  \nextensive  breast  and ovarian  cancer  histories,  early  penetrance  estimates  may  have  been  biased  \nupward.25, Studies  of founder  mutations  in ethnic  populations  (e.g., Ashkenazi  Jewish,  Polish,  Icelandic  \npopulations)  unselected  for family  history  have  indicated  lower  penetrance  estimates,  in the range  of \n40%  to 60%  for BRCA1  and 25%  to 40%  for BRCA2 .8,11,26,27, However,  a genotyping  study  of Ashkenazi  \nJewish  women  with  incident  invasive  breast  cancer,  selected  regardless  of family  history  of cancer  and \ntheir  family  members,  resulted  in an 82%  lifetime  risk of breast  cancer  for carriers  of any of 3 BRCA  \nfounder  mutations  (185delAG,  5382insC,  6174delT).27, Importantly,  the risk of cancer  in variant  carriers  \nfrom  families  with  little  history  of cancer  (>50%  of all carriers)  did not differ  significantly.  Lifetime  risk \nestimates  of ovarian  cancer  were  54%  for BRCA1  and 23%  for BRCA2  variant  carriers.  \nProspective  Studies  \nWomen  with  a history  of breast  cancer  and a BRCA  variant  have  a significant  risk of contralateral  breast  \ncancer.  In a prospective  study  by Metcalfe  et al (2004),  the 10-year  risk was 29.5%  for women  with  initial  \nstage  I or II diseases.28, In a prospective  study,  Epidemiological  Study  of Familial  Breast  Cancer,  \nMavaddat  et al (2013)  reported  that the cumulative  risk of contralateral  breast  cancer  by age 70 years  \nwas 83%  in the BRCA1  variant  carriers,  and 62%  for BRCA2  variant  carriers.29, These  investigators  also \nreported  cumulative  risks  of breast  cancer  by age 70 years  in women  without  previous  cancer  (60%  in \nBRCA1  carriers,  55%  in BRCA2  carriers).  Similarly,  the cumulative  risk estimates  of ovarian  cancer  by age \n70 years  in women  without  previous  ovarian  cancer  were  59%  for BRCA1  carriers  and 17%  for BRCA2  \ncarriers.  \nBRCA  Variant  Rates  Associated  With  Ovarian  Cancer  \nWomen  with  a personal  history  of ovarian  cancer  have  an increased  rate of BRCA  variants.  In a \nsystematic  review  of 23 studies,  Trainer  et al (2010)  estimated  the rate of BRCA  variants  among  women  \nwith  ovarian  cancer  3% to 15%.30, In this review,  3 U.S. studies  tested  for both  BRCA1  and BRCA2 ; \nincidences  of BRCA  variants  were  11.3%,  15.3%,  and 9.5%.  In the systematic  review  for USPSTF  by \nNelson  et al (2013),  meta -analytic  estimates  of BRCA  prevalence  among  women  with  ovarian  cancer  \nwere  4.4%  for BRCA1  and 5.6%  for BRCA2 .23, Table  1 lists the results  from  several  additional  studies  \nmeasuring  the presence  of BRCA  variants  among  patients  with  ovarian  cancer.31,32,33,34,35, One study  \nnoted  that variant  prevalence  was higher  for women  in their  40s (24%)  and for women  with  serous  \novarian  cancer  (18%).31, Ethnicity  was another  risk factor  for BRCA , with  higher  rates  seen  in women  of \nItalian  (43.5%),  Jewish  (30%),  and Indo -Pakistani  (29.4%)  origin.31, \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   12 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nTable  1.

Reviewers  noted  that these  findings  supported  other  studies  that have  \ndemonstrated  the fimbrial  end of the fallopian  tube  as an important  site of cancer  in those  with  BRCA1  \nor BRCA2  variants.  \nA long -term  study  by Powell  et al (2013;  median  follow -up, 7 years;  range,  3 to 14 years)  followed  32 \nBRCA  variant  carriers  with  occult  malignancy  (4 ovarian,  23 fallopian  tube,  5 ovarian  and fallopian  tube)  \ndiagnosed  of prophylactic  salpingo -oophorectomy.37, Among  15 women  with  invasive  carcinoma  \n(median  age, 50 years),  7 (47%)  experienced  recurrence  at a median  of 33 months,  and OS was 73%.  \nAmong  17 women  with  noninvasive  neoplasia  (median  age,  53 years),  4 (24%)  received  chemotherapy,  \nnone  of whom  experienced  recurrence.  One (6%)  patient  who  did not receive  chemotherapy  \nexperienced  recurrence  at 43 months.  OS was 100%.  The authors  concluded  that,  in BRCA  variant  \ncarriers,  unsuspected  invasive  carcinoma  has a relatively  high  rate of recurrence,  but noninvasive  \nneoplasms  rarely  recur  and may  not require  adjuvant  chemotherapy.  \nBRCA  Variant  Rates  Associated  With  Pancreatic  Cancer  \nUnaffected  individuals  also may  be at high -risk due to other  patterns  of non-breast -cancer  malignancies.  \nA personal  history  of pancreatic  cancer  is estimated  to raise  the risk of a BRCA  variant  by 3.5- to 10-fold \nover  the general  population.38, Table  2 lists the results  from  several  studies  measuring  the presence  of \nBRCA  variants  among  patients  with  pancreatic  adenocarcinoma.39,40,41,42,43,44, Patients  with  pancreatic  \nadenocarcinoma  of Jewish  descent  appear  to have  a higher  prevalence  of BRCA  variants  compared  with  \nthe general  population  of patients  with  pancreatic  adenocarcinoma.  \nTable  2.

For example,  Walsh  et al (2006)  reported  on probands  \nfrom  300 U.S. families  with  4 or more  cases  of breast  or ovarian  cancer  but with  negative  (wild -type)  \ncommercial  genetic  tests  for BRCA1  and BRCA2 .48, These  patients  underwent  screening  with  additional  \nmultiple  DNA -based  and RNA -based  methods.  Of these  300 patients,  17%  carried  previously  undetected  \nvariants,  including  35 (12%)  with  genomic  rearrangement  of BRCA1  or BRCA2 . \nA study  by Palma  et al (2008)  evaluated  251 patients  with  an estimated  BRCA  variant  prevalence  using  \nthe Myriad  II model  of at least  10%.49, In 136 non-Ashkenazi  Jewish  probands,  36 (26%)  had BRCA  point  \nmutations  and 8 (6%)  had genomic  rearrangements  (7 in BRCA1 , 1 in BRCA2 ). Genomic  rearrangements  \ncomprised  18%  of all identified  BRCA  variants.  No genomic  rearrangements  were  identified  in the 115 \nAshkenazi  Jewish  probands,  but 47 (40%)  had point  mutations.  The authors  indicated  that the estimated  \nprevalence  of a variant  did not predict  the presence  of a genomic  rearrangement.  \nClinically  Useful  \nA test is clinically  useful  if the use of the results  informs  management  decisions  that improve  the net \nhealth  outcome  of care.  The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  or \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs).  In their  systematic  review  for the USPSTF,  Nelson  et \nal (2019)  confirmed  that they  identified  no studies  that compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  BRCA  variant  testing.50, \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   14 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nKnowledge  of variant  status  in individuals  at potentially  increased  risk of a BRCA  variant  may  impact  \nhealth  care  decisions  to reduce  risk.51,52,53,54,55,56,57, Risk-reducing  options  include  intensive  surveillance,  \nchemoprevention,  prophylactic  mastectomy,  or prophylactic  oophorectomy.  \nProphylactic  mastectomy  reduces  the risk of breast  cancer  in high -risk women  (based  on family  history)  \nby 90%.52, Prophylactic  oophorectomy  significantly  reduces  the risk of ovarian  cancer  by 80%  or \nmore55,56,58, and reduces  the risk of breast  cancer  by approximately  50%.56, In women  who  have  already  \nhad breast  cancer,  prophylactic  oophorectomy  reduces  the risk of cancer  relapse.42, Prophylactic  \noophorectomy  or salpingo -oophorectomy  in women  with  BRCA1  or BRCA2  reduced  the risk of all-cause  \nmortality  by 60%  to 77%.58,59, For patients  at risk for both  breast  and ovarian  cancer,  a study  by Elmi  et al \n(2018),  drawing  on data  from  the American  College  of Surgeon’s  National  Surgical  Quality  Improvement  \nProgram  dataset,  found  that prophylactic  mastectomy  with  concurrent  salpingo -oophorectomy  was not \nassociated  with  significant  additional  morbidity  compared  with  prophylactic  mastectomy  alone.60, \nSystematic  reviews  of observational  studies  comparing  prophylactic  surgeries  with  observation  in \nwomen  who  had BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  have  demonstrated  that contralateral  prophylactic  \nmastectomy  in women  with  breast  cancer  is associated  with  significantly  lower  all-cause  mortality  while  \nbilateral  prophylactic  mastectomy  was not associated  with  all-cause  mortality.61,62,63, Studies  have  \nindicated  that the results  of genotyping  significantly  influenced  treatment  choices.53,64,57, \nIn a systematic  review  for the USPSTF,  Nelson  et al (2019)  assessed  the efficacy  of risk-reducing  surgery  \nin BRCA -positive  women.50, The literature  search  was conducted  through  March  2019.  A total  of 13 \nobservational  studies  (n=9938)  provided  consistent  and moderate -strength  evidence  of the benefits  of \nrisk-reducing  surgery.  For high -risk women  and variant  carriers,  bilateral  mastectomy  reduced  breast  \ncancer  incidence  by 90%  to 100%  and breast  cancer  mortality  by 81%  to 100%;  oophorectomy  or \nsalpingo -oophorectomy  reduced  breast  cancer  incidence  by 37%  to 83%,  ovarian  cancer  incidence  by \n69%  to 100%.  Some  women  experienced  reduced  anxiety.  Limitations  of the studies  of benefits  included  \nlack of comparison  groups,  variations  in methodology  and enrollment  criteria,  and heterogeneous  \noutcome  measures.  Additionally,  a total  of 14 observational  studies  (n=3073)  provided  low-strength  \nevidence  of the harms  of risk-reducing  surgery.  Adverse  events  included  physical  complications  of the \nsurgery,  postsurgical  symptoms,  and changes  in body  image.  Studies  of harms  shared  the same  \nlimitations  as the studies  of benefits  as noted  above,  with  the addition  that their  findings  were  \ninconsistent  and the sample  sizes  were  smaller.  As reviewers  observed,  it is still currently  unknown  \nwhether  BRCA  variant  testing  reduces  cause -specific  or all-cause  mortality,  or if it improves  the QOL.  \nHarms  associated  with  false -negative  results  or variants  of uncertain  significance  also are unknown.  \nOther  studies  have  looked  at the results  of prostate  cancer  screening  in men  with  BRCA  variants.  The \nImmunotherapy  for Prostate  Adenocarcinoma  Treatment  study  (2011)  evaluated  the results  of \nscreening  in 205 men  40 to 69 years  of age who  were  BRCA  variant  carriers  and 95 control  patients.65, At \nthe baseline  screen,  biopsies  were  performed  in 7.0%  of men  with  a prostate -specific  antigen  level  \ngreater  than  3.0 ng/mL,  and prostate  cancer  was identified  in 3.3%.  This resulted  in a positive  predictive  \nvalue  of 47.6%,  which  is considerably  higher  than  that estimated  for men  at normal  risk. Moreover,  the \ngrade  of tumor  identified  was intermediate  in 67%  of cancers  and high  in 11%.  This differs  from  the \nexpected  distribution  of cancer  grade  in average -risk men,  with  more  than  60%  expected  to have  low-\ngrade  cancer.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   15 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nSection  Summary:  Testing  for BRCA1  and BRCA2  Variants  in Individuals  at Risk for Hereditary  Breast  \nand Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  or Other  High -Risk Cancers  \nEvidence  for the clinical  validity  of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant  testing  consists  of multiple  studies  that \ncalculated  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant  prevalence  among  samples  of patients  with  HBOC  syndrome,  \nfallopian  tube  cancer,  pancreatic  cancer,  and prostate  cancer.  \nRegarding  clinical  utility  of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variant  testing,  current  evidence  has not directly  evaluated  \nmanagement  with  and without  genetic  testing.  In terms  of prophylactic  measures  (mastectomy  and \noophorectomy),  RCTs  would  be difficult  to conduct.  However,  retrospective  analyses  have  shown  that \nprophylactic  mastectomy  and/or  oophorectomy  greatly  reduced  the risk of breast  cancer  (90%  to 100%)  \nand ovarian  cancer  (69%  to 100%).  \nPALB2  and Breast  Cancer  Risk Assessment  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of testing  for PALB2  variants  in women  at high -risk of HBOC  syndrome  is to evaluate  \nwhether  an abnormal  variant  is present  and,  if so, to determine  whether  the variant  conveys  a \nsufficiently  high -risk such  that changes  in surveillance  and/or  treatment  that are likely  to decrease  the \nrisk of mortality  from  breast  cancer  are warranted.  \nPotential  benefit  derives  from  interventions  (screening,  chemoprevention,  risk-reducing  surgery)  that \ncan prevent  first breast  cancer,  contralateral  breast  cancer,  or cancer  in a different  organ  caused  by the \nsame  variant.  Whether  benefit  outweighs  harms  depends  on the risk of developing  breast  cancer  (first  \ncancer  or a contralateral  one)  and the effectiveness  and the harms  of interventions.  \nAssessing  the net health  outcome  requires:  \n• That  a test accurately  identifies  variants  and pathogenicity  can be determined;  \n• That  a variant  alters  (increasing  or decreasing)  a woman's  risk of developing  breast  cancer  \n(including  contralateral  disease  in women  already  diagnosed)  sufficient  to change  decision  \nmaking,  and of a magnitude  that \n• Management  changes  informed  by testing  can lead  to improved  health  outcomes.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nGenetic  testing  can be considered  for women  at increased  risk of developing  hereditary  breast  cancer  \nbased  on their  family  history  or in women  with  breast  cancer  whose  family  history  or cancer  \ncharacteristics  (e.g., triple -negative  disease,  young  age)  increase  the likelihood  that the breast  cancer  is \nhereditary.  Testing  may  also be considered  for women  from  families  with  known  variants.  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  for this review  are individuals  who  are undergoing  assessment  for \nHBOC  syndrome.  \nInterventions  \nThe intervention  of interest  is PALB2  variant  testing.  \nComparators  \nThe alternative  would  be to manage  women  at high -risk of HBOC  syndrome  with  no PALB2  genetic  \ntesting.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   16 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nOutcomes  \nThe outcomes  of interest  are OS, disease -specific  (breast  and ovarian  cancer)  survival,  and test validity.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of the clinical  validity  of the tests,  studies  that meet  the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Included  a suitable  reference  standard  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described  with  women  at high  breast  cancer  risk \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nSystematic  Reviews  \nSuszynska  et al (2019)  reported  a systematic  review  of variants  identified  in panels  of breast  and ovarian  \ncancer -related  genes.66, Results  were  reported  for PALB2 , CHEK2,  and ATM.  CHEK2  and ATM  results  will \nbe discussed  in the following  sections.  The systematic  review  included  studies  published  through  July \n2017  reporting  on genetic  test results  of breast  and ovarian  cancer  patients  who  were  referred  for \nevaluation  by a multi -gene  panel.  Given  that the Suszynska  et al (2019)  report  included  only  studies  \nreporting  on test results  from  a panel,  it does  not substantially  overlap  with  the studies  described  in the \nfollowing  section  including  other  PALB2  association  studies.  The studies  of panel  results  were  used  to \ncalculate  mutation  frequencies  by the gene.  As a control,  population  mutation  frequencies  were  \nextracted  from  the Genome  Aggregation  Database.  Forty -three  studies  included  panels  in breast  cancer  \npatients.  In the breast  cancer  studies,  95,853  patients  were  included  in the analysis  of PALB2 . PALB2  \nvariants  were  identified  in 0.9%  of breast  cancer  patients.  The meta -analytic  estimate  odds  ratio  (OR)  of \nthe association  between  PALB2  variants  and risk of breast  cancer  was 4.8 (95%   confidence interval [CI] , \n4.1 to 5.6).  \nObservational  Studies  \nA number  of studies  (Tables  4 and 5) reporting  relative  risks  (RRs)  or ORs for the association  between  \nPALB2  and breast  cancer  were  identified.18,17,19,20,67,68,69,70,71,72,73, Study  designs  included  family  \nsegregation67,74,, kin-cohort,17, family -based  case -control,19,69,75, and population -based  or multicenter  \ncase -control.18,20,68,70,71,72,73, The 2 multinational  studies  included  individuals  from  up to 5 of the single -\ncountry  studies.17,71, The number  of pathogenic  variants  identified  varied  from  1 (founder  mutations  \nexamined)  to 48 (Table  4). Studies  conducted  from  single -country  samples  are described  first followed  \nby the 2 multinational  collaborative  efforts.  \nSingle -Country  Samples  \nWoodward  et al (2021)  assessed  the contribution  of PALB2  gene  variants  to familial  breast  and ovarian  \ncancer.73, A total  of 3127  women  with  a histologically  confirmed  diagnosis  of invasive  or in situ breast  \ncancer  or an epithelial  nonmucinous  ovarian  cancer  who  had undergone  germline  testing  of BRCA1 , \nBRCA2 , PALB2 , and CHEK2 _c.1100delC  were  included.

Index  cases  were  identified  from  Familial  Cancer  Centers  and a Pathology  \ncenter  in Australia,  and controls  were  identified  from  the LifePool  mammography  screening  study.  \nLu et al (2019)  included  an analysis  of 11,416  patients  with  breast  cancer  and/or  ovarian  cancer  who  \nwere  referred  for genetic  testing  from  1200  U.S. hospitals  and clinics  and of 3988  controls  referred  for \ngenetic  testing  for noncancer  conditions  between  2014  and 2015.72, Whole -exome  sequencing  was used  \nand suspected  pathogenic  variants  in the breast  or ovarian  cancer -associated  genes  were  confirmed  by \nSanger  sequencing.  \nKurian  et al (2017)  reported  the association  between  pathogenic  variants  and breast  or ovarian  cancer  \nusing  a commercial  laboratory  database  of 95,561  women  tested  clinically  for hereditary  cancer  risk \nusing  a multi -gene  panel  that included  PALB2 , CHEK2 , and ATM .32, Although  the country  is not stated,  \nthe patients  underwent  testing  between  2013  and 2015  performed  at a Clinical  Laboratory  \nImprovement  Amendments  (CLIA)  laboratory  and,  thus,  will be assumed  to include  patients  from  the \nU.S. Cases  were  women  with  a single  diagnosis  of breast  or ovarian  cancer.  Controls  were  women  from  \nthe same  database  (i.e., being  tested  for hereditary  cancer)  with  no cancer  history  at the time  of genetic  \ntesting.  The multivariable  models  for breast  cancer  risk are reported  here.  Among  the breast  cancer  \npatients,  244 (0.92%)  had a PALB2  variant.  The association  between  PALB2  and breast  cancer  adjusting  \nfor age, ancestry,  personal  and family  cancer  histories,  and Lynch  and adenomatous  polyposis  colon  \ncancer  syndromes  had an OR of 3.39  (95%  CI, 2.79  to 4.12).  \nThompson  et al (2015)  evaluated  Australian  women  with  breast  cancer  (n=1996)  referred  for genetic  \nevaluation  from  1997  to 2014.70, A control  group  was accrued  from  participants  in the LifePool  study  \n(n=1998)  who  were  recruited  for a mammography  screening  program.  All PALB2  coding  exons  were  \nsequenced  by next -generation  sequencing  and novel  variants  verified  by Sanger  sequencing.  Large  \ndeletions  or rearrangements  were  not evaluated.  Nineteen  distinct  pathogenic  variants  were  identified,  \nincluding  6 not previously  described  in 26 (1.3%)  cases  and in 4 (0.2%)  controls  with  an odds  for breast  \ncancer  of 6.58  (95%  CI, 2.3 to 18.9).  Moreover,  54 missense  variants  identified  were  slightly  more  \ncommon  in cases  (OR,  1.15;  95%  CI, 1.02  to 1.32).  \nCybulski  et al (2015)  examined  2 loss-of-function  PALB2  variants  (c.509_510delGA,  c.172_175delTTGT)  in \nwomen  with  invasive  breast  cancer  diagnosed  between  1996  and 2012  in Poland.20, From  12,529  \ngenotyped  women,  a PALB2  variant  was identified  in 116 (0.93%)  cases  (95%  CI, 0.76%  to 1.09%)  versus  \n10 (0.21%  ; 95%  CI, 0.08%  to 0.34%)  of 4702  controls  (OR,  4.39;  95%  CI, 2.30  to 8.37).  A BRCA1  variant  \nwas identified  in 3.47%  of women  with  breast  cancer  and in 0.47%  of controls  (OR,  7.65;  95%  CI, 4.98  to \n11.75).  Authors  estimated  that a PALB2  sequence  variant  conferred  a 24%  cumulative  risk of breast  \ncancer  by age 75 years  (in the setting  of age-adjusted  breast  cancer  rates  slightly  more  than  half that in \nthe U.K.76, or the U.S.77,). A PALB2  variant  was also associated  with  poorer  prognosis:  10-year  survival  of \n48.0%  versus  74.7%  when  the variant  was absent  (HR adjusted  for prognostic  factors,  2.27;  95%  CI, 1.64  \nto 3.15).  \nCatucci  et al (2014)  performed  population -based  case -control  studies  in Italy  (Milan  or Bergamo)  among  \nwomen  at risk for hereditary  breast  cancer  and no BRCA1  or BRCA2  variant.18, In Milan,  9 different  \npathogenic  PALB2  variants  were  detected  in 12 of 575 cases  and none  in 784 controls  (blood  donor);  in \nBergamo,  PALB2  c.1027C>T  variants  were  detected  in 6 of 113 cases  and in 2 of 477 controls  (OR,  13.4;  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   18 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \n95%  CI, 2.7 to 67.4).  Performed  in 2 distinct  populations,  the combined  sample  size was small,  and \nuncertainty  existed  as indicated  by the large  effect  estimate.  \nCasadei  et al (2011)  studied  959 U.S. women  (non -Ashkenazi  Jewish  descent)  with  a family  history  of \nBRCA1 - or BRCA2 -negative  breast  cancer  and 83 female  relatives  using  a family -based  case -control  \ndesign.19, Using  conventional  sequencing,  pathogenic  PALB2  variants  were  detected  in 31 (3.2%)  women  \nwith  breast  cancer  and none  in controls.  Compared  with  their  female  relatives  without  PALB2  variants,  \nthe risk of breast  cancer  increased  2.3-fold (95%  CI, 1.5 to 4.2) by age 55 years  and 3.4-fold (95%  CI, 2.4 \nto 5.9) by age 85 years.  Mean  age at diagnosis  was not associated  with  the presence  of a variant  (50.0  \nyears  with  vs. 50.2  years  without).  Casadei  et al (2011)  provided  few details  of their  analyses.  \nAdditionally,  participants  reported  over  30 ancestries  and,  given  intermarriage  in the U.S. population,  \nstratification  may  have  had an impact  on results.  Generalizability  of the risk estimate  is therefore  \nunclear.  \nHeikkinen  et al (2009)  conducted  a population -based  case -control  study  at a Finnish  university  hospital  \nemploying  2 case  groups  (947  familial  and 1274  sporadic  breast  cancers)  and 1079  controls.68, The study  \nsample  was obtained  from  542 patients  with  familial  breast  cancer,  a series  of 884 oncology  patients  \n(79%  of consecutive  new  cases),  and 986 surgical  patients  (87%  of consecutive  new  cases);  1706  were  \ngenotyped  for the PALB2  c.1592delT  variant.  All familial  cases  were  BRCA1 - and BRCA2 -negative,  but \namong  controls,  there  were  183 BRCA  carriers.  PALB2  variant  prevalence  varied  with  family  history:  \n2.6%  when  3 or more  family  members  were  affected  and 0.7%  in all breast  cancer  patients.  Variant  \nprevalence  was 0.2%  among  controls.  In women  with  hereditary  disease,  a PALB2  c.1592delT  variant  \nwas associated  with  an increased  risk of breast  cancer  (OR,  11.0;  95%  CI, 2.65  to 97.78),  and was higher  \nin women  with  the strongest  family  histories  (women  with  sporadic  cancers;  OR, 4.19;  95%  CI, 1.52  to \n12.09).  Although  data  were  limited,  survival  was lower  among  PALB2 -associated  cases  (10-year  survival,  \n66.5%;  95%  CI, 44.0%  to 89.0%  vs. 84.2%;  95%  CI, 83.1%  to 87.1%  in women  without  a variant;  p=.041;  \nHR, 2.94;  p=.047).  A PALB2  variant  was also associated  with  triple -negative  tumors:  54.5%  versus  12.2%  \nwith  familial  disease  and 9.4%  in sporadic  cancers.  \nMultinational  Samples  \nYang  et al (2020)  performed  a complex  segregation  analysis  to estimate  relative  and absolute  risks  of \nbreast  cancer  from  data  on 524 families  with  PALB2  pathogenic  variants  from  21 countries,  the most  \nfrequent  being  c.3113G>A.74, Female  breast  cancer  (RR was 7.18  (95%  CI, 5.82  to 8.85;  p=6.5x10-75) when  \nassumed  to be constant  with  age.  The age-trend  model  provided  the best  fit (p=2x10-3) and \ndemonstrated  a pattern  of decreasing  RR with  each  increased  decade  in age.  The RR was 4.69  (95%  CI, \n3.28  to 6.70)  in those  75 years  of age per the age-trend  model.  \nSouthey  et al (2016)  examined  the association  of 3 PALB2  variants  (2 protein -truncating:  c.1592delT  and \nc.3113G>A;  1 missense  c.2816T>G)  with  breast,  prostate,  and ovarian  cancers.71, The association  with  \nbreast  cancer  was examined  among  participants  in the Breast  Cancer  Association  Consortium  (BCAC;  \n42,671  cases  and 42,164  controls).  The BCAC  (part  of the larger  Collaborative  Oncological  Gene -\nenvironment  Study)  included  48 separate  studies  with  participants  of multiple  ethnicities,  but mainly  \nEuropean,  Asian,  and African  American.  Most  studies  were  population - or hospital -based  case -controls  \nwith  some  oversampling  cases  with  family  histories  or bilateral  disease.  A custom  array  was used  for \ngenotyping  at 4 centers,  with  2% duplicate  samples.  The ORs were  estimated  adjusting  for study  among  \nall participants,  and excluding  those  studies  selecting  patients  based  on family  history  or bilateral  \ndisease  (37,039  cases,  38,260  controls).  The c.1592delT  variant  was identified  in 35 cases  and 6 controls  \n(from  4 studies  in the U.K.,  Australia,  U.S.,  Canada;  OR, 4.52;  95%  CI, 1.90  to 10.8;  p<.001);  in those  with  \nno family  history  or bilateral  disease  (OR,  3.44;  95%  CI, 1.39  to 8.52;  p=.003).

These  results,  derived  from  a large  sample,  used  a different  analytic  approach  than  \nAntoniou  et al (2014),  described  next,  and examined  only  2 pathogenic  variants.  The magnitude  of the \nestimated  RR approaches  that of a high  penetrance  gene  but is accompanied  by wide  CIs owing  to the \nstudy  design  and low carrier  prevalence.  The lower  estimates  obtained  following  exclusion  of those  \nselected  based  on family  history  or bilateral  disease  are consistent  with  the importance  of carefully  \nconsidering  the risk of hereditary  disease  prior  to genetic  testing.  \nAntoniou  et al (2014)  analyzed  data  from  362 members  of 154 families  with  deleterious  PALB2  \nvariants.17, Individuals  with  benign  variants  or variants  of uncertain  significance  were  excluded.  Families  \nwere  recruited  at 14 centers  in 8 countries  (U.S.,  U.K.,  Finland,  Greece,  Australia,  Canada,  Belgium,  Italy)  \nand had at least  1 member  with  a BRCA1 - or BRCA2 -negative  PALB2 -positive  breast  cancer.  There  were  \n311 women  with  PALB2  variants:  229 had breast  cancer;  51 men  also had PALB2  variants  (7 had breast  \ncancer).  Of the 48 pathogenic  (loss -of-function)  variants  identified,  2 were  most  common  (c.1592delT  in \n44 families,  c.3113G>A  in 25 families);  39 of the 48 pathogenic  variants  were  found  in just 1 or 2 \nfamilies.  Carriers  of PALB2  variants  (men  and women)  had a 9.47 -fold increased  risk for breast  cancer  \n(95%  CI, 7.16  to 12.57)  compared  with  the U.K. population  under  a single -gene  model  and age-constant  \nRR; 30%  of tumors  were  triple -negative.  For a woman  aged  50 to 54 years,  the estimated  RR was 6.55  \n(95%  CI, 4.60  to 9.18).  The RR of breast  cancer  for males  with  PALB2  variants,  compared  with  the male  \nbreast  cancer  incidence  in the general  population,  was 8.3 (95%  CI, 0.77  to 88.5;  p=.08).  The cumulative  \nrisk at age 50 years  of breast  cancer  for female  PALB2  carriers  without  considering  family  history  was \n14%  (95%  CI, 9% to 20%);  by age 70 years,  it was 35%  (95%  CI, 26%  to 46%).  A family  history  of breast  \ncancer  increased  the cumulative  risk. If a woman  with  a PALB2  variant  has a sister  and mother  who  had \nbreast  cancer  at age 50 years,  by age 50 years  she would  have  a 27%  (95%  CI, 21%  to 33%)  estimated  \nrisk of developing  breast  cancer;  and by age 70 years,  a 58%  (95%  CI, 50%  to 66%)  risk. These  results  \nemphasize  that family  history  affects  penetrance.  Authors  noted  that the study  \"includes  most  of the \nreported  families  with  PALB2  variant  carriers,  as well as many  not previously  reported\".  \nTable  4.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nEvidence  of clinical  utility  limited  to women  with  PALB2  variants  was not identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nRosenthal  et al (2017)  reported  an analysis  of the impact  of testing  for genes  other  than  BRCA1 /2 and by \ncalculating  whether  carriers  of these  gene  variants  would  have  been  identified  as candidates  for \nenhanced  screening  based  on family  history  alone.78, The database  included  194,107  women  who  were  \ntested  using  a hereditary  cancer  panel  between  2013  and 2016.  The women  were  referred  by their  \nhealth  care  providers  for clinical  suspicion  of hereditary  cancer.  It is unclear  what  proportion  of the \nwomen  met professional  society  criteria  for genetic  testing  for breast  cancer  risk; baseline  information  \nregarding  family  history  was not reported.  Of the women  in the database,  893 had PALB2  variants  and \nwere  eligible  for Claus  assessment  to estimate  the risk of breast  cancer.  Approximately  27%  of women  \nwith  PALB2  variants  would  have  had an estimated  risk of breast  cancer  of 20%  or higher  based  on the \nClaus  model.  The report  did not include  health  outcomes  and it is unclear  whether  enhanced  screening  \nin women  who  had a moderate  penetrance  variant  but did not have  an estimated  risk of breast  cancer  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   25 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nof 20%  or greater  based  on the Claus  model  would  have  improved  health  outcomes  from  enhanced  \nsurveillance.  \nStudies  of women  at high -risk based  on family  history  alone  or in those  with  BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  \nare relevant  to the clinical  utility  of PALB2  testing  given  the penetrance  estimates  for PALB2  and related  \nmolecular  mechanism  (\"BRCA -ness\").  Interventions  to decrease  breast  cancer  risk in asymptomatic  high -\nrisk women  include  screening79, (e.g., starting  at an early  age, the addition  of magnetic  resonance  \nimaging  to mammography,  and screening  annually),  chemoprevention,80, and prophylactic  \nmastectomy.81, In women  with  breast  cancer,  contralateral  prophylactic  mastectomy  is of interest;  other  \ntreatment  decisions  are dictated  by clinical,  pathologic,  and other  prognostic  factors.  \nIn women  at high -risk of hereditary  breast  cancer,  including  BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers,  evidence  \nsupports  a reduction  in subsequent  breast  cancer  after  bilateral  or contralateral  prophylactic  \nmastectomy.  Decision  analyses  have  also concluded  the impact  on breast  cancer  incidence  extends  life \nin high,  but not average  risk,82, women.  For example,  Schrag  et al (1997,  2000)  modeled  the impact  of \npreventive  interventions  in women  with  BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants  and examined  penetrance  \nmagnitudes  similar  to those  estimated  for a PALB2  variant.83,84, Compared  with  surveillance,  a 30-year -\nold BRCA  carrier  with  an expected  40%  risk of breast  cancer  and 5% risk of ovarian  cancer  by age 70 \nyears  would  gain  an expected  2.9 years  following  a prophylactic  mastectomy  alone  and an additional  0.3 \nyears  with  a prophylactic  oophorectomy  (Table  8).83, A 50-year -old female  BRCA  carrier  with  node -\nnegative  breast  cancer  and a 24%  risk of contralateral  breast  cancer  at age 70 years  would  anticipate  0.9 \nyears  in improved  life expectancy  (0.6 years  for node -negative  disease)  following  a prophylactic  \ncontralateral  mastectomy.84, \nTable  8.

While  \nestimates  of the magnitude  of the association  between  PALB2  and breast  cancer  risk varied  across  \nstudies,  their  magnitudes  are of moderate  to high  penetrance.  \nOf interest  is how  variant  detection  affects  penetrance  estimates  compared  with  family  history  alone.  As \nwith  BRCA  variants,  model -based  estimates  allow  estimating  risks  for individual  patient  and family  \ncharacteristics.  To illustrate  using  the Breast  and Ovarian  Analysis  of Disease  Incidence  and Carrier  \nEstimation  Algorithm  model,  a woman  age 30 years  whose  mother  had breast  cancer  at age 35 years  has \nan estimated  14.4%  risk of breast  cancer  at age 70 years.  If she carries  a PALB2  variant,  the risk increases  \nto 51.1%.  A woman,  age 50 years,  with  breast  cancer  whose  mother  had breast  cancer  at age 50 years,  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   26 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nhas an estimated  11.7%  risk of contralateral  cancer  by age 70 years,  increasing  to 28.7%  if she carries  a \nPALB2  variant.  \nEvidence  concerning  preventive  interventions  in women  with  PALB2  variants  is indirect,  relying  on \nstudies  of high -risk women  and BRCA  carriers.  In women  at high -risk of hereditary  breast  cancer  who  \nwould  consider  preventive  interventions,  identifying  a PALB2  variant  provides  a more  accurate  \nestimated  risk of developing  breast  cancer  compared  with  family  history  alone  and can offer  a better  \nunderstanding  of benefits  and potential  harms  of interventions.  \nSummary  of Evidence  \nFor individuals  who  have  cancer  or a personal  or family  cancer  history  and meet  criteria  suggesting  a risk \nof hereditary  breast  and ovarian  cancer  (HBOC)  syndrome  who  receive  genetic  testing  for a BRCA1  or \nBRCA2  variant,  the evidence  includes  a TEC Assessment  and studies  of variant  prevalence  and cancer  \nrisk. Relevant  outcomes  are overall  survival  (OS),  disease -specific  survival,  test validity,  and quality  of life \n(QOL).  The accuracy  of variant  testing  has been  shown  to be high.  Studies  of lifetime  risk of cancer  for \ncarriers  of a BRCA  variant  have  shown  a risk as high  as 85%.  Knowledge  of BRCA  variant  status  in \nindividuals  at risk of a BRCA  variant  may  impact  health  care  decisions  to reduce  risk, including  intensive  \nsurveillance,  chemoprevention,  and/or  prophylactic  intervention.  In individuals  with  BRCA1  or BRCA2  \nvariants,  prophylactic  mastectomy  and oophorectomy  have  been  found  to significantly  increase  disease -\nspecific  survival  and OS. Knowledge  of BRCA  variant  status  in individuals  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer  \nmay  impact  treatment  decisions.  The evidence  is sufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in \nan improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  have  other  high -risk cancers  (e.g., cancers  of the fallopian  tube,  pancreas,  prostate)  \nwho  receive  genetic  testing  for a BRCA1  or BRCA2  variant,  the evidence  includes  studies  of variant  \nprevalence  and cancer  risk. Relevant  outcomes  are OS, disease -specific  survival,  test validity,  and QOL.  \nThe accuracy  of variant  testing  has been  shown  to be high.  Knowledge  of BRCA  variant  status  in \nindividuals  with  other  high -risk cancers  can inform  decisions  regarding  genetic  counseling,  \nchemotherapy,  and enrollment  in clinical  trials.  The evidence  is sufficient  to determine  that the \ntechnology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  with  a risk of HBOC  syndrome  who  receive  genetic  testing  for a PALB2  variant,  the \nevidence  includes  studies  of clinical  validity  and studies  of breast  cancer  risk, including  a meta -analysis.  \nRelevant  outcomes  are OS, disease -specific  survival,  and test validity.  Evidence  supporting  clinical  \nvalidity  was obtained  from  numerous  studies  reporting  RRs or ORs.  Study  designs  included  family  \nsegregation,  kin-cohort,  family -based  case -control,  and population -based  case -control.  The number  of \npathogenic  variants  identified  in studies  varied  from  1 (founder  mutations)  to 48. The relative  risk for \nbreast  cancer  associated  with  a PALB2  variant  ranged  from  2.3 to 13.4,  with  the 2 family -based  studies  \nreporting  the lowest  values.  Evidence  of preventive  interventions  in women  with  PALB2  variants  is \nindirect,  relying  on studies  of high -risk women  and BRCA  carriers.  These  interventions  include  screening  \nwith  magnetic  resonance  imaging,  chemoprevention,  and risk-reducing  mastectomy.  Given  the \npenetrance  of PALB2  variants,  the outcomes  following  bilateral  and contralateral  risk-reducing  \nmastectomy  examined  in women  with  a family  history  consistent  with  hereditary  breast  cancer  \n(including  BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers)  can be applied  to women  with  PALB2  variants,  with  the benefit -to-\nrisk balance  affected  by penetrance.  In women  at high -risk of hereditary  breast  cancer  who  would  \nconsider  risk-reducing  interventions,  identifying  a PALB2  variant  provides  a more  precise  estimated  risk \nof developing  breast  cancer  compared  with  family  history  alone  and can offer  women  a more  accurate  \nunderstanding  of benefits  and potential  harms  of any intervention.  The evidence  is sufficient  to \ndetermine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   27 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nSUPPLEMENTAL  INFORMATION  \nThe purpose  of the following  information  is to provide  reference  material.  Inclusion  does  not imply  \nendorsement  or alignment  with  the evidence  review  conclusions.  \nClinical  Input  From  Physician  Specialty  Societies  and Academic  Medical  Centers  \nWhile  the various  physician  specialty  societies  and academic  medical  centers  may  collaborate  with  and \nmake  recommendations  during  this process,  through  the provision  of appropriate  reviewers,  input  \nreceived  does  not represent  an endorsement  or position  statement  by the physician  specialty  societies  \nor academic  medical  centers,  unless  otherwise  noted.  \n2010  Input  \nIn response  to requests,  input  was received  for 3 physician  specialty  societies  (5 reviewers)  and 3 \nacademic  medical  centers  (5 reviewers)  while  this policy  was under  review  in 2010.  Those  providing  \ninput  were  in general  agreement  with  the Policy  statements  considering  testing  for genomic  \nrearrangements  of BRCA1  and BRCA2  as medically  necessary  and with  adding  fallopian  tube  and primary  \nperitoneal  cancer  as BRCA -associated  malignancies  to assess  when  obtaining  the family  history.  \nPractice  Guidelines  and Position  Statements  \nGuidelines  or position  statements  will be considered  for inclusion  in ‘Supplemental  Information'  if they  \nwere  issued  by, or jointly  by, a US professional  society,  an international  society  with  US representation,  \nor National  Institute  for Health  and Care  Excellence  (NICE).  Priority  will be given  to guidelines  that are \ninformed  by a systematic  review,  include  strength  of evidence  ratings,  and include  a description  of \nmanagement  of conflict  of interest.  \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology  \nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in \npatients with breast cancer.85, The guideline recommends  BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with \nbreast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65 years (including \nthose who are eligible for poly -ADP ribose polymerase [PARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history \nof breast cancer may also be candidates for  BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their \npersonal and family risk. Testing for other high -penetrance genes (ie,  PALB2 , TP53 , PTEN , STK11 , \nand CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.  \nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer. Genes with \na strong testing recommendation are those that confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For \nbreast cancer, the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in multigene panels \nare: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK11 , and  TP53 . Of these,  CDH1 , PTEN , STK11 , and  TP53  are \nassociated with specific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not \nsuggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial ovarian cancer, the more strongly \nrecommended genes are:  BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , \nand RAD51D . Testing for  BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma and prostate cancer, and testing for  PALB2  is strongly recommended for pancreatic \nadenocarcinoma. The authors note including  BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and Lynch syndrome genes \n(ie, MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and  EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is \nreasonable due to their importance and prevalence.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   28 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nNational  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  \nBreast  Cancer  and Ovarian  Cancer  \nCurrent  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (NCCN)  (v.3.202 4) guidelines  on the genetic  and \nfamilial  high -risk assessment  of breast,  ovarian,  and pancreatic  cancers  include  criteria  for identifying  \nindividuals  who  should  be referred  for further  risk assessment  and separate  criteria  for genetic  \ntesting.85, Patients  who  satisfy  any of the testing  criteria  listed  in CRIT -1 through  CRIT -4 should  undergo  \n“further  personalized  risk assessment,  genetic  counseling,  and often  genetic  testing  and management.”  \nFor these  criteria,  both  invasive  and in situ breast  cancers  were  included.  Maternal  and paternal  sides  of \nthe family  should  be considered  independently  for familial  patterns  of cancer.  Testing  of unaffected  \nindividuals  should  be considered  \"when  no appropriate  affected  family  member  is available  for testing.”  \nThe recommendations  are for testing  high  penetrance  breast  cancer  susceptibility  genes,  specifically  \nBRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN , STK11  and TP53 . Use of \"tailored  panels  that are disease -focused  \nand include  clinically  actionable  cancer  susceptibility  genes  is preferred  over  large  panels  that include  \ngenes  of uncertain  clinical  relevance\".  \nThe panel  does  not endorse  population  based  testing,  stating  instead  that the panel,  \"continues  to \nendorse  a risk-stratified  approach  and does  not endorse  universal  testing  of all patients  with  breast  \ncancer  due to limitations  of this approach,  such  as low specificity,  shortages  in trained  genetics  health  \nprofessionals  to provide  appropriate  pre- and post -test genetic  counseling,  and lack of evidence  to \nsupport  risk management  for genes  included  in many  multi -gene  panels.\"  \nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic  only  variants  are uncommon.  The NCCN  recommends  if a somatic  variant  is \nidentified  through  tumor  profiling,  then  BRCA1  and BRCA2  germline  testing  is recommended.  \nAdditionally,  the NCCN  ovarian  cancer  guidelines  (v.2.202 4) recommend  tumor  molecular  testing  for \npersistent/recurrent  disease  (OV-6) and describe  in multiple  algorithms  that testing  should  include  at \nleast  BRCA1 /2, homologous  recombination,  microsatellite  instability,  tumor  mutational  burden,  and \nneurotrophic  tyrosine  receptor  kinase  , (OV-6, OV-7, OV-B Principles  of Pathology,  OV-C Principles  of \nSystemic  Therapy).86, \nPancreatic  Adenocarcinoma  and Pancreatic  Neuroendocrine  Tumors  \nCurrent  NCCN  guidelines  for pancreatic  adenocarcinoma  (v.2.202 4) refers  to the NCCN  guidelines  on \ngenetic/familial  high -risk assessment  of breast,  ovarian,  and pancreatic  cancers  detailed  above,  and \nstate:  “The  panel  recommends  germline  testing  in any patient  with  confirmed  pancreatic  cancer  and in \nthose  in whom  there  is a clinical  suspicion  for inherited  susceptibility.\"  The panel  recommends\"using  \ncomprehensive  gene  panels  for hereditary  cancer  syndromes.\"87, \nThe NCCN  guidelines  for genetic  and familial  high -risk assessment  of breast,  ovarian,  and pancreatic  \ncancers  (v.3.202 4) includes  that germline  testing  is clinically  indicated  for individuals  with  \nneuroendocrine  pancreatic  cancers  per the NCCN  guidelines  on neuroendocrine  and adrenal  tumors.88, \nThe NCCN  guidelines  for neuroendocrine  and adrenal  tumors  (v.1.202 4) states,  \"consider  genetic  risk \nevaluation  and genetic  testing:  In a patient  with  duodenal/pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumor  at any \nage\",  noting,  \"studies  of unselected  patients  with  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumors  have  identified  \ngermline  variants  in 16% -17%  of cases.  However,  these  studies  involved  relatively  small  cohorts  of \npatients.\"  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  July 1997   Page:   29 \n  \n  MP 2.04.02  \nGermline  Genetic  Testing  for Hereditary  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer  Syndrome  and Other  High -Risk  Cancers  \n(BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 ) \n \nProstate  Cancer  \nThe current  NCCN  guidelines  for prostate  cancer  are version  1.202 4.89, The Principles  of Genetics  and \nMolecular/Biomarker  Analysis  section  (PROS -C ) provides  appropriate  scenarios  for germline  genetic  \ntesting  in individuals  with  a personal  history  of prostate  cancer.  \nAmerican  Society  of Breast  Surgeons  \nA consensus  guideline  on genetic  testing  for hereditary  breast  cancer  was updated  in February  2019.90, \nThe guideline  states  that genetic  testing  should  be made  available  to all patients  with  a personal  history  \nof breast  cancer  and that such  testing  should  include  BRCA1 /BRCA2  and PALB2 , with  other  genes  as \nappropriate  for the clinical  scenario  and patient  family  history.  Furthermore,  patients  who  had previous  \ngenetic  testing  may  benefit  from  updated  testing.  Finally,  genetic  testing  should  be made  available  to \npatients  without  a personal  history  of breast  cancer  when  they  meet  NCCN  guideline  criteria.  The \nguidelines  also note  that variants  of uncertain  significance  are not clinically  actionable.  \nSociety  of Gynecologic  Oncology  \nIn 2015,  the Society  of Gynecologic  Oncology  (SGO)  published  an evidence -based  consensus  statement  \non risk assessment  for inherited  gynecologic  cancer.91, The statement  included  criteria  for \nrecommending  genetic  assessment  (counseling  with  or without  testing)  to patients  who  may  be \ngenetically  predisposed  to breast  or ovarian  cancer.  Overall,  the SGO  and the NCCN  recommendations  \nare very  similar;  the main  differences  are the exclusion  of women  with  breast  cancer  onset  at age 50 \nyears  or younger  who  have  1 or more  first-, second -, or third -degree  relatives  with  breast  cancer  at any \nage;  women  with  breast  cancer  or history  of breast  cancer  who  have  a first-, second -, or third -degree  \nmale  relative  with  breast  cancer;  and men  with  a personal  history  of breast  cancer.  Additionally,  SGO  \nrecommended  genetic  assessment  for unaffected  women  who  have  a male  relative  with  breast  cancer.  \nMoreover,  SGO  indicated  that some  patients  who  do not satisfy  criteria  may  still benefit  from  genetic  \nassessment  (e.g., few female  relatives,  hysterectomy,  or oophorectomy  at a young  age in multiple  family  \nmembers,  or adoption  in the lineage).  \nAmerican  College  of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists  \nThe American  College  of Obstetricians  and Gynecologists  (2017,  reaffirmed  2021  ) published  a Practice  \nBulletin  on hereditary  breast  and ovarian  cancer  syndrome.92, The following  recommendation  was based  \nprimarily  on consensus  and expert  opinion  (level  C): “Genetic  testing  is recommended  when  the results  \nof a detailed  risk assessment  that is performed  as part of genetic  counseling  suggest  the presence  of an \ninherited  cancer  syndrome  for which  specific  genes  have  been  identified  and when  the results  of testing  \nare likely  to influence  medical  management.”  \nU.S. Preventive  Services  Task  Force  \nCurrent  U.S. Preventative  Services  Task  Force  (USPSTF)  recommendations  (2019)93, for genetic  testing  of \nBRCA1  and BRCA2  variants  in women  state:  \n\"The  USPSTF  recommends  that primary  care  clinicians  assess  women  with  a personal  or family  history  of \nbreast,  ovarian,  tubal,  or peritoneal  cancer  or who  have  an ancestry  associated  with  BRCA1 /2 gene  \nmutation  with  an appropriate  brief  familial  risk assessment  tool.  Women  with  a positive  result  on the \nrisk assessment  tool should  receive  genetic  counseling  and,  if indicated  after  counseling,  genetic  testing  \n(B recommendation).  The USPSTF  recommends  against  routine  risk assessment,  genetic  counseling,  or \ngenetic  testing  for women  whose  personal  or family  history  or ancestry  is not associated  with  potentially  \nharmful  BRCA1 /2 gene  mutations.

The most common test used to determine CVD risk is \nthe lipid profile, which measures cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C), low-density \nlipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) and triglycerides .  \n Panels beyond the basic lipid profile are commercially available and may include analysis of genetic markers for CVD risk including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) genotyping and often pharmacogenomics tests. SNP genotype testing has been proposed to  identify an individual at risk for atrial fibrillation (AF), \ncoronary artery disease and early myocardial infarctio n (MI). Examples include but may not be limited to:  \n\n\nGenetic Testing for Cardiac Conditions  \nPage: 2 of 18 \n \n \n• 4q25 genotype testing (eg, 4q25 -AF Risk Genotype Test, Cardio IQ 4q25 -AF Risk Genotype Test)  (Refer to \nCoverage Limitations section)  \n \n• 9p21 genotype testing (eg, Cardio IQ 9p21 Genotype Test)  (Refer to Coverage Limitations section)  \n \n• LPA Intron -25 genotype testing (eg, Cardio IQ LPA Intron -25 Genotype Test, LPA -Intron 25 Genotype \nTest ) (Refer to Coverage Limitations section)  \n \n• Multianalyte DNA analysis of SNPs reported as a risk score for a CVD event ( eg, CardoRisk+,  Epi+GenCHD  \nand PrecisionCHD) (Refer to Coverage Limitations section)  \n \n• ST2 (growth stimulation expressed gene 2) (eg, Cardio IQ ST2) (Refer to Coverage Limitations section)  \n \nCVD risk panels  may also include genetic tests to determine an individual’s susceptibility for \nhypercoagulation or thrombosis, which has been proposed as a risk factor for CVD. Testing may include \nfactor II (F2 gene), factor V (F5  gene) or plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI -1). (Refer to Coverage \nLimitations section)   \n Health and wellness SNP genotyping tests  are also commercially available to analyze genes associated with \nvarious wellness factors, such as diet, exercise and metabolism, to purportedly guide  an individual to \npersonalized lifestyle choices to improve overall health and wellbeing. These tests may also be marketed to improve CVD risk by choosing a diet or exercise regimen based on an individual’s genetic makeup. Examples of these tests include but may not be limited to: Cardiac Healthy Weight DNA Insight, Healthy Woman DNA \nInsight . (Refer to Covera ge Limitations section)  \n Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies  \nCardiomyopathy is a chronic disease of the myocardium  (heart muscle ). The heart muscle becomes \nenlarged, thick or rigid , resulting in a failure to pump blood effectively, which can lead to arrhythmias \n(irregular heartbeats) and possible  heart failure.  Cardiomyopathy can be acquired or inherited. \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is one of the main types of cardiomyopathy.  \n \nCardiac ion channelopathies are a group of diseases that develop due to defects in ion channels and can be \ncaused by either genetic or acquired factors. Inherited cardiac channelopathies include, but are not limited to, Brugada syndrome (BrS), catecholamin ergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and long QT \nsyndrome (LQTS).  \n \nGenetic testing may be used to detect variants believed to be linked to inherited cardiomyopathies and \nchannelopathies to assist with diagnosis, determine prognosis and identify susceptibility in at- risk, \nunaffected family  members.  \n \nA variety of multigene panel tests , with or without next -generation sequencing (NGS) technology, that \nsimultaneously analyze many genes at one time are currently commercially available. Targeted multigene \npanels  examine only those genes associated with a given disease.  \n \n\nGenetic Testing for Cardiac Conditions  \nPage: 3 of 18 \n \nMulticondition multigene panels  are also available to analyze a broader range of genes associated with a \ngroup of diseases  (eg, inherited channelopathies ). In this example , the panel may target genes for all \ninheri ted channelopathies including BrS , CPVT and LQTS. (Refer to Coverage Limitations section)  \n \nFinally, what can be termed as comprehensive multigene panels  offer analysis of an even broader range of \ngenes and include those associated with both inherited cardiomyopathies and channelopathies. (Refer to Coverage Limitations section)  \n Examples of multicondition and comprehensive multigene panels include, but may not be limited to:  \n \n• Arrhythmia Panel  \n• AtheroGxOne  \n• Cardiomyopathies Del/Dup Panel  \n• Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmia Panel  \n• Cardiomyopathy Panel  \n• CardioNext  \n• CMNext  \n• Combined Cardiac Panel  \n• Comprehensive Cardiomyopathy Multi -Gene Panel  \n• DCMNext  \n• GeneSeq: Cardio Familial Arrhythmia Panel  \n• GeneSeq: Cardio Familial Cardiomyopathy Profile  \n• Genomic Unity Cardiac Ion Channelopathies Analysis  (0237U)  \n• HCMNext  \n• Invitae Arrhythmia and Cardiomyopathy Comprehensive Panel  \n• Invitae Arrhythmia Comprehensive Panel  \n• Invitae Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy Panel  \n• Invitae Cardiomyopathy Comprehensive Panel  \n• Invitae Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Panel  \n• LongQTNext  \n• Pan Cardiomyopathy Panel \n• RhythmNext  \n Familial Hypercholesterolemia  \nFamilial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic (autosomal dominant) disorder. Gene variants can inhibit \nthe liver from metabolizing excess  low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C), resulting in lifelong exposure \nto elevated LDL -C levels which contributes to premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.  \n There are two  forms of FH including heterozygous  FH (HeFH) (single gene variant received from one parent) \nand homozygous FH (HoFH) (more than one variant  received from one or both parents). HeFH is the most \ncommon form and is found in approximately 1:250 individuals. HoFH is rare, occurring in approximately \n1:350,000 individuals, but can have an earlier onset with more severe outcomes .\n60 \n \n \nCoverage Determination  \n \n\nGenetic Testing for Cardiac Conditions  \nPage: 4 of 18 \n \nAny state mandates for genetic testing for cardiac conditions take precedence over this medical coverage \npolicy .  \n Genetic testing may be excluded by c ertificate .

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

While specific features vary by type, an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility) and cardiovascular disease (such as thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections) are features that are present in many hereditary connective tissue disorders.    Medical management may differ based \non the underlying genetic etiology. A diagnosis may be made based on clinical examination; \nhowever, it can be difficult to reliably diagnose a hereditary connective tissue disorder based on \nclinical and family history alone. \nAccurate diagnosis of a hereditary connective tissue disorder can lead to changes in clinical \nmanagement, including surveillance of the aorta, surgical repair of the aorta, when necessary, pharmacologic management, as well as surveillance for multisystem involvement in syndromic \nconditions with risk for thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissection. \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria section.

Oftentimes, the best way to find the genetic cause is to start by testing someone in the family who is known or strongly suspected to have the disease. If their testing is positive, then we can say that we have found the familial pathogenic (harmful) variant. We can use this as a marker to test other members /enrollees \nof the family to see who is also at risk. \nComprehensive Connective Tissue Disorders Multigene Panel \nGeneReviews: Classic Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome \nGeneReviews is an expert -authored review of current literature on a genetic disease, and goes \nthrough a rigorous editing and peer review process before being published online.

Testing for \nvEDS should also be considered in the presence of a combination of the other “minor” clinical features listed above. Even for experienced clinicians the clinical diagnosis of vEDS may be difficult . Because of implications for treatment, natural \nhistory, and recurrence risk, the diagnosis of vEDS rests on the identification of a causative variant in one allele of COL3A1 . \nPatients with vEDS typically harbor a heterozygous variant in the COL3A1  gene, \nencoding type III collagen, with the rare exception of specific heterozygous variants in COL1A1 . Verification of clinical diagnosis via Molecular screening by \nSanger sequencing of COL3A1 , or targeted resequencing of a gene panel that \nincludes COL3A1 and CO L1A1  is indicated. When no variant is identified, this \napproach should be complemented with a CNV detection strategy to identify large deletions or duplications. \n18 \n\n \n    \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n     \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n   \n  \n   \n \n  \n  \n Concert Genetics Genetic Testing: Aortopathies and Connective Tissue Disorders  \nV2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023  \nHypermobile Ehlers -Danlos syndrome \nGeneReviews \nGeneReviews is an expert -authored review of cu rrent literature on a genetic disease, and goes \nthrough a rigorous editing and peer review process before being published online. \nGeneReviews for Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) (Levy, 2018) states that \ndiagnosis of hEDS is based entirely on clinical evaluation and family history.

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results.

Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from \nfamilies with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations \nare more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for \nthese specific mutations.\"\nNote  This benefit/harm statement only applies to those jurisdictions that do not have \nMedicare guidance. Based upon the guidelines and evidence provided in the clinical \npolicy, following EviCore's criteria for BRCA analysis will ensure that testing will be \navailable to those members most likely to benefit from a genetic diagnosis. For those \nnot meeting criteria, it ensures alternate diagnostic strategies are considered. \nHowever, it is possible that some members who have the condition, but have non-\nstandard features, will not receive an immediate approval for testing.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Scientific Background  \nGene  mutations  are referred  to as “germline”  if they  are within gametes  (ova  and sperm) . Therefore,  \nthese  mutations  may  be passed  on from  parent  to offspring.  There  are many  different  types  of germline  \nmutations,  such as single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs),  structural  variations  such  as deletions,  \ninversions,  or translocations,  as well as smaller  chromosomal  abnormalities  such as short  tandem  repeats,  \nor gene  fusions. M utations  may  not necessarily  result  in disease.  \nSNPs  are the most  common  type  of genetic  mutation,  such  as missense  mutations.  These mutations  are \nsingle  base -pair changes  where  one nucleotide  is replaced  with  a different  nucleotide . Millions  of \nindividual  SNPs  have  been  identified  through  genome -wide  association  studies,  with  approximately  4000  \nSNPs  with  potential  association  with  disease . Insertion/deletion  (indel)  polymorphisms  are often  a single  \nnucleotide  but may  be up to four nucleotides.  SNPs  often  lead  to frameshift  mutations,  which  can cause  \npremature  stop  codons  and the failure  of the allele . \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 4 of 10 \nStructural variations  are usually  classified  as larger than  1000 base  pairs. These  include  deletions,  \nduplications,  inversions,  translocations,  or ring chromosome  formation.  Due to the large  number  of bases  \naffected,  these  variations  may  lead  to severe  genetic  abnormalities.  For example,  a major cause  of \nDuchenne  muscular  dystrophy  is the deletion  of large  portions  of exons  (coding  portions  of genes) . The \nmost  common  structural  variation  is the copy  number  variant  (CNV),  which  refers  to differing  amounts  of \nDNA  segments  in different  individuals.  For example,  one person  may  have  three  copies  of a specific  \nsegment  whereas  another  may  only  have  two.  These variations  may  lead  to dysregulation,  gain-of-\nfunction,  or loss-of-function  of the affected  genes.  The sensitive  genes  that require  or produce  precise  \namounts  of a protein  product  tend  to suffer more  from  these  variations. \nGermline  mutations  are unique  in that the risk for certain  conditions , including  many  forms  of cancer , \nmay  be passed  from  parent  to offspring. Testing  for these conditions  will often  involve  testing  entire  \nfamilies  if one member  is found to have  a germline  mutation ; for example,  the National Comprehensive  \nCancer  Network  (NCCN ) guidelines  for hereditary  cancer  recommend  testing  for BRCA 1/2, CDH1,  PALB2,  \nPTEN  and TP53  mutations  if any blood  relative  has a known or likely  pathogenic  variant  in a cancer  \nsusceptibility  gene . Wilson  e t  al. (2020)  estimate  that 21,800 adult  survivors  of childhood  cancer in the \nUnited  States  carry  a pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variant  in one of 156 cancer  predisposition  genes.  \n \nOther  types  of mutations  are unique  to germline  mutations.  Errors  in chromosome  number  (aneuploidy)  \nare typically  caused  by non- disjunctions  in meiosis, causing  either  a monosomic  (one  chromosome)  or a \ntrisomic  (three  chromosomes)  set of chromosomes.  Some  aneuploidies , trisomy  21, or Down  Syndrome , \nbeing  most  notable , are compatible  with  life. Aneuploidies  may  also result  with  sex chromosomes,  \nresulting  in conditions  such as Turner’s  Syndrome  (one  X chromosome)  or Klinefelter’s  Syndrome  (XXY).  \nAny size mutation  may  be pathogenic  and must  be classified  as to how  likely  they  are to cause  disease. \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  (ACMG ) has classified  mutations  in five \ncategories,  which  are as follows:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  uncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and \nbenign.  The “likely  pathogenic”  and “likely  benign”  refer to weaker  evidence  than  their  respective  \npathogenic  and benign categories,  and “uncertain  significance”  refers  to evidence  that does  not meet  \ncriteri a for benignity  or pathogenicity  or has conflicting  evidence  from  both  sides.  Prediction  algorithms  \nhave  been used to interpret  variants  and to predict  whether  a variant  will affect  the gene  function or \nsplicing  of the gene.  These  algorithms  are publicly  available  but have  a tendency  of predicting  harmful \nimpact  of a variant.  The specificity  of these  databases  has been estimated  at 60-80%.  \nDue to t he  enormous  number  of variants,  as well as the rate that variants  are discovered,  comprehensive  \ndatabases  of genetic  variants  have  been published and are easily  available. For example,  the Haplotype  \nReference  Consortium  contains  over  40 million  identified  SNPs . Databases  focusing on cancer -specific  \nvariants,  reference  sequences , and the general  population  are all available  publicly.   \nFor many  years,  single -gene  testing  was the standard  approach  for germline  mutation  testing.  In recent  \nyears,  multigene  panel  testing  (MGPT)  has been introduced and widely  accepted  as the first-tier test.  \nMGPT  increases  the probability  of identifying  pathogenic  mutations  and represents  an affordable  \napplication  of next -generation sequencing  (NGS)  into clinical practice.  However,  the clinical utility  of \nMGPT  is not well established,  especially  in cases  where  more  than  one pathogenic  variant  is identified.  \nThe risk for a specific  malignancy  is complex  and if a gene  panel  discovers  a mutation  incidentally,  \nmanagement  can be difficult.  Many  guidelines  call for radical  procedures  for these  disease  states  and it \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 5 of 10 \nmay  cause  unnecessary  harm  for the patient  concerned  about  predisposition  to the disease.  Additionally,  \na combination  of mutations  may  interact  to alter the profile  of the disease. For instance,  certain  \ncombinations  of mutations  may  be detrimental and increase  the overall  risk of cancer  malignancy,  while  \nother  combinations  may  reduce  overall  risk of malignancy.  In this regard,  identifying  clinically  actionable  \nmutations  may  be unclear  with  MGPT.   \nClinical  Utility  and Validity  \nGenetic  testing  for germline  mutations  “can be conducted  on virtually  any tissue  type, ” although  many  \nlaboratories  prefer blood  samples,  check  swabs  or saliva  samples.  Advancements  in technology  and \navailability  of sequencing,  previously  constrained by limitations  of sequential  single -gene  testing  on \nlimited  patient  samples,  have  led to significant  strides  in the understanding  of the genetic  basis  of \ninherited  and somatic  conditions.   \nVariants  detected  by genetic  testing  include  inherited  germline  variants  and somatic  mutations ; next  \ngeneration  sequencing (NGS)  has allowed  for superior  detection  for these  mutations.  The accuracy  of \nNGS  varies  depending on how  many  genes  are sequenced;  fewer  genes  tend  to result  in higher  accuracy  \nsince  there  will be more  “probe -template  overlap .” Although Sanger  sequencing  remains  the most  \naccurate  at >99.99%  accuracy,  it cannot  sequence  a large  quantity  of genes  in a timely  fashion  and is best  \nused  for sequencing  of a specific  gene.  Pogoda  et al. (2019)  identified  rare variants  in the ATM  gene by \nusing single molecule Molecular Inversion Probes (smMIPSs) , an NGS -based screening method . A total \nof 373 patients with dystonia and six positive controls with previously identified ATM  variants \nparticipated in this study. Results generated by the smMIPs  “produced similar results as routinely used \nNGS -based approaches ” (Pogoda et al., 2019) . This suggests that ATM  screening should be routinely \nused when genetic testing dystonia patients.  Further, smMIPs may be an important technique for the \ngermline screening for all rare neurodegenerative disorders.  \nThe c linical  validity  of a genetic  test depends  primarily  on the expressivity  and penetrance  of a given  \nphenotype.  Penetrance  refers  to the likelihood  of developing  a disease  when the pathogenic  mutation  is \npresent,  and expressivity  refers  to the variations  in the way the disease  is expressed.  For example,  \nvirtually  any mutation  in the APC gene  will cause  symptoms  of familial  adenomatous  polyposis,  thereby  \nincreasing  the clinical  validity  of an APC assessment  while  other  conditions  may  not clinically  manifest  at \nall despite  a mutated  genotype.   \nThe clinical  utility  of a genetic  test generally  relies  on available  treatments  for a condition.  Conditions  \nsuch  as Huntington Disease  that do not have  many  options  for treatment  will have  limited  clinical utility  \ncompared to another  condition  even  though the actual test is highly  valid.  Factors , such  as severity of the \ndisease  and management  options , affect  the clinical  utility  of a genetic  test.   \nLincoln  et al. (2020)  performed  a retrospective study  to investigate the yield  and utility  of germline  \ntesting  on cancer  patients  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing.  The authors  calculated  the prevalence  of \npathogenic  germline  variants  (PVG)  and the potential  actionability  of the PVGs  in 2023  cancer  patients . \n30.5%  (n=617)  of participants  had PVGs . Participants  with  PVGs  spanned  all ages  and cancer  types.  \nTumor  DNA  sequencing missed 8.1%  of PGVs . 11.2%  of missed  PVGs  were  only  detected  after \ndeveloping a second  primary  cancer.  The results  suggest  that missed PVGs  could  have  been  detected  \nearlier and the second  cancer  could  have  been  treated  earlier or prevented.  The authors  concluded  \nthat germline  testing  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing can result  in important  findings  that can impact  \npatient  care.  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 6 of 10 \nVI. Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular \nPathology  (AMP)   \nThe ACMG and AMP released criteria on the types and severity of mutations, which are as follows:  \n• Very strong evidence of pathogenicity : Null variants (nonsense, frameshifts, canonical +/ - 1-2 splice \nsites, initiation codon, exon deletions) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease. The guidelines note to use caution in genes where LOF is not a mechanism, if L OF variants \nare at the 3’ end, if exon skipping occurs, and if multiple transcripts are present.  \n• Strong: Amino acid change to a pathogenic version, de novo mutations, established studies \nsupporting a damaging gene or gene product, or if the prevalence of the variant is increased in affected individuals compared to healthy controls. The guidelines note to be careful of changes \nimpacting splicing and if only the paternity has been confirmed.  \n• Moderate: Located in a mutational hot spot or well- established functional domain (e.g., active site \nof an enzyme) without a benign variation, absent from controls in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium, detected in trans  with pathogenic variants for \na recessive disorder, protein length changes, novel missense changes where a different missense \nchange has been pathogenic before, and a possible de novo mutation.  \n• Supporting: Co -segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively \nknown to cause the disease, missense variant in a gene with low rate of benign missense variation, \nif the mutation has evidence that it is deleterious, or if the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for \ndisease with a single genetic cause.  \nThe guidelines also list criteria for benign gene variants.  \n• Stand- alone evidence of benignity: Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 \nGenomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium  \n• Strong: Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder, observed in healthy adult with full \npenetrance at early age, lack of segregation in affected family members (although pathogenic variants may masquerade as nonsegregated), or well -established studies that show no damaging \neffect on protein production.  \n• Supporting: Missense variant of a gene for which truncating mutations are pathogenic, indels in \nrepetitive region of unknown function, silent variants, variants of unknown significance, or a trans  \nversion of a cis mutation.  \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN)   \nMultiple germline  mutations have been incorporated into the diagnostic workups recommended by the \nNCCN. Furthermore, the NCCN has several guidelines which recommend that gene expression profiling, or multiple gene testing, may be helpful, more efficient and/or cost -effecti ve for selected patients. \nPlease see the individual policies.  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology  (AMP) , American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) , and College \nof American Pathologists ( CAP)  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 7 of 10 \nThe Joint Commission noted that germline variants should focus on the pathogenicity of a given variant \nrather than their impact on clinical care. The guidelines recommend reporting germline variants with known clinical impact , such as BRCA1  or 2. A genetic counseling recommendation should also be \nprovided if a pathogenic germline mutation is found.  \nThe guidelines note that it is critical to identify a somatic vs a germline mutation as the type of mutation \nmay have significant clinical consequences . \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology  (ASCO)   \nThe ASCO published guidelines regarding genetic and genomic testing for cancer susceptibility. These guidelines state that  the “ASCO recognizes that concurrent multigene testing (ie, panel testing) may be \nefficient in circumstances that require evaluation of multiple high -penetrance genes of established \nclinical utility as possible explanations for a patient’s personal or family history of cancer. Depending on the specific genes included on the panel employed, panel testing may also identify mutations in genes associat ed with moderate or low cancer risks and mutations in high -penetrance genes that would not \nhave been evaluated on  the basis of the presenting personal or family history… ASCO affirms that it is \nsufficient for cancer risk assessment to evaluate genes of established clinical utility that are suggested by the patient’s personal and/or family history .” \nASCO released guidelines regarding germline testing for ovarian  cancer. ASCO recommends that “ all \nwomen diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer should be offered germline genetic testing for BRCA1, \nBRCA2 , and other ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, irrespective of their clinical features or family \ncancer history. In addition, “first - or second -degree blood relatives of a patient with ovarian cancer with \na known germline pathogenic cancer susceptibility  gene mutation or variant should be offered \nindividualized genetic risk evaluation, counseling, and genetic testing.” Lastly, “ clinical decisions should \nnot be based on a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).” In this case, the patient’s clinical features and family history should be taken into consideration and should inform clinical decision making.  \nVII. Applicable State and Federal Regulations  \nDISCLAIMER: If there is a conflict between this Policy and any relevant, applicable government policy \nfor a particular member [e.g., Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) or National Coverage \nDeterminations (NCDs) for Medicare and/or state coverage for Medicaid], then the government policy \nwill be used to make the determination.

For the most up -to-date Medicaid policies and coverage, \nvisit the applicable state Medicaid website.  \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)  \nMany labs have developed specific tests that they must validate and perform in house.  These laboratory -\ndeveloped tests (LDTs) are regulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) as high -\ncomplexity tests under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Am endments of 1988 (CLIA ’88).  LDTs are \nnot approved or cleared by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration; however, FDA clearance or approval \nis not currently required for clinical use.   \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 8 of 10 \nVIII. Important Reminder  \nThe purpose of this Medical Policy is to provide a guide to coverage. This Medical Policy is not \nintended to dictate to providers how to practice medicine. Nothing in this Medical Policy is intended to discourage or prohibit providing other medical advice or treatment deemed appropriate by the \ntreating physician.  \nBenefit determinations are subject to applicable member contract language. To the extent there are any conflicts between these guidelines and the contract language, the contract language will control.  \nThis Medical Policy has been developed through consideration of the medical necessity criteria under Hawaii’s Patients’ Bill of Rights and Responsibilities Act (Hawaii Revised Statutes §432E -1.4), or for \nQUEST  Integration  members under Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR 1700.1 -42), generally accepted \nstandards of medical practice and review of medical literature and government approval status. HMSA has determined that services not covered under this Medical Policy will not b e medically necessary \nunder Hawaii law in most cases. If a treating physician disagrees with HMSA’s determination as to medical necessity in a given case, the physician may request that HMSA reconsider the application of the medical necessity criteria to the case at issue in light of any su pporting documentation.  \nGenetic testing is covered for level 1 or 2A recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN  and in accordance with Hawaii’s Patients’ Bill of Rights and Responsibilities Act (Hawaii \nRevised Statutes §432E- 1.4) or for QUEST members , the  Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR 1700.1 -42).    \nIX.

Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for determining hereditary breast and\novarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy . Testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all\nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years, may be indicated for\nguiding cancer therapies. Genetic testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in breast cancer-, pancreatic cancer-, prostate cancer-, or ovarian cancer-\naffected individuals who are considering systemic therapy is addressed separately in evidence reviews 2.04.151, 2.04.148, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156,\nrespectively . Genetic testing for PALB2  variants in pancreatic cancer-af fected individuals is also addressed in 2.04.148. Additionally , conflicting criteria\nreflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited or no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of\ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.\nCurrent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant. In addition, there are potential harms related to stigmatization and discrimination. See policy 2.04.128 regarding testing of BRCA1 , BRCA2,\nand PALB2  for Fanconi anemia. See policies 2.04.148, 2.04.151, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156 regarding genetic testing to guide targeted therapy .\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine T umors\nCurrent NCCN guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( v .2.2024) refers to the NCCN guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk assessment of breast,\novarian, and pancreatic cancers detailed above, and state: \"The panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer\nand in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for inherited susceptibility .\" The panel recommends \"using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary\ncancer syndromes.\"89,\nThe NCCN guidelines for genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers ( v .3.2024) states that germline testing is\nclinically indicated for individuals with neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers per the NCCN guidelines on neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors.90, The\nNCCN guidelines for neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors ( v .1.2024) states, \"consider genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing: In a patient with\nduodenal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at any age\", noting, \"studies of unselected patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have identified\ngermline variants in 16%-17% of cases. However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result\non the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS  was performed  in \n‘rapid  run’ mode  with  a minimum  depth  of 90 Gb per genome  and average  depth  of coverage  of 40-fold.  \nFor rapid  WES  or WGS,  the individual  should  be critically  ill and in the neonatal  or pediatric  intensive  \ncare  units  (NICU,  PICU)  when  the test is ordered  but may  be discharged  before  results  are delivered.  \nCopy  number  variation  (CNV)  analysis  should  be performed  in parallel  with  rWGS  using  chromosomal  \nmicroarray  analysis  (CMA)  or directly  within  rWGS  if the test is validated  for CNV  analysis.  \nExamples  of specific  malformations  highly  suggestive  of a genetic  etiology,  include  but are not limited  to \nany of the following:  \n• Choanal  atresia  \n• Coloboma  \n• Hirschsprung  disease  \n• Meconium  ileus  \nExamples  of an abnormal  laboratory  test suggesting  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype,  \ninclude  but are not limited  to any of the following:  \n• Abnormal  newborn  screen  \n• Conjugated  hyperbilirubinemia  not due to total  parental  nutrition  (TPN)  cholestasis  \n• Hyperammonemia  \n• Lactic  acidosis  not due to poor  perfusion  \n• Refractory  or severe  hypoglycemia  \nExamples  of clinical  features  suggesting  a genetic  disease  include  but are not limited  to any of the \nfollowing:  \n• Significant  hypotonia.  \n• Persistent  seizures.  \n• Infant  with  high  risk stratification  on evaluation  for a Brief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  (BRUE)  \n(see  below)  with  any of the following  features:  \no Recurrent  events  without  respiratory  infection  \no Recurrent  witnessed  seizure  like events  \no Required  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  \no Significantly  abnormal  chemistry  including  but not limited  to electrolytes,  bicarbonate  \nor lactic  acid,  venous  blood  gas, glucose,  or other  tests  that suggest  an inborn  error  of \nmetabolism  \n• Significantly  abnormal  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  including  but not limited  to possible  \nchannelopathies,  arrhythmias,  cardiomyopathies,  myocarditis,  or structural  heart  disease  \n• Family  history  of: \no Arrhythmia  \no BRUE  in sibling  \no Developmental  delay  \no Inborn  error  of metabolism  or genetic  disease  \no Long  QT syndrome  (LQTS)  \no Sudden  unexplained  death  (including  unexplained  car accident  or drowning)  in first- or \nsecond -degree  family  members  before  age 35, and particularly  as an infant  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   4 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  was previously  known  as Apparent  Life Threatening  Event  (ALTE).  In a \npractice  guideline  from  the American  Academy  of Pediatrics  (AAP),  BRUE  is defined  as an event  \noccurring  in an infant  younger  than  1 year  of age when  the observer  reports  a sudden,  brief  (usually  less \nthan  one minute),  and now  resolved  episode  of one or more  of the following:  \n• Absent,  decreased,  or irregular  breathing  \n• Altered  level  of responsiveness  \n• Cyanosis  or pallor  \n• Marked  change  in tone  (hyper - or hypotonia)  \nA BRUE  is diagnosed  only  when  there  is no explanation  for a qualifying  event  after  conducting  an \nappropriate  history  and physical  examination.  \nNote:  More  information  is available  at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590   \nTrio Testing  \nThe recommended  option  for testing  when  possible  is testing  of the child  and both  parents  (trio  testing).  \nTrio testing  increases  the chance  of finding  a definitive  diagnosis  and reduces  false -positive  findings.  \nTrio testing  is preferred  whenever  possible  but should  not delay  testing  of a critically  ill individual  when  \nrapid  testing  is indicated.  Testing  of one available  parent  should  be done  if both  are not immediately  \navailable  and one or both  parents  can be done  later  if needed.  \nGenetics  Nomenclature  Update  \nThe Human  Genome  Variation  Society  nomenclature  is used  to report  information  on variants  found  in \nDNA  and serves  as an international  standard  in DNA  diagnostics.  It is being  implemented  for genetic  \ntesting  medical  evidence  review  updates  starting  in 2017  (see Table  PG1).  The Society's  nomenclature  is \nrecommended  by the Human  Variome  Project,  the Human  Genome  Organisation,  and by the Human  \nGenome  Variation  Society  itself.  \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  and the Association  for Molecular  Pathology  \nstandards  and guidelines  for interpretation  of sequence  variants  represent  expert  opinion  from  both  \norganizations,  in addition  to the College  of American  Pathologists.  These  recommendations  primarily  \napply  to genetic  tests  used  in clinical  laboratories,  including  genotyping,  single  genes,  panels,  exomes,  \nand genomes.  Table  PG2 shows  the recommended  standard  terminology -\"pathogenic,\"  \"likely  \npathogenic,\"  \"uncertain  significance,\"  \"likely  benign,\"  and \"benign\" -to describe  variants  identified  that \ncause  Mendelian  disorders.  \nTable  PG1.

The interpretation  of the results  of genetic  tests  and the understanding  of risk factors  can \nbe very  difficult  and complex.  Therefore,  genetic  counseling  will assist  individuals  in understanding  the \npossible  benefits  and harms  of genetic  testing,  including  the possible  impact  of the information  on the \nindividual's  family.  Genetic  counseling  may  alter  the utilization  of genetic  testing  substantially  and may  \nreduce  inappropriate  testing.  Genetic  counseling  should  be performed  by an individual  with  experience  \nand expertise  in genetic  medicine  and genetic  testing  methods.  \nCoding  \nSee the Codes  table  for details.  \nBENEFIT  APPLICATION  \nBlue  Card/National  Account  Issues  \nSome  Plans  may  have  contract  or benefit  exclusions  for genetic  testing.  \nBenefit  Exceptions  \nThis policy  may  not apply  to all lines  of business  such  as the Federal  Employee  Program,  Medicare  \nSupplement,  Medicare  Advantage,  Medicaid,  and certain  self-insured  groups.  \nBACKGROUND  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  (WES)  is targeted  next -generation  sequencing  (NGS)  of the subset  of the \nhuman  genome  that contains  functionally  important  sequences  of protein -coding  DNA,  while  whole  \ngenome  sequencing  (WGS)  uses  NGS  techniques  to sequence  both  coding  and noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  Whole  exome  sequencing  and WGS  have  been  proposed  for use in patients  presenting  with  \ndisorders  and anomalies  not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  Potential  candidates  for WES  and \nWGS  include  patients  who  present  with  a broad  spectrum  of suspected  genetic  conditions.  \nGiven  the variety  of disorders  and management  approaches,  there  are a variety  of potential  health  \noutcomes  from  a definitive  diagnosis.  In general,  the outcomes  of a molecular  genetic  diagnosis  include  \n(1) impacting  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) informing  follow -up that can benefit  a child  by reducing  \nmorbidity,  and (3) affecting  reproductive  planning  for parents  and potentially  the affected  patient.  \nThe standard  diagnostic  workup  for patients  with  suspected  Mendelian  disorders  may  include  \ncombinations  of radiographic,  electrophysiologic,  biochemical,  biopsy,  and targeted  genetic  \nevaluations.1, The search  for a diagnosis  may  thus  become  a time -consuming  and expensive  process.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  Technology  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  using  NGS  technology  can facilitate  obtaining  a genetic  diagnosis  in \npatients  efficiently.  Whole  exome  sequencing  is limited  to most  of the protein -coding  sequence  of an \nindividual  (»85%),  is composed  of about  20,000  genes  and 180,000  exons  (protein -coding  segments  of a \ngene),  and constitutes  approximately  1% of the genome.  It is believed  that the exome  contains  about  \n85%  of heritable  disease -causing  variants.  Whole  exome  sequencing  has the advantage  of speed  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   6 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nefficiency  relative  to Sanger  sequencing  of multiple  genes.  Whole  exome  sequencing  shares  some  \nlimitations  with  Sanger  sequencing.  For example,  it will not identify  the following:  intronic  sequences  or \ngene  regulatory  regions;  chromosomal  changes;  large  deletions;  duplications;  or rearrangements  within  \ngenes,  nucleotide  repeats,  or epigenetic  changes.  Whole  genome  sequencing  uses  techniques  similar  to \nWES  but includes  noncoding  regions.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has a greater  ability  to detect  large  \ndeletions  or duplications  in protein -coding  regions  compared  with  WES  but requires  greater  data  \nanalytics.  \nTechnical  aspects  of WES  and WGS  are evolving,  including  the development  of databases  such  as the \nNational  Institutes  of Health’s  ClinVar  database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to catalog  \nvariants,  uneven  sequencing  coverage,  gaps  in exon  capture  before  sequencing,  and difficulties  with  \nnarrowing  the large  initial  number  of variants  to manageable  numbers  without  losing  likely  candidate  \ndisease -associated  variants.  The variability  contributed  by the different  platforms  and procedures  used  \nby different  clinical  laboratories  offering  exome  sequencing  as a clinical  service  is unknown.  \nIn 2013,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics,  Association  for Molecular  Pathology,  \nand College  of American  Pathologists  convened  a workgroup  to standardize  terminology  for describing  \nsequence  variants.  In 2015,  guidelines  developed  by this workgroup  describe  criteria  for classifying  \npathogenic  and benign  sequence  variants  based  on 5 categories  of data:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  \nuncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and benign.2, \nRegulatory  Status  \nClinical  laboratories  may  develop  and validate  tests  in-house  and market  them  as a laboratory  service;  \nlaboratory -developed  tests  must  meet  the general  regulatory  standards  of the Clinical  Laboratory  \nImprovement  Amendments  (CLIA).  Whole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  tests  as a clinical  service  are \navailable  under  the auspices  of the CLIA.  Laboratories  that offer  laboratory -developed  tests  must  be \nlicensed  by the CLIA  for high -complexity  testing.  To date,  the U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  \nhas chosen  not to require  any regulatory  review  of this test.  \nRATIONALE  \nThis evidence  review  was created  in September  2013  with  searches  of the PubMed  database.  The most  \nrecent  literature  update  was performed  through  January 6, 2025 . \nEvidence  reviews  assess  whether  a medical  test is clinically  useful.  A useful  test provides  information  to \nmake  a clinical  management  decision  that improves  the net health  outcome.  That  is, the balance  of \nbenefits  and harms  is better  when  the test is used  to manage  the condition  than  when  another  test or \nno test is used  to manage  the condition.  \nThe first step  in assessing  a medical  test is to formulate  the clinical  context  and purpose  of the test.  The \ntest must  be technically  reliable,  clinically  valid,  and clinically  useful  for that purpose.  Evidence  reviews  \nassess  the evidence  on whether  a test is clinically  valid  and clinically  useful.  Technical  reliability  is \noutside  the scope  of these  reviews,  and credible  information  on technical  reliability  is available  from  \nother  sources.  \nThis review  was informed  in part by a TEC Special  Report  (2013)  on exome  sequencing  for patients  with  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders.3, \nIn 2018,  Smith  et al reported  a scoping  review  of genome  and exome  sequencing  as a diagnostic  tool for \npediatric  patients.  4, The authors  identified  171 publications,  although  131 were  case  reports.  They  \nconcluded  that diagnostic  yield  was the only  consistently  reported  outcome.  The median  diagnostic  \nyield  in publications  including  more  than  single  case  reports  was 33%  but varied  by broad  clinical  \ncategories  and test type.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   7 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe following  sections  review  evidence  by test type  (whole  exome  sequencing  [WES]  and whole  genome  \nsequencing  [WGS]),  broad  type  of disorder,  and care  setting  (intensive  care  vs. not intensive  care).  \nPromotion  of greater  diversity  and inclusion  in clinical  research  of historically  marginalized  groups  (e.g.,  \nPeople  of Color  [African -American,  Asian,  Black,  Latino  and Native  American];  LGBTQIA  (Lesbian,  Gay,  \nBisexual,  Transgender,  Queer,  Intersex,  Asexual);  Women;  and People  with  Disabilities  [Physical  and \nInvisible])  allows  policy  populations  to be more  reflective  of and findings  more  applicable  to our diverse  \nmembers.

The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  \nbe considered  clinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that are suspected  to have  a genetic  basis,  but are not \nexplained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or \na neurodevelopmental  disorder:  standard  clinical  workup  without  WES.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   8 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nA number  of studies  have  reported  on the use of WES  in clinical  practice  (Table  1). Typically,  the \npopulations  included  in these  studies  have  had suspected  rare genetic  disorders,  although  the specific  \npopulations  vary.  \nSeries  have  been  reported  with  as many  as 2000  patients.  The most  common  reason  for referral  to a \ntertiary  care  center  was an unexplained  neurodevelopmental  disorder.  Many  patients  had been  through  \na standard  clinical  workup  and testing  without  identification  of a genetic  variant  to explain  their  \ncondition.  Diagnostic  yield  in these  studies,  defined  as the proportion  of tested  patients  with  clinically  \nrelevant  genomic  anomalies,  ranged  from  25%  to 48%.  Because  there  is no reference  standard  for the \ndiagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  strategies,  clinical  confirmation  may  be the \nonly  method  for determining  false -positive  and false -negative  rates.  No reports  were  identified  of \nincorrect  diagnoses,  and how  often  they  might  occur  is unclear.  \nWhen  used  as a first-line test in infants  with  multiple  congenital  anomalies  and dysmorphic  features,  \ndiagnostic  yield  may  be as high  as 58%.  Testing  parent -child  trios  has been  reported  to increase  \ndiagnostic  yield,  to identify  an inherited  variant  from  an unaffected  parent  and be considered  benign,  or \nto identify  a de novo  variant  not present  in an unaffected  parent.  First -line trio testing  for children  with  \ncomplex  neurologic  disorders  was shown  to increase  the diagnostic  yield  (29%,  plus a possible  diagnostic  \nfinding  in 27%)  compared  with  a standard  clinical  pathway  (7%)  performed  in parallel  in the same  \npatients.5, \nTable  1.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs).  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WES  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nCohort  studies  following  children  from  presentation  to outcomes  have  not been  reported.  There  are \nconsiderable  challenges  conducting  studies  of sufficient  size given  underlying  genetic  heterogeneity,  and \nincluding  follow -up adequate  to observe  final  health  outcomes.  Studies  addressing  clinical  utility  have  \nreported  mainly  diagnostic  yield  and management  changes.  Thus,  it is difficult  to quantify  lower  or \nupper  bounds  for any potential  improvement  in the net health  outcome  owing  in part to the \nheterogeneity  of disorders,  rarity,  and outcome  importance  that may  differ  according  to identified  \npathogenic  variants.  Actionable  items  following  testing  in the reviewed  studies  (Table  1) included  family  \nplanning,  change  in management,  change  or avoidance  of additional  testing,  surveillance  for associated  \nmorbidities,  prognosis,  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nThe evidence  reviewed  here  reflects  the accompanying  uncertainty,  but supports  a perspective  that \nidentifying  a pathogenic  variant  can (1) impact  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) inform  follow -up that can \nbenefit  a child  by reducing  morbidity  and rarely  potential  mortality,  and (3) affect  reproductive  planning  \nfor parents  and later,  potentially  the affected  child.  When  recurrence  risk can be estimated  for an \nidentified  variant  (e.g., by including  parent  testing),  future  reproductive  decisions  can be affected.

Comparative  studies  have  reported  an increase  in \ndiagnostic  yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Thus,  for individuals  who  have  a suspected  \ngenetic  etiology  but for whom  the specific  genetic  alteration  is unclear  or unidentified  by a standard  \nclinical  workup,  WES  may  return  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  A genetic  diagnosis  for these  patients  is \nreported  to change  management,  including  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  \nending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  for Children  with  a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  other  than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  \nWorkup;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nMost  of the literature  on WES  is on neurodevelopmental  disorders  in children;  however,  other  potential  \nindications  for WES  have  been  reported  (Table  2). These  include  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy,  \ninherited  retinal  disease,  and other  disorders  including  mitochondrial,  endocrine,  and immunologic  \ndisorders.  \nThe purpose  of WES  in patients  who  have  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or \nheritable  disorder  may  be considered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  a disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that is suspected  to have  a genetic  \nbasis  but is not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  \nmultiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder:  a standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  \nvaries  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  \ndysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and \nimaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  \nfor that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   13 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies,  therefore  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nStudies  have  assessed  WES  for a broad  spectrum  of disorders.  The diagnostic  yield  in patient  \npopulations  restricted  to specific  phenotypes  ranges  from  3% for colorectal  cancer  to 60%  for \nunexplained  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  (Table  2). Some  studies  used  a virtual  gene  panel  that is \nrestricted  to genes  associated  with  the phenotype,  while  others  have  examined  the whole  exome,  either  \ninitially  or sequentially.  An advantage  of WES  over  individual  gene  or gene  panel  testing  is that the \nstored  data  allows  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  Whole  exome  \nsequencing  has also been  reported  to be beneficial  in patients  with  atypical  presentations.  \nTable  2.

Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WES  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nA genetic  diagnosis  for an unexplained  disorder  can alter  management  in several  ways:  such  a diagnosis  \nmay  lead  to genetic  counseling  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and may  affect  reproductive  decision  \nmaking.  \nBecause  the clinical  validity  of WES  for this indication  has not been  established,  a chain  of evidence  \ncannot  be constructed.  \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder  \nThere  is an increasing  number  of reports  assessing  use of WES  to identify  a molecular  basis  for disorders  \nother  than  multiple  congenital  anomalies  or neurodevelopmental  disorders.  The diagnostic  yields  in \nthese  studies  ranged  from  3% for colorectal  cancer  to 60%  for trio (parents  and child)  analysis  of limb -\ngirdle  muscular  dystrophy.  Some  studies  have  reported  on the use of a virtual  gene  panel  with  restricted  \nanalysis  of disease -associated  genes,  and the authors  noted  that WES  data  allow  reanalysis  as new  \ngenes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for \nany specific  disorder,  and study  of WES  in these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  \nchanges  in patient  management.  \nRepeat  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test,  in individuals  who  have  \npreviously  received  WES  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  \nThe criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be considered  \nclinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   18 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test.  \nRepeat  WES  is intended  to be used  after  a WES  test has been  performed  without  establishing  a \ndiagnosis.  Repeat  testing  could  lead  to a diagnosis  in a previously  undiagnosed  individual  as new  \npathogenic  genes  or variants  are identified  or new  diagnostic  technologies  are developed.  Additionally,  \ntesting  strategies  might  be revised  based  on the emergence  of new  clinical  features  as a child  develops  \nor the identification  of congenital  anomalies  or developmental  disorders  in additional  family  members.  \nComparators  \nThe comparators  of interest  for this indication  are no further  molecular  testing  following  an initial  WES  \ntest,  and WGS  following  an initial  WES  test.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of individuals  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  individual.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of repeat  WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  of repeat  WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nSystematic  Review  \nDai et al (2022)  conducted  a systematic  review  to determine  the diagnostic  yield  of sequencing  \nreanalysis  of data  from  cases  with  no diagnosis  following  an initial  WES  or WGS  test (Table  5).33,The \nprimary  measure  of efficacy  was the proportion  of undiagnosed  individuals  reaching  a positive  diagnosis  \non reanalysis  after  first round  sequencing  and analysis.  Results  are summarized  in Table  6. The overall  \ndiagnostic  yield  was 0.10  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI], 0.06  to 0.13).  Using  the GRADE  framework,  the \ncertainty  of the evidence  for this outcome  was rated  moderate  certainty.  Confidence  in the estimate  \nwas downgraded  due to significant  heterogeneity  across  studies  that could  not be explained  by \nsubgroup  analyses.  The researchers  performed  subgroup  analyses  on the basis  of time  interval  between  \nthe original  analysis  and reanalysis  (<24  months  compared  with  ≥24 months),  sequencing  methodology  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   19 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n(WES  vs. WGS),  study  sample  size (<50,  50 to 100,  >100  patients),  sequencing  of family  members  for \nsegregation  analysis,  whether  research  validation  of novel  variants/genes  were  conducted,  and whether  \nany artificial  intelligence -based  tools  were  used  in variant  curation.  These  subgroup  analyses  did not \nidentify  any statistically  significant  differences  in diagnostic  yield  estimates.  \nTable  5.

In 62%  of these  cases  the reason  was a new  gene  discovery,  in 15%  the reasons  were  \nunknown  or unspecified,  and in 11%  the reason  was validation  of candidate  variants  through  research  or \nexternal  collaboration.  Other  reasons  included  bioinformatic  pipeline  improvements  (3.3%),  laboratory  \nerrors/misinterpretations  (2.8%),  updated  clinical  phenotypes  (2.1%),  copy  number  variants  (1.9%),  and \nadditional  segregation  studies  in relatives  (1.2%).  \nOnly  7 of 29 studies  provided  individual  clinical  information  of sequenced  probands  (e.g.,  diagnosed  \nvariant,  or timing  of reanalysis)  but instead  reported  summary  data  of the overall  population.  There  \nwere  11 studies  that reported  the finding  of variants  of uncertain  significance  (VUS)  and/or  variants  in \nnovel  genes  but only  8 studies  provided  research  evidence  confirming  their  pathogenicity.  Only  3 studies  \ndiscussed  whether  a genetic  diagnosis  led to management  changes,  and the impact  on management  was \nonly  described  in a subgroup  of individuals.  To address  uncertainties  in the evidence,  the review  authors  \nrecommended  best  practices  for future  research  including  detailed  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria,  \ndetailed  clinical  information  on each  case,  clear  documentation  of methodology  used  for initial  and re-\nanalysis,  and reporting  of the rationale  for attribution  of pathogenicity.  \nNonrandomized  Studies  \nTable  7 summarizes  nonrandomized  studies  published  after  the Dai et al (2022)  systematic  review.

The net health  outcome  can be \nimproved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  more  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or \ntesting.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of repeat  WES  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  following  an initial  WES  test were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nDue to heterogeneity  and limitations  in individuals  studies,  the evidence  is insufficient  to establish  a \nchain  of evidence  for the clinical  utility  of repeat  WES  testing  in individuals  who  are undiagnosed  \nfollowing  an initial  WES  test.  \nSection  Summary:  Repeat  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  \nIn a systematic  review  of nonrandomized  studies,  re-analysis  of WES  data  resulted  in an 11%  increase  in \ndiagnostic  yield  (95%  CI 8% to 14%)  in individuals  who  were  previously  undiagnosed  via WES.  However,  \nthe evidence  is insufficient  to establish  the clinical  utility  of repeat  testing.  Individual  studies  lacked  \ndetail  on the reasons  for new  diagnoses,  changes  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the \nfrequency  of the identification  of VUS.  Additionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  \nestablished,  and there  are no clear  guidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  \ntesting.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup  or Whole  Exome  \nSequencing;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  is to establish  a \nmolecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the genome.  The criteria  under  \nwhich  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be considered  clinically  useful  are stated  \nabove.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   23 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup.  \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible.  Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  as a \nclinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practices  are currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  A standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS,  and WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  Compared  to Standard  Clinical  Workup  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   24 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  workup  \nin several  observational  studies,  both  prospective  and retrospective.  Studies  are described  in Table  10. \nThe diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has been  between  20%  and 40%.  Additional  indirect  evidence  is available  \nfrom  studies  reporting  diagnostic  yield  of WES  in a similar  population  as summarized  above,  and it is \nreasonable  to expect  that WGS  is likely  to result  in similar  or better  diagnostic  yield  for pathogenic  or \nlikely  pathogenic  variants  as compared  with  WES.  \nTable  10.

Ten studies (ES=9; GS=1), \ncomprising 1905 probands, compared diagnostic rate among pediatric vs adult patients within cohorts, \nfinding pediatric patients had 1.6 -times odds of a diagnosis compared to that of adult patients (95% CI \n1.22 -2.10, I 2 = 0%, P <.01).  \nAcross all age groups, diagnostic rates of whole exome sequencing (0.38; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.40) and \nwhole genome sequencing (0.34; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.38) were similar (p=.1). Within -cohort comparison \nfrom 9 studies (2269 probands) showed 1.2 -times odds of diagnosis by whole genome sequencing over \nwhole exome sequencing (95% CI: 0.79 to 1.83; p=.38).Whole genome sequencing studies identified a \nhigher range of novel genes (GS: 2 -579 novel genes based on 6 studies, 5538 probands vs. ES: 1 -75 novel \ngenes based on 22 studies, 5038 probands). Variants of unknown significance (VUS) had wide ranges for \nboth ES and GS (ES: <1 -59%; GS: 6 -50%; p=.78), with severe heterogeneity in methodology and \nreporting. Overall, VUS showed a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2021.  \nThe quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool was used to assess bias in the included \nstudies. Studies with a low bias ranking in all domains were deemed high -quality and were used in a \nseparate analysis. Among the 22 high -quality studies (4,580 probands), the clinical utility of whole \ngenome sequencing (0.77; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.90) was higher than that of whole exome sequencing (0.44; \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   28 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n95% CI: 0.30 to 0.58) (p<.01). It is unclear if any study compared whole exome sequencing with \nassessment of structural variants versus whole genome sequencing.  \nA 2020  Health  Technology  Assessment  conducted  by Ontario  Health,  with  literature  searches  conducted  \nin January  2019,  included  a comparative  review  of the diagnostic  yield  of WES  and WGS  in children  with  \nunexplained  developmental  disabilities  or multiple  congenital  anomalies.45, The diagnostic  yield  across  \nall studies  was 37%  (95%  CI, 34%  to 40%).  More  studies,  with  an overall  larger  sample  size,  were  \nincluded  in the examination  on WES  (34 studies,  N=9142)  than  on WGS  (9 studies,  N=648).  Confidence  \nintervals  for studies  using  WES  versus  WGS  overlapped  (37%;  95%  CI, 34%  to 40%,  vs. 40%;  95%  CI, 32%  \nto 49%).  Diagnostic  yield  ranged  between  16%  and 73%,  with  variation  attributed  largely  to technology  \nused  and participant  selection.  The overall  quality  of the evidence  was rated  as very  low,  downgraded  \nfor risk of bias,  inconsistency,  indirectness,  and imprecision.  \nIn some  studies  of WGS,  the genes  examined  were  those  previously  associated  with  the phenotype,  \nwhile  other  studies  were  research -based  and conducted  more  exploratory  analysis.  It has been  noted  \nthat genomes  sequenced  with  WGS  are available  for future  review  when  new  variants  associated  with  \nclinical  diseases  are discovered.37, \nStudies  have  shown  that WGS  can detect  more  pathogenic  variants  than  WES,  due to an improvement  in \ndetecting  copy  number  variants,  insertions  and deletions,  intronic  single -nucleotide  variants,  and exonic  \nsingle -nucleotide  variants  in regions  with  poor  coverage  on WES.  A majority  of studies  have  described  \nmethods  for interpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  \nincluded  in the diagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  not reported.  Five studies  included  in the Ontario  \nHealth  Technology  Assessment  review  provided  data  on the yield  of VUS,  with  an overall  yield  of 17%.  \nOnly  1 of the 5 studies  used  WGS,  however.  The review  authors  noted,  \"Whole  genome  sequencing  \nalways  results  in substantially  longer  lists of variants  of unknown  significance  than  whole  exome  \nsequencing  does.  Interpreting  and acting  upon  variants  of unknown  clinical  significance  is the single  \ngreatest  challenge  identified  by clinicians….”45, \nClinically  Useful  \nA test is clinically  useful  if the use of the results  informs  management  decisions  that improve  the net \nhealth  outcome  of care.  The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  or \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WGS  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  outside  of critical  care  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nClinical  validity  is established  based  on the meaningful  diagnostic  yield  associated  with  WGS  when  a \ngenetic  etiology  is uncertain  after  standard  workup.  Studies  on WGS  report  changes  in management  \nthat would  improve  health  outcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as \nthose  with  WES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   29 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup;  Individuals  who  are \nnot Critically  Ill \nWhole  genome  sequencing  has been  studied  in non-critically  ill children  with  congenital  anomalies  and \ndevelopmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup.  The diagnostic  yield  for WGS  \nhas been  reported  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for interpretation  of \nWGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the diagnostic  yield  \nand that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of WGS  is at least  as high  as \nWES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is unclear  if the additional  \nyield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  outcomes.  Further,  while  \nreporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  across  laboratories,  WGS  \nresults  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of this difference  are \nuncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS reclassification  allowing  a \ndiagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the occurrence  of medical  \nmismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well defined,  and provider  \nreluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS identification  by WGS.  As \nsuch,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  utility.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  Congenital  \nAnomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup.  \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible.  Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  The \nmedian  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  \ncondition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   30 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  in several  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective.  Studies  are described  in Table  13. The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has \nbeen  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  studies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  \npopulations  and include  little  information  about  associated  changes  in management  following  genetic  \ndiagnosis.  \nTable  13.

The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has been  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  \nstudies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  populations  and include  little  information  about  \nassociated  changes  in management  following  genetic  diagnosis.  \nRapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of rapid  WES  (rWES)  or rWGS  in critically  ill patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of \nunknown  etiology  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of \nthe genome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe most  common  cause  of death  in neonates  in the United  States  is genetic  disorders.  Currently,  \ncritically  ill neonates  with  suspected  genetic  diseases  are frequently  discharged  or deceased  without  a \ndiagnosis.  There  are thousands  of rare genetic  disorders.  The presentation  of many  of these  disorders  in \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   34 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nneonates  may  be nonspecific  or differ  from  the presentation  in older  patients  and the disorder  may  \nproduce  secondary  involvement  of other  systems  due to the fragility  of the neonate  that obscures  the \nprimary  pathology.  The neonatal  intensive  care  unit (NICU)  treatment  of suspected  genetic  diseases  is \noften  empirical.  Rapid  diagnosis  is critical  for delivery  of interventions  that reduce  morbidity  and \nmortality  in genetic  diseases  for which  treatments  exist.  For many  genetic  diseases  there  is no effective  \ntreatment  and timely  diagnosis  limits  futile  intensive  care.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is critically  ill infants  presenting  with  any of a variety  of disorders  and \nanomalies  suspected  to have  a genetic  basis  but not explained  by a standard  workup.  For example,  \npatients  may  have  a phenotype  that does  not correspond  with  a specific  disorder  for which  a genetic  \ntest targeting  a specific  gene  is available.  Specifically  for critically  ill infants,  the population  would  also \ninclude  patients  for whom  specific  diagnostic  tests  available  for that phenotype  are not accessible  within  \na reasonable  timeframe.  Petrikin  (2018)  identified  critically  ill infants  that are appropriate  for rapid  \ntesting  as meeting  the following  inclusion  criteria:  multiple  congenital  anomalies;  an abnormal  \nlaboratory  test suggests  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype;  an abnormal  response  to \nstandard  therapy  for a major  underlying  condition;  significant  hypotonia;  or persistent  seizures.  \nExclusion  criteria  included:  an infection  with  normal  response  to therapy;  isolated  prematurity;  isolated  \nunconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia;  Hypoxic  Ischemic  Encephalopathy;  confirmed  genetic  diagnosis  \nexplains  illness;  Isolated  Transient  Neonatal  Tachypnea;  or nonviable  neonates.53, \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  \n• rapid  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible  \n• rapid  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible  \nSeveral  laboratories  offer  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rWES  or \nrWGS  or standard  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nIn its 2021  guideline,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  defines  rapid  and \nultrarapid  testing  as 6 to 15 days  and 1 to 3 days,  respectively.54, \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WES  or WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  \ndiagnosis  or screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  a standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  \ngenetic  condition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nOutcomes  of interest  are as described  above  for use of WES  in patients  with  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder.  For critically  ill infants,  rapid  diagnosis  is important;  \ntherefore,  in addition  to the outcomes  described  in the previous  section,  time  to diagnosis  and time  to \ndischarge  are also outcomes  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   35 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOf course,  mortality  is a compelling  outcome.  However,  many  of the conditions  are untreatable  and \ndiagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care  but may  not \nprolong  survival.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of rWES  or rWGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rWES  or rWGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of rWES  and rWGS  has been  studied  in critically  ill children  in multiple  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective,  and in 3 RCTs.  Studies  are described  in Table  16. The RCTs  are \ndiscussed  in more  detail  in the following  ‘clinically  useful’  section.  One study  included  only  infants  with  \ncardiac  defects  and had a diagnostic  yield  of 6% with  WGS.  The remaining  studies  included  \nphenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill infants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%.  \nTable  16.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials.  \nRandomized  Controlled  Trials  \nThree  RCTs  have  evaluated  rWGS  or rWES  in critically  ill infants  or children.  \nKingsmore  et al (2019)  reported  early  results  of A Randomized,  Blinded,  Prospective  Study  of the Clinical  \nUtility  of Rapid  Genomic  Sequencing  for Infants  in the Acute -care  Setting  (NSIGHT2)  trial66,. NSIGHT2  was \na randomized,  controlled,  blinded  trial of the effectiveness  of rapid  whole -genome  or -exome  \nsequencing  (rWGS  or rWES,  respectively)  in seriously  ill infants  with  diseases  of unknown  etiology  \nprimarily  from  the NICU,  pediatric  intensive  care  unit (PICU),  and cardiovascular  intensive  care  unit \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   42 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n(CVICU)  at a single  hospital  in San Diego.  Details  of the study  are provided  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. Ninety -five infants  were  randomized  to rWES  and 94 to rWGS.  In addition,  24 infants  \nwho  were  gravely  ill received  ultrarapid  WGS  (urWGS).  The initial  Kingsmore  et al (2019)  publication  \nincluded  only  the diagnostic  outcomes.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. 20%,  \nrespectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  Although  the urWGS  was not part of the \nrandomized  portion  of the study,  the proportion  diagnosed  by urWGS  was 11 of 24 (46%)  and time  to \nresult  was a median  of 4.6 days.  The incremental  diagnostic  yield  of reflexing  to trio testing  after  \ninconclusive  proband  analysis  was 0.7%  (1 of 147).  In 2020,  Dimmock  et al reported  results  of the \nprimary  endpoint  of NSIGHT2:  clinician  perception  that rWGS  was useful  and clinician -reported  changes  \nin management.67, Clinicians  provided  perceptions  of the clinical  utility  of diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  \nfor 201 of 213 infants  randomized  (94%).  In 154 (77%)  infants,  diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  was \nperceived  to be useful  or very  useful;  perceptions  of usefulness  did not differ  between  infants  who  \nreceived  rWES  and rWGS,  nor between  urWGS  and rWES/rWGS.  Thirty -two (15%)  of 207 clinician  \nresponses  indicated  that diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  changed  infant  outcomes  (by targeted  \ntreatments  in 21 [10%]  infants,  avoidance  of complications  in 16 [8%],  and institution  of palliative  care  in \n2 [1%]  infants).  Changes  in outcome  did not differ  significantly  between  infants  randomized  to rWES  and \nrWGS,  although  urWGS  was associated  with  a significantly  higher  rate of change  in management  than  \nrWES/rWGS  (63%  vs. 23%;  p=.0001).  \nPetrikin  et al (2018)  reported  on the Prospective  Randomized  Trial  of the Clinical  Utility  of Rapid  Next  \nGeneration  Sequencing  in Acutely  Ill Neonates  (NSIGHT1;  NCT02225522)  RCT of rWGS  to diagnose  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants.53, In brief,  NSIGHT1  was an investigator -initiated  \n(funded  by the National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute  and Eunice  Kennedy  Shriver  National  \nInstitute  of Child  Health  and Human  Development),  blinded,  and pragmatic  trial comparing  trio rWGS  \nwith  standard  genetic  tests  to standard  genetic  tests  alone  with  a primary  outcome  of the proportion  of \nNICU/PICU  infants  receiving  a genetic  diagnosis  within  28 days.  Parents  of patients  and clinicians  were  \nunblinded  after  10 days  and compassionate  cross -over  to rWGS  occurred  in 5 control  patients.  The study  \nwas designed  to enroll  500 patients  in each  group  but was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on \nthe part of study  clinicians  who  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus \ntrio rWGS.  Intention -to-treat  analyses  were  reported,  i.e., crossovers  were  included  in the group  to \nwhich  they  were  randomized.  The trial required  confirmatory  testing  of WGS  results,  which  lengthened  \nthe time  to rWGS  diagnosis  by 7 to 10 days.  Study  characteristics  are shown  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. \nIn the NICUSeq  RCT,  Krantz  et al (2021)  compared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  \nreporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  \nunit (ICU)  with  a suspected  genetic  disease  at 5 sites  in the US.68, In 76%  of cases,  both  parents  were  \navailable  for trio testing.  Overall,  82 of 354 infants  received  a diagnosis  (23%),  with  a higher  yield  in the \n15-day group  (Table  19). The primary  outcome  was change  in management,  measured  at day 60. \nSignificantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  the delayed  \narm (21.1%  vs 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Changes  in management  included  \nsubspecialty  referral  (21 of 354,  6.0%),  changes  to medication  (5 of 354,  1.4%),  therapeutics  specific  to \nthe primary  genetic  etiology  (7 of 354;  2.0%)  and surgical  interventions  (12 of 354;  3.4%).

Studies  on rWGS  report  changes  in management  that would  improve  health  \noutcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as those  with  WES,  including  \navoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  discontinuation  of or \nadditional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  A chain  of evidence  linking  \nmeaningful  improvements  in diagnostic  yield  and changes  in management  expected  to improve  health  \noutcomes  supports  the clinical  value  of WES  and WGS  for critically  ill infants.  \nSection  Summary:  Rapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nFor critically  ill infants,  disease  may  progress  rapidly  and genetic  diagnoses  must  be made  quickly.  \nSeveral  retrospective  and prospective  observational  studies  with  sample  sizes  ranging  from  about  20 to \nmore  than  275 (in total  including  more  than  450 critically  ill infants  or children)  reported  on diagnostic  \nyield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse,  but critically  ill, infants  and had \nyields  between  30%  and 60%  and reports  of changes  in management  such  as avoidance  of invasive  \nprocedures,  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  \ncare.  \nThree  RCTs  have  evaluated  rWGS  in critically  ill infants  or children.  An RCT comparing  trio rWGS  with  \nstandard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants  funded  by the \nNational  Institutes  of Health  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on the part of study  clinicians  \nwho  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus trio rWGS.  The rate of \ngenetic  diagnosis  within  28 days  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; \np=.003)  and the time  to diagnosis  was shorter  (13 days  vs. 107 days;  p=.002).  The age at hospital  \ndischarge  and mortality  rates  were  similar  in the 2 groups.  However,  many  of the conditions  are \nuntreatable  and diagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care,  \nbut may  not prolong  survival.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill infants  with  diseases  \nof unknown  etiology  from  the NICU,  PICU,  and CVICU.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was \nsimilar  (19%  vs. 20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT \ncompared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  \nreturned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an ICU with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  \nSummary  of Evidence  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  receive  whole  \nexome  sequencing  (WES)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  large  case  series  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   47 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nwithin -subject  comparisons.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in \nreproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  Patients  who  have  multiple  congenital  anomalies  \nor a developmental  disorder  with  a suspected  genetic  etiology,  but whose  specific  genetic  alteration  is \nunclear  or unidentified  by a standard  clinical  workup,  may  be left without  a clinical  diagnosis  of their  \ndisorder,  despite  a lengthy  diagnostic  workup.  For a substantial  proportion  of these  patients,  WES  may  \nreturn  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  Several  large  and smaller  series  have  reported  diagnostic  yields  of \nWES  ranging  from  25%  to 60%,  depending  on the individual’s  age,  phenotype,  and previous  workup.  \nOne comparative  study  found  a 44%  increase  in yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Many  \nof the studies  have  also reported  changes  in patient  management,  including  medication  changes,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  The \nevidence  is sufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  \nreceive  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  small  case  series  and prospective  \nresearch  studies.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  \ndecision  making,  and resource  utilization.  There  is an increasing  number  of reports  evaluating  the use of \nWES  to identify  a molecular  basis  for disorders  other  than  multiple  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders.  The diagnostic  yields  in these  studies  range  from  as low as 3% to 60%.  \nSome  studies  have  reported  on the use of a virtual  gene  panel  with  restricted  analysis  of disease -\nassociated  genes,  and WES  data  allow  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  \nOverall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  disorder,  and clinical  use of WES  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  changes  in patient  management.  The \nevidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES  who  receive  repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of \nprevious  test results,  the evidence  includes  nonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  There  is no direct  evidence  of clinical  utility.  In a meta -analysis  of nonrandomized  studies,  re-\nanalysis  of WES  data  resulted  in an 11%  increase  in diagnostic  yield  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI), 8% to \n14%)  in individuals  who  were  previously  undiagnosed  via WES.  Three  nonrandomized  studies  published  \nafter  the meta -analysis  had findings  consistent  with  the meta -analysis.  Conclusions  were  limited  by \nheterogeneity  across  individual  studies  and a lack of detailed  reporting  on reasons  for new  diagnoses,  \nchanges  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the frequency  of the identification  of variants  of \nuncertain  significance  (VUS).  Therefore,  a chain  of evidence  for clinical  utility  cannot  be established.  \nAdditionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  established,  and there  are no clear  \nguidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  testing.  The evidence  is insufficient  to \ndetermine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  or WES  who  \nreceive  whole  genome  sequencing  (WGS)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  \nnonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  \noutcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  In studies  of children  with  \ncongenital  anomalies  and developmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  clinical  workup,  \nthe yield  of WGS  has ranged  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for \ninterpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the \ndiagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  In a systematic  review,  the pooled  (9 \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   48 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nstudies,  N=648)  diagnostic  yield  of WGS  was 40%  (95%  CI, 32%  to 49%).  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of \nWGS  is at least  as high  as WES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is \nunclear  if the additional  yield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  \noutcomes.  Further,  while  reporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  \nacross  laboratories,  WGS  results  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of \nthis difference  are uncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS \nreclassification  allowing  a diagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the \noccurrence  of medical  mismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well \ndefined,  and provider  reluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS \nidentification  by WGS.  As such,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  \nutility.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the \nnet health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  who  receive  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  case  series.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has also been  studied  in other  genetic  conditions  with  yield  \nranging  from  9% to 55%.  Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  \ndisorder,  and clinical  use of WGS  as well as information  regarding  meaningful  changes  in management  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  \nresults  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are critically  ill infants  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  \nfollowing  a standard  workup  who  receive  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  or rapid  WES  (rWES)  with  trio testing  when  \npossible,  the evidence  includes  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and case  series.  Relevant  outcomes  \nare test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  \nOne RCT comparing  rWGS  with  standard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in \ncritically  ill infants  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise.  The rate of genetic  diagnosis  within  28 \ndays  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; p=.003).  Changes  in \nmanagement  due to test results  were  reported  in 41%  (p=.11)  of rWGS  versus  21%  of control  patients;  \nhowever,  73%  of control  subjects  received  broad  genetic  tests  (e.g., next -generation  sequencing  panel  \ntesting,  WES,  or WGS)  as part of standard  testing.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill \ninfants  with  diseases  of unknown  etiology  from  the neonatal  intensive  care  unit,  pediatric  intensive  care  \nunit,  and cardiovascular  intensive  care  unit.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. \n20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT compared  rWGS  \n(test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 \ndays)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  unit with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Several  retrospective  \nand prospective  studies  including  more  than  800 critically  ill infants  and children  in total  have  reported  \non diagnostic  yield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill \ninfants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%  for pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants.  Studies  \nhave  also reported  associated  changes  in patient  management  for patients  receiving  a diagnosis  from  \nrWGS  or rWES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.

The evidence  is sufficient  to \ndetermine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nSUPPLEMENTAL  INFORMATION  \nThe purpose  of the following  information  is to provide  reference  material.  Inclusion  does  not imply  \nendorsement  or alignment  with  the evidence  review  conclusions.  \nPractice  Guidelines  and Position  Statements  \nGuidelines  or position  statements  will be considered  for inclusion  in ‘Supplemental  Information’  if they  \nwere  issued  by, or jointly  by, a US professional  society,  an international  society  with  US representation,  \nor National  Institute  for Health  and Care  Excellence  (NICE).  Priority  will be given  to guidelines  that are \ninformed  by a systematic  review,  include  strength  of evidence  ratings,  and include  a description  of \nmanagement  of conflict  of interest.  \nAmerican  Academy  of Neurology  et al \nIn 2014,  the American  Academy  of Neurology  and American  Association  of Neuromuscular  and \nElectrodiagnostic  Medicine  issued  evidence -based  guidelines  on the diagnosis  and treatment  of limb -\ngirdle  and distal  dystrophies,  which  made  the following  recommendations  (Table  23).69, \nTable  23. Guidelines  on Limb -Girdle  Muscular  Dystrophy  \nRecommendation  LOE \nDiagnosis   \n• For patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy,  clinicians  should  use a clinical  approach  to guide  \ngenetic  diagnosis  based  on the clinical  phenotype,  including  the pattern  of muscle  involvement,  \ninheritance  pattern,  age at onset,  and associated  manifestations  (e.g., early  contractures,  cardiac  \nor respiratory  involvement).  B \n• In patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy  in whom  initial  clinically  directed  genetic  testing  \ndoes  not provide  a diagnosis,  clinicians  may  obtain  genetic  consultation  or perform  parallel  \nsequencing  of targeted  exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -genome  screening,  or next -\ngeneration  sequencing  to identify  the genetic  abnormality.  C \nManagement  of cardiac  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  refer  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  (1) limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  \n(LGMD)1A,  LGMD1B,  LGMD1D,  LGMD1E,  LGMD2C –K, LGMD2M –P, … or (2) muscular  dystrophy  \nwithout  a specific  genetic  diagnosis  for cardiology  evaluation,  including  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  \nand structural  evaluation  (echocardiography  or cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  [MRI]),  even  \nif they  are asymptomatic  from  a cardiac  standpoint,  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• If ECG or structural  cardiac  evaluation  (e.g., echocardiography)  has abnormal  results,  or if the \npatient  has episodes  of syncope,  near -syncope,  or palpitations,  clinicians  should  order  rhythm  \nevaluation  (e.g., Holter  monitor  or event  monitor)  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  palpitations,  symptomatic  or \nasymptomatic  tachycardia  or arrhythmias,  or signs  and symptoms  of cardiac  failure  for cardiology  \nevaluation.  B \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2A,  LGMD2B,  and LGMD2L  for cardiac  \nevaluation  unless  they  develop  overt  cardiac  signs  or symptoms.  B \nManagement  of pulmonary  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  order  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  \ninspiratory/expiratory  force  in the upright  and,  if normal,  supine  positions)  or refer  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  (to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency)  in muscular  dystrophy  patients  at the \ntime  of diagnosis,  or if they  develop  pulmonary  symptoms  later  in their  course.  B \n• In patients  with  a known  high  risk of respiratory  failure  (e.g., those  with  LGMD2I  …), clinicians  \nshould  obtain  periodic  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  inspiratory/expiratory  B \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   50 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nforce  in the upright  position  and,  if normal,  in the supine  position)  or evaluation  by a \npulmonologist  to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency.  \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2B  and LGMD2L  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  unless  they  are symptomatic.  C \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  excessive  daytime  somnolence,  \nnonrestorative  sleep  (e.g., frequent  nocturnal  arousals,  morning  headaches,  excessive  daytime  \nfatigue),  or respiratory  insufficiency  based  on pulmonary  function  tests  for pulmonary  or sleep  \nmedicine  consultation  for consideration  of noninvasive  ventilation  to improve  quality  of life.

States  can define  EHBs  for their  respective  state.  \nStates  vary  on how  they  define  the term  small  group.  In Idaho,  a small  group  employer  is defined  as an \nemployer  with  at least  two but no more  than  fifty eligible  employees  on the first day of the plan  or \ncontract  year,  the majority  of whom  are employed  in Idaho.   Large  group  employers,  whether  they  are \nself-funded  or fully  insured,  are not required  to offer  EHBs,  but may  voluntar ily offer  them.   \nThe ACA requires  any benefit  plan  offering  EHBs  to remove  all dollar  limits  for EHBs.  \nREFERENCES  \n1.

Testing of one available parent should be done if both are not \nimmediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  Duo testing is an \nalternate option (child and one parent*) if only one parent is available.   \n \n*a biological sibling may be considered as a substitute if a parent is unavailable.   \n \nRapid Sequencing \nIn the NSIGHT1 trial (Petrikin, 2018) rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (rWGS) provided time to \nprovisional diagnosis by 10 days with time to final report of approximately 17 days although the \ntrial required confirmatory testing of WGS results which lengthened the time to rWGS diagnosis \nby 7–10 days. The WGS was performed in ‘rapid run’ mode with minimum depth of 90 Gb per \ngenome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold. \nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and, in the NICU or PICU, when the \ntest is ordered but may be discharged before results are delivered. \nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using \nchromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within rWGS if the test is validated for CNV \nanalysis. \nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, include but are not \nlimited to any of the following: \n Choanal atresia \n Coloboma \n Hirschsprung disease \n Meconium ileus \n \nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic \nphenotype include, but are not limited to, any of the following: \n Abnormal newborn screen \n Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis \n Hyperammonemia \n Lactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion \n Refractory or severe hypoglycemia \n \nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include, but not limited to, any of the \nfollowing: \n Significant hypotonia \n Persistent seizures \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 4  \n Infant with high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief resolved unexplained event \n(BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features: \no Recurrent events without respiratory infection \no Recurrent witnessed seizure like events \no Required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \no Significantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate \nor lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other tests that suggest an inborn error \nof metabolism \n Significantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible \nchannelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or structural heart disease \n Family history of: \no Arrhythmia \no BRUE in sibling \no Developmental delay \no Inborn error of metabolism or genetic disease \no Long QT syndrome (LQTS) \no Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- \nor second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant \n \nBRUE \nBrief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) was previously known as apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE). In a practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is \ndefined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports \na sudden, brief (usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the \nfollowing: \n Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing \n Altered level of responsiveness \n Cyanosis or pallor \n Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia) \nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting \nan appropriate history and physical examination.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Syndromic hearing loss refers to hearing loss\nassociated with other medical or physical findings, including visible\nabnormalities of the external ear. Because syndromic hearing loss\noccurs as part of a syndrome of multiple clinical manifestations, it is\noften recognized more readily as hereditary. Nonsyndromic hearing\nloss is defined as hearing loss not associated with other physical\nsigns or symptoms. Nonsyndromic hearing loss accounts for 70% to\n80% of genetically determined deafness, and it is more difficult to\ndetermine whether the etiology is hereditary or acquired.\nThis policy primarily focuses on the use of genetic testing to identify a\ncause of suspected hereditary hearing loss. The diagnosis of\nsyndromic hearing loss can be made on the basis of associated\nclinical findings. However, at the time of hearing loss presentation,\nassociated clinical findings may not be apparent; furthermore,\nvariants in certain genetic loci may cause both syndromic and\nnonsyndromic hearing loss. Given this overlap, the policy focuses on\ngenetic testing for hereditary hearing loss more generally.\nIf there is not a high suspicion for a specific hearing loss etiology,\nideally the evaluation should occur in a stepwise fashion. About 50%\nof individuals with autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss have\npathogenic variants in the GJB2 gene, in the other 50% of patients\nwith apparent autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss;\nnumerous other genes are implicated. There is no single identifiable\ngene responsible for most cases of autosomal dominant hereditary\nhearing loss.\n25. 4. 8. 오후  4:15 Medical Policy | BCBSNE\nhttps://medicalpolicy.nebraskablue.com/Policy/219/9 1/7\n\nIf there is suspicion for autosomal recessive congenital hearing loss,\nit would be reasonable to begin with testing of GJB2 and GJB6 and if\ntesting is negative, screening for the other genes associated with\nhearing loss with a multigene panel would be efficient. An alternative\nstrategy for suspected autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant\nhearing loss would be to obtain a multigene panel that includes GJB2\nand GJB6 as a first step.\nGiven the extreme heterogeneity in genetic causes of hearing loss,\nthese 2 strategies may be considered reasonably equivalent.\nDates\nOriginal Effective\n07-21-2016\nLast R eview\n08-07-2024\nNext R eview\n08-11-2025\nRELATED POLICIES\nThis policy document provides coverage criteria for genetic testing for\nhereditary hearing loss.

Unless clinical and/or family history suggests a specific\ngenetic etiology, comprehensive HL gene panel testing should be\ninitiated.” (p. 9)\nThe guidelines also state the following: “Although nonsyndromic HL\n[hearing loss] demonstrates high genetic heterogeneity, the DFNB1\nlocus, which includes the GJB2 gene encoding the gap junction protein\nconnexin 26 and the GJB6 gene encoding the gap junction protein\nconnexin 30, accounts for an estimated 50% of all autosomal recessive\nnonsyndromic HL and 15% to 40% of all deaf individuals in a variety of\npopulations.” (p. 3)\nGeneReviews: Hereditary Hearing Loss and Deafness Overview\nGeneReviews is an expert-authored review of current literature on a\ngenetic disease, and goes through a rigorous editing and peer review\nprocess before being published online. \nIn the section that discusses possible differential diagnosis for\nhereditary hearing loss and deafness, it is stated that, In developed\ncountries approximately 65% of prelingual hearing loss is due to\ngenetic causes.  The remainder of cases are due to environmental\n(acquired) causes, which should be differentiated from genetic causes\nto inform the evaluation and required ancillary testing. Acquired\nhearing loss in children commonly results from prenatal infections\nfrom ‘TORCH’ organisms…or postnatal infections (such as CMV).\nAcquired hearing loss in adults is most often attributed to\nenvironmental factors.\nGeneReviews also states that molecular genetic testing includes the\nuse of multigene hearing loss panels and/or genomic testing.  Single-\ngene testing (sequence analysis of a given gene, followed by gene-\ntargeted deletion/duplication analysis) is rarely useful and typically\nNOT recommended. \n25. 4. 8. 오후  4:15 Medical Policy | BCBSNE\nhttps://medicalpolicy.nebraskablue.com/Policy/219/9 4/7\n\nQuick Code Search\nUse this feature to find out if a procedure and diagnosis code pair will be\napproved, denied or held for review.

Scientific Background   \nNeurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons along with deposition of \nmisfolded proteins throughout the body. These misfolded proteins have altered biochemical properties, causing dysfunction. Clinical symptoms may include cognitive decline (primarily dementia) and movement problems (cerebellar dysfunction, hyper - or hypo -kinesia, etc.). The molecular \nspectrum of these disorders may vary, but typically involve oxidative or neuroinflammatory damage (Kovacs, 2016) . \n \nAtaxias (including Friedreich ataxia)  \nAtaxias encompass the set of conditions that are characterized by “motor incoordination resulting \nfrom dysfunction of the cerebellum and its connections” (P. Opal & H.Y. Zoghbi, 2023) . This policy \nfocuses on progressive and degenerative ataxias, which are further subdivided into autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X -linked forms. \n Friedreich ataxia is the most common hereditary ataxia and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most cases are caused by mutations in the frataxin gene ( FXN), which is responsible for \ntransport and management of iron. The frataxin mutation is typically an expanded trinucleotide (GAA) repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene, which reduces expression of frataxin. Severity of \nphenotype varies with the nu mber of repeats; larger repeats are generally more severe. Impaired iron \nmanagement leads to a variety of clinical symptoms, such as neurological problems (progressive \nataxia, dysphagia, motor weakness, loss of tendon reflexes, etc.), cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and skeletal deformities. Clinical findings may suggest Friedreich ataxia, but diagnosis is generally confirmed through genetic testing (P Opal & H.Y. Zoghbi, 2023b) . \n Another autosomal recessive ataxia is ataxia- telangiectasia (AT). AT is caused by a defective gene on \nchromosome 11q22.3, leading to faulty DNA repair mechanisms. This gene (designated AT “M” for mutated) primarily regulates the cell cycle and prevents the  cell cycle from progressing if there is DNA \ndamage. When this gene fails, somatic mutations may accumulate. Symptoms such as immune deficiency, cerebellar ataxia, unusual eye movements, and other neurologic abnormalities are characteristic of ataxia-telan giectasia. Ataxia is one of the first clinical symptoms of patients with AT, \nbut other organ systems are usually affected, such as the skin and circulatory system. Similarly, ataxia-telangiectasia- like disorder (ATLD) can affect individuals similarly to AT ; however, ATLD is due to \nmutations within the MRE11A  gene involved in double -strand DNA break recognition and repair. The \nrate of neurodegeneration in ATLD is typically slower than AT. ATLD is more rare than AT; however, “it is estimated that as many as 5  percent of AT cases may be incorrectly diagnosed and actually have \nATLD, given the similarity in clinical manifestations and coding sizes of the two affected genes” (Opal, 2022) . \n Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are the most common autosomal dominant ataxias. At least 30 types of SCAs with varying phenotypes occur, although, cerebellar ataxia is a primary feature of each type. For example, SCA1 is characterized by dysarthria and bulbar dysfunction whereas SCA2 is characterized by “slow saccadic eye movements.” Several SCA types have a signature CAG repeat beyond what is present in the wildtype; this expansion is pathogenic. As with Friedreich ataxia, larger number of \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 8 of 34 \n \nrepeats usually lead to more severe symptoms. The four most common SCAs are SCA1, 2, 3, and 6, and \neach type is caused by a different pathogenic mutation. Below is a table displaying each SCA, its distinguishing features, and its primary associated gene (P Opal & H.Y. Zoghbi, 2023a) .  \nDisorder  Distinguishing features  Gene  \nSCA1  Pyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy  ATXN1  \nSCA2  Slow saccades; less often myoclonus, areflexia  ATXN2  \nSCA3 (MJD)  Slow saccades, persistent stare, extrapyramidal signs, peripheral neuropathy  ATXN3  \nSCA4  Sensory neuropathy  16q22.1  \nSCA5  Early onset but slow progression  SPTBN2  \nSCA6  May have very late onset, mild, may lack family history, nystagmus  CACNA1A  \nSCA7  Macular degeneration  ATXN7  \nSCA8  Mild disease  ATXN8, ATXN8OS  \nSCA9  Not assigned    \nSCA10  Generalized or complex partial seizures  ATXN10  \nSCA11  Mild disease  TTBK2  \nSCA12  Tremor, dementia  PPP2R2B  \nSCA13  Mental retardation  KCNC3  \nSCA14  Intermittent myoclonus with early onset disease  PRKCG  \nSCA15/16  Slowly progressive  ITPR1  \nSCA17 (or HDL4)1 Gait ataxia, dementia  TBP \nSCA18  Pyramidal signs, weakness, sensory axonal neuropathy  7q22 -q32 \nSCA19/22  Predominantly cerebellar syndrome, sometimes with cognitive impairment \nor myoclonus  KCND3  gene  \nSCA20  Palatal tremor and dysphonia  11q12  \nSCA21  Mild to severe cognitive impairment  TMEM240  \nSCA23  Distal sensory deficits  PDYN  \nSCA24  Recessive inheritance; redesignated as SCAR4  1p36  \nSCA25  Sensory neuropathy, facial tics, gastrointestinal symptoms  2p21 -p13 \nSCA26  Pure cerebellar ataxia  EEF2  \nSCA27  Cognitive impairment  FGF14  \nSCA28  Ophthalmoparesis and ptosis  AFG3L2  \nSCA29  Early onset, nonprogressive ataxia; may be an allelic variant of SCA15  3p26  \nSCA30  Slowly progressive, relatively pure ataxia  4q34.3 -q35.1  \nSCA31  Decreased muscle tone  BEAN  \nSCA32  Cognitive impairment; affected individuals with azoospermia and testicular \natrophy  7q32 -q33 \nSCA33  Not assigned    \nSCA34  Skin lesions consisting of papulosquamous erythematous ichthyosiform \nplaques  ELOVL4  \nSCA35  Late onset, slowly progressive gait and limb ataxia  TGM6  \nSCA36  Late onset, truncal ataxia, dysarthria, variable motor neuron disease and \nsensorineural hearing loss  NOP56  \nSCA37  Late onset, falls, dysarthria, clumsiness, abnormal vertical eye movements  1p32  \nSCA38   Slowly progressive pure cerebellar phenotype  ELOVL5  \nSCA39  Not assigned    \nSCA40  Hyperreflexia and spasticity  CCDC88  \nDRPLA  Chorea, seizures, myoclonus, dementia  ATN1  \n1SCA17 is synonymous with HDL4 (Huntington disease -like 4) (Toyoshima et al., 2012) .  \nJacobi et al. (2015)  described the disease progression of SCAs 1, 2, 3, and 6. A total of 462 patients \nwere evaluated on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Annual SARA score increase was 2.11 for SCA1 patients, 1.49 for SCA2, 1.56 for SCA3, and 0.80 for SCA6. The increase of \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 9 of 34 \n \nnon-ataxia signs plateaued in types 1, 2, and 3. SCA6 symptoms were found to increase more slowly \nthan the other three types. Factors associated with a faster increase of SARA score across all types \nwere short duration of follow -up, older age at inclusion (per additional year), and longer repeat \nexpansions (per additional repeat unit) (Jacobi et al., 2015) . \n Reetz et al. (2015) examined the effect of the number of GAA repeats in the FXN  gene on clinical \nsymptoms of Friedreich’s Ataxia (FA). A total of 592 patients with FA were sequenced and evaluated. The authors found that with every 100 GAA repeats, the age of onset was 2 -3 years earlier. Disease \nprogression was also found to be faster in patients with more repeats; the annual worsening of the \nScale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score was 1.04 points per year and 1.37 points per year for early and intermediate onset (≤14 and 15 -24 years, respectively), compared to 0.56 points \nper year for late -onset patients (≥25 years) (Reetz et al., 2015). \n Leotti et al. (2021)  examined the contribution that the expanded CAG repeat length has on the rate of \ndisease progression in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado -Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD). Expanded \nCAG repeat in ATXN3 is the mutation that causes SCA3/MJD, and the length of CAG repeat can determine the age of onset of clinical symptoms. The authors studied 82 patients with SCA3/MJD over 15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and found that “The length of the CAG repeat was positively correlate d with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the \ndifferences between patients.” The authors concluded that the length of CAG repeat in ATXN3 has major influence over clinical symptoms (Leotti et al., 2021) .  \n Schuermans et al. (2023)  performed an observational study to assess the diagnostic value of exome \nsequencing and multigene panel analysis for adult -onset neurologic disorders, including ataxias. In \n2019, 6 diagnostic gene panels were introduced at the center for Medical Genetics of the Ghent University Hospital to diagnose patients with neurologic disorders. One of these panels was for ataxia and spasticity and included 390 genes. While the most common ataxia genes were not included in this panel, only 33% of the diagnosed patient s had first been tested for SCAs, Friedrich ataxia, or fragile X \ntremor/ataxia syndrome. The panels included single nucleotide variants, small indels, and copy number variants. Of the panels and targeted patient populations examined by the authors, the mul ti-\ngene panel for ataxia and spasticity had the highest diagnostic yield, identifying the causal pathogenic variant (s) in 19% of the assessed patients (70 of 365) (Schuermans et al., 2023) . \n Dystonias  \nDystonias are a class of movement disorders characterized by “sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive movements, postures, or both” (Deik & Comelia, 2023) . Movements are typically twisting or patterned and are often worsened by voluntary action. The \nbasic neurochemistry of dystonia is unknown (and without consistent findings), and cell degeneration \nis typically not seen. However, some types of dystonia (particularly early -onset versions) have clear \nassociations with certain genes. For example, TOR1A  and THAP1  both carry pathogenic mutations for \nearly -onset dystonia. TOR1A  (DYT1 ) encodes a protein that binds to ATP (torsin A) while THAP1  (DYT6 ) \nencodes a tran scription regulator for torsin A (Deik & Comelia, 2023) . \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 10 of 34 \n \nDystonias are divided into classes or types. They can be focal (involving a single site), multifocal \nsegmental (involving region(s) of the body), generalized (involving the trunk and at least two additional sites), or hemidystonia (affecting only one side of the body). The etiology of the disorder can be either idiopathic or of known causation. Dystonias can be due to trauma or may be inherited. Those forms of proven genetic origin can be inherited in different inheritance patterns, including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X -linked recessive, or even mitochondrial inheritance. The most common \ninherited form of dystonia is DYT -TOR1A (or DYT1) dystonia. DYT -TOR1A accounts for approximately \n40-65% of early -onset generalized dystonia in populations other than the Ashkenazi Jewish population. \nWithin the latter population, DYT- TOR1A is estimated to account for 90% of these cases (Deik & \nComelia, 2023) . Even though DYT -TOR1A dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, the \npenetrance is only 30% (Bressman, 2004; Deik & Comelia, 2023; Ozelius & Lubarr, 2016) . Paroxysmal \ndyskinesia with dystonia (PKND) is a special class of dystonia that involves spontaneous episodes of dystonia. Several environmental factors have been proposed to precipitate these episodes, such as stress, caffeine, and fatigue. The primary g ene associated with PKND is MR1 , or DYT8 . Another special \nclass of dystonia is myoclonus -dystonia, which is characterized by short, involuntary movements of the \nneck or arms in addition to normal dystonia symptoms. The main established type of myoclonus -\ndystonia is caused by mutations in the SGCE  (DYT11 ) gene (Deik & Comelia, 2023) .  \n Zech et al. (2017)  performed whole exome sequencing on 16 patients with “genetically undefined \nearly -onset generalized dystonia.” Six patients had mutations of known dystonia -related genes. The \nmutated genes were GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A, ANO3 , and ADCY5 . The authors noted GCH1, THAP1 , and \nTOR1A  as associated with isolated, generalized dystonia and ANO3  and ADCY5  associated with a \ncombined myoclonus -dystonia phenotype (Zech et al., 2017) . \n Parkinsonism (Parkinson Disease, PD)  \nParkinsonism is a constellation of symptoms with “any combination of bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and postural instability.” The most common form of parkinsonism is Parkinson disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by d egeneration of dopaminergic neurons in \nthe brain (Chou, 2023b) . The pathogenesis of PD is driven by loss of dopamine from the basal ganglia \nin the brain; though a number of compensatory mechanisms may mitigate this loss of dopamine, the progression of disease eventually leads to clinical symptoms (Jankovic, 2023). The “cardinal” features of PD are “tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity”; postural instability is commonly considered a defining feature, yet it typically manifests late in the course of disease. Other motor symptoms such as dysphagia, blurred vision, shuf fling, are common; these secondary motor symptoms are commonly \nderived from the cardinal features. Nonmotor symptoms include cognitive deterioration, dementia, and other mood disorders (Chou, 2023a) . \n The exact cause of PD is unknown, but several genetic factors have been Identified. These genes do \nnot imply a particular phenotype, and each mutation vary in severity of symptomology. Genes \nassociated with PD are SNCA (PARK1/4), LRRK2 (PARK8), PINK1, PARK2, DJ- 1 (PARK7) , and GBA  \n(Jankovic, 2023).  GBA - (glucocerebrosidase) associated PD is coupled with the lysosomal storage condition known as \nGaucher disease, which is commonly seen in Ashkenazi Jews (Jankovic, 2023). Sidransky et al. (2009)  \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 11 of 34 \n \ncompared PD patients with a GBA mutation to those with PD but without a GBA  mutation, and they \nfound that the patients with a GBA  mutation had an earlier age of onset and greater chance of \ncognitive impairment, albeit with less pronounced cardinal features (Sidransky et al., 2009) . \nSNCA encodes alpha -synuclein. Although its exact role is not well understood, it is thought to function \nin synaptic plasticity and makes up as much as 1 percent of total central nervous system protein. \nObservations suggest a role for mutated alpha -synuclein in  the pathogenesis of PD; for example, Lewy \nbodies, the primary pathologic hallmark of PD, have insoluble, aggregated alpha -synuclein as a major \ncomponent. It may also be possible for misfolded alpha- synuclein to be transmitted from diseased \nneurons to healthy ones. PARK1  refers to a missense mutation in SNCA whereas PARK4  refers to a \nmultiplication (Jankovic, 2023). \n LRRK2  (leucine -rich repeat kinase -2) encodes a protein called dardarin. Dardarin is thought to function \nas a kinase for phosphorylation of certain proteins, such as alpha- synuclein and microtubule -\nassociated protein tau. Dardarin may also be implicated in membrane and protein transport. The  \nphenotype of LRRK2  mutations is noted to be less severe than other genotypes of PD; patients have \nbeen observed to respond to levodopa, have a later age of onset, and less severe cognitive deterioration (Jankovic, 2023) . \n PARK2  encodes a protein called parkin. This protein is associated with degradation of certain proteins \nin wild -type genes; the mutated version of parkin cannot clear proteins, allowing them to aggregate in \nthe neuron. This mutation typically leads to an early -age onset of PD and clinical symptoms, although \nthe severity of these early symptoms does not appear to be significantly worse than other genotypes (Jankovic, 2023).  DJ-1 and PINK1  are both associated with autosomal recessive inheritance and early age of onset (under \n50 for PINK1  mutations, under 40 for DJ -1 mutations). PINK1  mutations are possibly associated with \nmitochondrial dysfunction whereas DJ-1 mutations may lead to increased neuro -oxidative stress \n(Jankovic, 2023). \n \nNalls et al. (2014)  performed a meta -analysis of genome -wide association studies on PD. A common \nset of 7893274 variants with 13708 cases and 95282 controls were evaluated. Thirty -two loci were \nidentified as having genome -wide significant association. These 32 loci were re -tested in an \nindependent set of 5353 cases and 5551 controls, and 24 of these loci replicated their significance. Four loci ( GBA, GAK -DGKQ, SNCA, HLA region) were considered to have a “secondary independent risk \nvariant.” The authors noted that the effect of each individual loci was small, but cumulative risk was “substantial” (Nalls et al., 2014) . \n Maple -Grødem et al. (2021)  studied the significance of glucocerebrosidase gene ( GBA ) carrier status on \nmotor impairment in patients with incident PD. The authors studied 528 patients with PD, using genomic DNA assessment and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). GBA  carriers had a \nfaster annual increase in UPDRS score than non -carriers. The authors conclude that “ GBA  variants are \nlinked to a more aggressive motor disease course over 7 years from diagnosis in patients with PD” (Maple -Grødem et al., 2021) . \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 12 of 34 \n \nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  \nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that causes significant \nmotor neuron degeneration all over the body. This causes a variety of neuromuscular problems, such as spasticity, weakness, atrophy, hyperreflexia, cogn itive impairment, and eventual death. ALS is \ndivided into two categories: sporadic (90% of cases) and familial (10%) (Elman et al., 2023) .  \n The primary genes tested in ALS cases are superoxide dismutase ( SOD1 ) and chromosome 9 open \nreading frame 72 ( C9ORF72 ), both of which lead to familial ALS. The enzyme SOD1 catalyzes toxic \nsuperoxide radicals to O2 and H2O2. The mutation thought to be the primary cause of SOD1- mediated \ntoxicity is a gain- of-function mutation, creating many reactive oxygen species. Other hypotheses of \nSOD1 -mediated toxicity include misfolded proteins caused by SOD1  mutations and production of \nprotein aggregates that damage motor neurons (Maragakis, 2023) . \n C9ORF72  expansions are another common cause of familial ALS. This mutation is a hexanucleotide \nrepeat (GGGGCC) that forms a structure called the G -quadruplex. The exact pathogenic mechanism is \nunknown, but some hypotheses include creation of defective RNA transcr ipts and creation of toxic \ndipeptide proteins that cause RNA processing to falter (Maragakis, 2023) . \n Chiò et al. (2012)  evaluated the genetic landscape of ALS in an Italian cohort. A total of 475 patients \nwere examined, and 51 were noted to carry a mutation associated with ALS. Familial ALS was found in 46 of these patients, and 31 of these 46 were found to have a genetic mutation (leaving 20 mutations in the remaining 429 sporadic cases). After performing a logistic regression, the authors found that the chance to carry a genetic mutation was related to the presence of comorbid frontotemporal dementia by an odds ratio of 3 .5 (Chiò et al., 2012) . \n Vajda et al. (2017)  evaluated clinician opinion on genetic testing in ALS. Responses from 167 clinicians \nin 21 countries were analyzed. Approximately 90.2% of respondents were found to have offered genetic testing to patients they defined as having familial ALS and 49.4% to patients with sporadic ALS. \nThe four main genes tested were SOD1, C9ORF72, TARDBP , and FUS . Further, 42% of respondents did \nnot offer genetic testing to asymptomatic family members of patients with familial ALS (Vajda et al., \n2017) . \n Bandres -Ciga et al. (2019)  used publicly available genome -wide association studies to identify shared \npolygenic risk genetic factors and casual associations in 20,806 ALS cases and 59,804 controls. Positive associations were found with smoking and moderate physical activity levels,  and negative associations \nwere found with higher education, cognitive performance, and light physical activity levels. Further, the authors report that “hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci o f interest” (Bandres -Ciga et al., 2019) .  \n Wilson Disease (WD)  \nWilson disease (WD) is a condition caused by defective copper transport. This leads to accumulation of copper in several organs, such as the brain, eyes, and liver. Eventually, the liver becomes cirrhotic, while other neurological conditions may develop. T he primary gene handling hepatocyte copper \ntransport is ATP7B . Normally, this gene mediates the transport of copper into apoceruloplasmin, which \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 13 of 34 \n \nis then secreted into the bloodstream. Mutations in this gene cause impaired binding of copper to the \nprotein, causing copper accumulation in the hepatocyte and eventually the bloodstream (Schilsky, 2022) . \n Dong et al. (2016)  evaluated the genetic spectrum of WD in Chinese patients. A total of 632 patients \nwith WD were compared against 503 controls. Further, 161 variants were found in the WD patents, and 142 were considered pathogenic or “likely pathogenic.” The authors conclu ded that 569 of the 632 \npatients (90%) could be diagnosed with two or more “likely pathogenic” or worse variants. Finally, the 14 most common variants were found at least once in 537 of the 569 (94%) genetically diagnosed \npatients (Dong et al., 2016) . \n \nHuntington Disease (HD)  \nHuntington disease (HD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by choreiform (brief, abrupt, and involuntary) movements, psychiatric disorders, and eventual dementia. During the early stages of the disease, patients may be able to funct ion day -to-day and perform typical tasks; \nhowever, as the disease progresses, patients lose their ability to function independently and require assistance. In the late stages of the disease, patients often become bedridden as cognitive and motor ability continues to decline, with death occurring 10 to 40 years after onset. Currently there is no cure, and the disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (Suchowersky, 2023) . \n Huntington disease is primarily caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. A cytosine -adenine -\nguanine “repeat” encodes for polyglutamine tracts in the huntingtin ( HTT) gene, and the “expansion” \nrefers to additional repeats of this trinucleotide side. Approximately 6 -26 CAG repeats is considered \nwild -type, 27 -35 repeats is considered intermediate (i.e. typically do not cause disease but may expand \nin future generations) , and ≥36 repeats is considered diagnostic of HD. CAG repeat length is considered \nto corr elate with both rate of disease progression and severity of neurological changes. The CAG \nrepeat expansion leads to a toxic “gain -of-function” of the HTT  protein, and although the exact \nfunction of this huntingtin protein is unknown, it interacts with several different proteins, implying \nthat it has a function in several cellular events. Mutant huntingtin is seen to disrupt transcription, \nactivation of pro teases, synaptic transmission, and more (Zoghbi & Orr, 2022). \n Baig et al. (2016)  reviewed 22 years of predictive testing performed by the UK’s Huntington \nConsortium. A total of 9407 predictive tests were performed over 23 testing centers, with 8441 tests on individuals considered at 50% predictive risk. Of these 8441, 4629 were mutation negative and 3790 were mutation positive (with 22 tests as “uninterpretable”). A prevalence figure of 12.3 x 10\n—5 \nwas used to evaluate the “cumulative uptake” of predictive testing at the 50% risk level; this amount was calculated to be 17.4% (the number of individuals at 50% risk that had undergone predictive testing). The authors concluded that the majority of indiv iduals at risk for HD had not undergone \npredictive testing (Baig et al., 2016) . \n Spinal Muscular Atrophies (SMA)  \nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) disorders encompass the set of disorders that are characterized by the degeneration of anterior “horn” cells in the spinal cord and motor nuclei in the lower brainstem. This leads to muscle weakness and atrophy, although cogni tion is unaffected. There are currently five main \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 14 of 34 \n \ntypes of SMA, types 0 to 4. These types are organized by age of onset and clinical presentation, with \ntypes 0 and 1 presenting earliest and with the most severe symptoms and type 4 as the least severe phenotype. For example, type 0 presents prenatally and death occurs by six months, whereas type 4 patients usually remain ambulatory and have a normal lifespan (Bodamer, 2023) .  \n The primary gene mutation occurs in the survival motor neuron 1 ( SMN1 ) gene. This gene encodes a \nprotein that appears to play a role in mRNA synthesis. The most common mutation in SMN1  is a \ndeletion of exon 7, representing up to 94% of SMA patients. Another gene, SMN2 , may cause \nphenotypic changes in SMN1  due to its effect as a gene modifier. SMN2 encodes an extremely similar \nprotein to SMN1  (only one nucleotide difference), and it may compensate for SMN1  loss. Severity of \nSMA correlates inversely with amount of SMN2 gene copy numbers, which varies from 0 to 8 \n(Bodamer, 2023) . \n Zarkov et al. (2015)  evaluated the association between clinical symptoms and SMN2  gene copy \nnumbers. Forty -three patients with SMA were examined, and 37 of them had homozygous deletions of \nSMN1 exon 7. The genetic characterization of these 37 patients were as follows: “One had SMA type I \nwith 3 SMN2 copies, 11 had SMA type II with 3.1 +/ - 0.7 copies, 17 had SMA type III with 3.7 +/ - 0.9 \ncopies, while 8 had SMA type IV with 4.2 +/ - 0.9 copies.” T he authors concluded that “a higher SMN2 \ngene copy number correlated with less severe disease phenotype,” but they noted that potential other \nphenotype modifiers could not be ignored (Zarkov et al., 2015) . \n \nHereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP)  \nHereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) represents a group of genetic neurodegenerative diseases characterized by increased spasticity of the lower limbs over time (Shribman et al., 2019). Spastic gait is often the only, or main, feature of the syndrome; bladder dysfunction is a common clinical finding as well. More than 70 types of HSP have been identified, and are often due to axon degeneration, leading to progressive degeneration of the corticospinal tracts (Fink, 2014; Opal & Ajroud -Driss, 2022) . The \nclassification of HSP may be based on age of onset, rate of progression, degree of spasticity, and \ngenetics with more than 55 loci related to the disease (Opal & Ajroud -Driss, 2022) . Some of the more \ncommon autosomal dominant forms of HSP may be caused by mutations in the ATL1, SPAST, \nKIAA1096,  KIF5A,  and REEP1  genes; additional genes are associated with autosomal recessive forms, x -\nlinked forms, and mitochondrial forms of HSP (Opal & Ajroud -Driss, 2022) . \n Dong et al. (2018)  performed next- generation sequencing on 149 genes associated with HSP in a \ncohort of 99 individuals. A retrospective study on other patients with HSP was also completed. Different genetic mutations cause different subtypes of HSP such as SPG4, SPG3A, and SPG6. The researchers note that “In ADHSP [autosomal dominant HSP], we found that SPG4 (79%) was the most prevalent [subtype], followed by SPG3A (11%), SPG6 (4%) and SPG33 (2%)… In ARHSP [autosomal \nrecessive HSP], the most common subtype was SPG11 (53%), f ollowed by SPG5 (32%), SPG35 (6%) and \nSPG46 (3%)” (Dong et al., 2018) . \n \nIn 2018, GeneReview published an updated overview of HSP. This overview was last updated in 2021. This document states the following regarding genetic testing:  \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 15 of 34 \n \n• “Concurrent or serial single -gene testing can be considered if clinical findings and/or family \nhistory indicate that involvement of a particular gene or small subset of genes is most likely (see \nTables 1, 2, 3, and 4)”  \n• “A multigene panel that includes some or all of the genes listed in Table 1 is most likely to identify the genetic cause of the condition at the most reasonable cost while limiting identification of variants of uncertain significance and pathogenic variant s in genes that do not \nexplain the underlying phenotype” \n• “Comprehensive genomic testing (which does not require the clinician to determine which gene[s] are likely involved) may be considered. Exome sequencing is most commonly used; genome sequencing is also possible. Exome array (when clinically available) may be considered if exome sequencing is not diagnostic”  \n• “Recommendations for the evaluation of parents of a proband with an apparent de novo  \npathogenic variant include molecular genetic testing of both parents for the pathogenic variant identified in the proband” (Hedera, 2021) . \n•  \nGeneReviews has published four tables (below) which show the genes associated with autosomal dominant HSP, autosomal recessive HSP, X -linked HSP, and maternal (mitochondrial) HSP.  \n Table 1: Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia: Genes and Distinguishing Clinical

Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  \nItalian Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Genetic (ITALSGEN)  Consortium  \nThe following guidelines were created as a result from a workshop on ALS genetic testing.  \n• “All ALS patients who have a first -degree or second -degree relative with ALS, frontotemporal \ndementia or both, should be offered genetic testing. At present, however, we do not \nrecommend offering genetic testing to sporadic ALS patients, outside research protocols.”  \n• “Genetic testing at present is not indicated in asymptomatic at -risk subjects and, therefore, \nshould not be proposed.”  \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 23 of 34 \n \n• The guidelines also note that “two -thirds of mutations are found in four genes, C9ORF72, SOD1, \nTARDBP and FUS.” Therefore, they state that these genes should be “considered” for routine \ndiagnostic protocol. Furthermore, they note that C9ORF72 testing is “worthwhile” in sporadic \npatients. If these 4 genes are negative, other ALS -related genes may be tested. Finally, UBQLN2  \nis a gene that should be tested if there is suspicion of an X -linked dominant inheritance (Chio et \nal., 2014) . \n•  \nALS Association  \nThe ALS Association published information on genetic testing on their website. They state that \n“Knowing whether your ALS is connected to a specific gene mutation could make you eligible for ongoing clinical trials testing treatments targeted at specific ge nes.” The guidelines go on to state that \n“if genetic testing identifies a disease -causing genetic mutation in a person with ALS, their family \nmembers generally have the option to pursue testing themselves” but note that this is a personal decision with sig nificant costs and benefits (ALSA, 2023) .  \n Ataxias (including Friedreich ataxia)  \nEuropean Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) and European Neurological Society  (ENS)  \nThe EFNS -ENS released joint guidelines on diagnosis and management of chronic ataxias in adulthood. \nTheir genetic testing guidelines are listed below:  \n“In the case of a family history that is compatible with an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, screening for SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17 is recommended (level B). In Asian patients, DRPLA should also be tested for.”  \n“If mutation analysis is negative, we recommend contact with or a referral to a specialized clinic for reviewing the clinical phenotype and further genetic testing (good practice point).”  \n \nI\nn the case of a family history compatible with an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, they \nrecommend a three -s\ntep diagnostic approach.  \nS\ntep 1 includes mutation analysis of the FRDA gene for Friedreic’'s ataxia (although one can refrain \nfrom this in the case of severe cerebellar atrophy).  \nStep 2 includes mutation analysis of the SACS , POLG , Aprataxin ( APTX ) and SPG7  genes (taking into \naccount specific phenotypes).  \nStep 3 includes “referral to a specialized centre, e.g. for skin or muscle biopsy targeted at diagnoses such as Niemann−Pick type C, recessive ataxia with coenzyme Q deficiency [aarF domain containing kinase 3 (ADCK3)/autosomal recessive spinocerebellar at axia 9 (SCAR9)] and mitochondrial \ndisorders, or for extended genetic screening using gene panel diagnostics.”  \n \n“In the case of sporadic ataxia and independent from onset age, we recommend routine testing for \nSCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6 and DRPLA (in Asian patients) (level B)”(van de Warrenburg et al., 2014) . \n Friedreich’'s Ataxia Research Alliance (FARA)  The FARA notes genetic diagnostic information on their website.  \nThey state that in “more than 95% of abnormal alleles, the mutation is expansion of naturally occurring GAA repeat in first intron (non -coding region) of the frataxin or FRDA gene.”  \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 24 of 34 \n \n“Genetic testing results in ~98% detection in symptomatic individuals. In rare cases, analysis of \nfrataxin protein levels can be helpful to confirming or ruling out a diagnosis…Carrier testing is recommended for anyone with a positive family history of Friedreich ataxia and for partners of known carriers. Presymptomatic testing for at -risk siblings/relatives is available, however genetic \ncounseling is strongly recommended to assist individuals/families in considering the risks vs benefits for testing an unt reatable genetic condition” (FARA, 2022). \n An expert working group was convened to review and provide guidelines for FA. This working group reviewed guidelines from a variety of different societies, and drafted their own guidelines based off \ntheir review. Their genetic testing items are as follows:  \n“Any individual in whom the diagnosis of FRDA is considered should undergo genetic testing for \nFRDA.”  \n“Referral to a clinical geneticist or genetic counselor should be considered on diagnosis of FRDA.”  \n“Requests for pre -symptomatic genetic testing are best managed on a case -by-case basis; there is \nno evidence to support the routine provision or refusal of pre -symptomatic genetic testing for \nFRDA.”  \n“The committee did not reach consensus on the issue of whether it is appropriate to conduct presymptomatic testing in a minor. Where a request for presymptomatic testing in a minor occurs, the individual/family should be referred to a team with expertise in this field for discussion about \npre-symptomatic genetic testing in which the risks and benefits of pre -symptomatic genetic \ndiagnosis are put forward. The risks and benefits from both the child’s and parents’ perspectives \nshould be carefully reviewed during the pre -test assessment.”  \n“All patients identified pre -symptomatically and their families would benefit from immediate post -\ntest counseling and psychosocial support and referral for appropriate neurological and cardiac surveillance.”  \n“Carrier testing should be first undertaken on the closest relative” (Corben et al., 2014) . \n For Friedreich Ataxia due to compound heterozygosity for a FXN  Intron 1 GAA expansion and point \nmutation/insertion/deletion:  \n“If a person compound heterozygous for a FXN  GAA expansion and a point \nmutation/insertion/deletion has a similar phenotype to those with FRDA due to homozygosity for GAA expansions, they should be managed as per the guidelines in this document.”  \n“If spastic ataxia is the predominant phenotype, then the main management issue is that of spasticity and the guidelines for management of spasticity should be followed” (Corben et al., 2014) . \n Ataxia UK  \nGenetic tests are recommended as part of the secondary care regimen for ataxia. The secondary care is divided into “first line” and “second line” for adults.  \n The first line genetic tests are for: FRDA, SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 (12, 17), and FXTAS. The second line genetic tests are for any remaining genes (de Silva et al., 2019) . The guidelines list genes associated with types \nof ataxia (Bonney et al., 2016) . \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 25 of 34 \n \nSpinocerebellar ataxias:  \nType \n(SC )  Gene  \n1 ATXN1  \n2 ATXN2  \n3 ATXN3  \n5 SPTBN2  \n6 CACNA1A  \n7 ATXN7  \n8 ATXN8OS  \n10 ATXN10  \n11 TTBK2  \n12 PPP2R2B  \n13 KCNC3  \n14 PRKCG  \n15/16  ITPR1  \n17 TBP \n19/22  KDND3  \n23 PDYN  \n27 FGF14  \n28 AFG3L2  \n31 BEAN1  \n35 TGM6  \n36 NOP56  \n38 ELOVL5  \n40 CCDC88C  \n41 TRPC3  \n \nThe guidelines note that the clinical validity of genetic testing for SCA8 by CAG repeat sizing has not been determined. Therefore, SCA8 should not be offered as a routine test if family history is unknown. However, testing may be appropriate in “large ped igrees where the expansion has been proven to be \nsegregating with the disease” (Bonney et al., 2016) . \n SCAs are considered autosomal dominant ataxias. Autosomal dominant ataxias also include GSS, DRPLA, POLG1, and EA types 1 and 2.  \n \nAutosomal reccessive ataxia genes include FXN  (Frederich’s Ataxia), APTX, SETX, SACS, SPG7, ATM, and \nTTPA  (Ataxia with Vitamin E deficiency).  \n \nMitochondrial Ataxias include NARP, MELAS, and MERRF.  \n X-Linked Ataxias include FXTAS (Fragile X associated Tremor and Ataxia Syndrome).  \n \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 26 of 34 \n \nFor children, second -line diagnostic tests for chronic ataxias include DNA testing for the FXN  gene is \nrecommended for suspected Frederich’s Ataxia, ATM  testing is recommended for suspected ataxia -\ntelangiectasia, and general DNA testing is recommended for “other conditions.” Finally, “genetic \ntesting of asymptomatic ‘at -risk’ minors is not generally recommended, but should be considered on a \ncase -by-case basis” (Bonney et al., 2016) . \n National Ataxia Foundation (NAF)  \nThe National Ataxia Foundation published a “Frequently Asked Questions” document regarding genetic testing for hereditary ataxias. For diagnostic testing, they noted that in sporadic ataxia cases \n(no prior family history of ataxia), genetic testing should only be done after non -genetic causes of \nataxia have been excluded. For predictive testing, a patient “must” know what type of ataxia is present \nin their family to be eligible (NAF, 2015) . \n Dystonias  \nEuropean Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS)  \nThe EFNS has released guidelines on the genetic testing of dystonias, which are listed below:  \n“Genetic testing should be performed after establishing the clinical diagnosis. Genetic testing is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of dystonia without clinical features of dystonia (level B). Genetic counselling is recommended.”  \n \n“D\nYT1 testing is recommended for patients with limb -o\nnset, primary dystonia with onset before age \n30 (level B), as well as in those with onset after age 30 if they have an affected relative with early -\no\nnset dystonia (level B).” \n “\nIn dystonia families, DYT1  testing is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals (good practice \npoint).”  \n \n“D\nYT6 testing is recommended in early -o\nnset dystonia or familial dystonia with cranio -c\nervical \npredominance or after exclusion of DYT1 (good practice point).” \n \n“\nIndividuals with early -o\nnset myoclonus affecting the arms or neck, particularly if positive for \nautosomal\n-d\nominant inheritance and if triggered by action, should be tested for the DYT11  gene \n(good practice point). If direct sequencing of the SGCE gene is negative, gene dosage studies increase the proportion of mutation\n-p\nositives (level C).”  \n “\nDiagnostic testing for the PNKD gene (DYT8 ) is recommended in symptomatic individuals with \nPNKD (good practice point).”  \n \n“\nGene testing for mutation in GLUT1  is recommended in patients with paroxysmal exercise\n-i\nnduced \ndyskinesias, especially if involvement of GLUT1  is suggested by low CSF/serum glucose ratio, \nepileptic seizures or haemolytic anaemia (good practice point)” (Albanese et al., 2011) . \n Th\ne EFNS also released guidelines on the diagnosis of Huntington’s Disease. In it, they recommend \nthat “diagnostic testing for HD is recommended (Level B) when a patient presents with an otherwise \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 27 of 34 \n \nunexplained clinical syndrome of a progressive choreatic movement disorder and neuropsychiatric \ndisturbances with or without a positive family history of the disease” (Harbo et al., 2009) . \n \nHereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP)  \nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD)  \nNORD has published a webpage on HSP. This page states that “Individuals seeking genetic counseling for HSP are recommended to consult a genetic counselor or medical geneticist for specific information”; further, “Genetic testing is often helpful in confirming the clinical diagnosis of HSP and in determining the genetic type of HSP. Results of genetic testing can be used, together with clinical \ninformation, to provide genetic counseling” (NORD, 2017). \n Regarding genetic testing for a HSP diagnosis, NORD states that “Testing for HSP genes is available and performed for individual HSP genes, for panels containing dozens of HSP genes, and by analysis of all genes (whole exome and whole genome analysis). Genetic testing is often helpful to confirm the clinical diagnosis of HSP. Genetic testing is most often able to find causative gene mutations for subjects with HSP who have a family history of a similarly affected first -degree relative. Despite \ndiscovery of more than 60 genes in which mutations cause various types of HSP, many individuals with HSP do not have an identified gene mutation… at present, genetic testing results very rarely influence treatment which is largely directed toward reducing symptoms” (NORD, 2017). \n \nHuntington Disease (HD)  \nWorking Group on Genetic Counselling and Testing of the European Huntington's Disease Network (EHDN)  \nThis Working Group was convened to provide guidelines for diagnostic genetic testing for HD. The guidelines list four groups that “should be considered” for genetic testing.  \n• The first group is “the patient with a positive family history and specific motor symptoms.” The authors note that diagnosis of this group is “not difficult” and that the test may be “little more than a formality.”  \n• The second group is “the patient with no family history, but specific symptoms likely to be HD.” The authors consider diagnostic testing of this group to be “most clinically useful.”  \n• The third group is “the patient with a positive family history and prodromal symptoms, which suggest the impending onset of HD.” The authors state that the motor abnormalities are part of the diagnostic criteria, but other symptoms such as behavioral chang es or other mental \nconditions may present in HD.  \n• The fourth group“is \"the child with a family history of HD and features of juvenile HD.” The authors note this group as challenging to diagnose, and alludes to diagnostic criteria set forth by Nance, which are as follows:  \no “a known family history of HD (often, but not exclusively, the father)  \no and two or more of \n declining school performance  \n Seizures  \n oral motor dysfunction  \n Rigidity  \n gait disturbance” (Craufurd et al., 2015)  \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 28 of 34 \n \nAnother Working Group was convened to evaluate the predictive testing guidelines for HD in 2013. In \nthose guidelines, they noted that HD testing should not be part of routine blood work and that patients under 18 should not be tested. However, they state that genetic counseling should be offered to those desiring to take the test (MacLeod et al., 2013) . MacLeod et al. (2013) was affirmed by the \nAmerican Association of Neurology on January 14, 2014 (AAN, 2014) . \nThe EDHN performed a literature review of scientific and consensual guidelines in 2019. The only major change had to do with deutetrabenazine (Grade A) as a treatment. Other studies were in agreement wiuth previously noted guidelines and recommendations (Bachoud -Lévi et al., 2019) . \n \nParkinsonism (Parkinson Disease, PD)  \nEuropean Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) and Movement Disorder Society –European \nSection (MDS -ES)  \nThese guidelines were created by a Task Force comprised of members from both societies. Their \ngenetic testing recommendations for Parkinson disease are listed below:  \n• “\nTesting for SNCA  point mutations and gene multiplications is recommended only in families \nwith multiple affected members in more than one generation suggestive of dominant inheritance, with early\n- o\nr late -o\nnset PD.”  \n• “L\nRRK2  genetic testing for counselling purposes, specifically directed at known pathogenic \nvariants is recommended in patients with a clinical picture of typical PD and a positive family history suggestive of dominant inheritance.”  \n• “In sporadic patients, genetic testing should be limited to the search for known LRRK2  founder \nmutations in the appropriate populations (i.e. with known high mutation frequencies).”  \n• “Genetic testing for GBA  gene mutations is recommended in patients with typical PD with or \nwithout a positive family history, limited to the known founder mutations of established \npathogenic role in the appropriate populations.” \n• “\nGenetic testing of the parkin, PINK1  and DJ\n-1 g\nenes for counselling purposes is recommended \nin patients with typical PD and positive family history compatible with recessive inheritance, \nparticularly when the disease onset is before the age of 50 years. For sporadic cases, parkin, PINK1  and DJ\n-\n1 genetic testing is recommended when onset is very early, particularly before the \nage of 40.”  \n• “\nTesting of the ATP13A2, PLA2G6 and FBXO7  genes might be considered in cases with very -\ne\narly-o\nnset PD, if no mutation in parkin,  PINK1  and DJ-1 ge\nne has been found.” \n \nF\nor recommendation III, the guideline lists Ashkenazi Jews, North African Arabs, and Basques as \nexamples of high mutation frequency populations (Berardelli et al., 2013) . \nSpinal Muscular Atrophies (SMA)  \n \n218th European Neuromuscular Centre (ENMC) International Workshop  Researchers, industry representatives, and other representatives from SMA Europe convened to review the current knowledge on the standards of care for SMA. Regarding genetic testing, they noted that “there was consensus that genetic testing is the first li ne investigation when this condition is \nsuspected in a typical case and that muscle biopsy or electromyography should not be performed in a typical presentation. There was also consensus that, at variance with previous recommendations, the current gold standard is SMN1  deletion/mutation and SMN2 copy number testing, with a minimal \n^\n\n \n  \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nAHS – M2167 – Genetic Testing for Neurodegenerative Disorders  Page 29 of 34 \n \nstandard of SMN1  deletion testing. Other areas concerning the value of SMN2 copy number were \nmore controversial and a further Delphi round was planned to complete the task” (Finkel et al., 2017) .  \n“Diagnostic testing for HD is recommended (Level B) when a patient presents with an otherwise \nunexplained clinical syndrome of a progressive choreatic movement disorder and neuropsychiatric disturbances with or without a positive family history of the dise ase” (Finkel et al., 2017).   \n American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)  ACOG recommended SMA screening for all individuals “considering pregnancy or are currently pregnant.” ACOG also noted that if one parent had a family history of SMA, the other parent should be \ntested for SMN1  deletion if molecular reports for the first parent were not available. These guidelines \nwere reaffirmed in 2021 (ACOG, 2017). \n Wilson Disease (WD)  \nHepatology Committee of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)  \nESPGHAN has published a position paper regarding Wilson disease in children. The genetic testing-relevant items are listed below:  \n The paper stated that the scoring system used for diagnosis of Wilson’s Disease included identification \nof a pathogenic mutation, which was considered one point (the scoring system is as follows: 0 -1: \nunlikely, 2 -3: probable, 4+, highly likely). The paper also notes that if biochemical and clinical \nsymptoms are present, only one mutation needs to be identified to diagnose Wilson disease. If the \npatient is asymptomatic, two mutations must be identified to diagnose “with certainty.” The diagnostic protocol ca lls for biochemical (copper metabolism testing), liver (ALT/AST, bilirubin, et al), and clinical \nevaluation before proceeding to molecular testing, and ATP7B  is the primary gene mutation \nmentioned in evaluation of Wilson disease.  \n \n“Genetic counseling is essential for families of patients with WD, and screening first -degree relatives is \nrecommended by both European and American guidelines.”  \n “It is essential to screen siblings of any patient newly diagnosed with WD because the chance of being a homozygote and developing clinical disease is 25%. Assessment should include physical examination, serum ceruloplasmin, liver function tests, and molecular testing for ATP7B  mutations or haplotype \nstudies if not available. Newborn screening is not warranted and screening may be delayed until 1 to 2 years of age” (Socha et al., 2018) . \n \nVI.
