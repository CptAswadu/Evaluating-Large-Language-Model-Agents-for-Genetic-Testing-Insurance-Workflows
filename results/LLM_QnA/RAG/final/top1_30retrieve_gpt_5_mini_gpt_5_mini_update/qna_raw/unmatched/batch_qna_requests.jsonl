Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family .

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

Policy Description  \n \nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is the strategy of using next -generation technology to sequence the \nentire genome. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) refers to sequencing of the exome, the component of \nthe genome that predominantly encode proteins. Next generation  sequencing (NGS) involves \nsequencing of multiple small fragments of DNA in parallel, producing fast, accurate sequencing results \n(Hulick, 2024).  \n \nThis policy is applicable for undiagnosed rare germline disorders.  \n \nII. Indications and/or Limitations of Coverage  \n \nApplication of coverage criteria is dependent upon an individual’s benefit coverage at the time of the \nrequest. Specifications pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid can be found in the “Applicable State and \nFederal Regulations” section of this policy documen t. \n \n1) For the evaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in individuals less \nthan 18 years of age , whole exome sequencing (WES) and comparator analysis (e.g., \nparents/siblings) WES MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA when all of the following criteria are met:  \n \na) When the individual has been evaluated by an ABMGG  board -certified medical geneticist or an \nABGC board -certified genetic counselor (CGC)  and has been counseled about the potential risks \nof genetic testing;  \nb) When the WES results will impact patient management and clinical outcome for the individual \nbeing tested;  \nc) When a genomic  etiology is the most likely explanation for the phenotype;  \nd) When no other causative circumstances (e.g., environmental exposures, injury, infection) can \nexplain the symptoms;  \ne) When the clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single -gene or \ntargeted panel testing (e.g., comparative genomic hybridization/chromosomal microarray \nanalysis) is available;  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 2 of 25 \n \nf) When the differential diagnosis list and/or phenotype warrant testing of multiple genes and \none of the following:  \n \ni) WES is more practical than the separate single gene tests or panels that would be \nrecommended based on the differential diagnosis.  \nii) WES results may preclude the need for multiple and/or invasive procedures, follow -up, or \nscreening that would be recommended in the absence of testing.  \n \n2) For a fetus with ultrasound anomalies, WES and comparator analysis (e.g., parents/siblings) WES \nMEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA  when all of the following criteria are met:  \n \na) When pre -test counseling has been provided by an ABMGG  board -certified medical geneticist \nor an ABGC board -certified genetic counselor (CGC) ; \nb) When standard chromosomal microarray testing (CMA) and karyotype analysis have failed to \nyield a definitive diagnosis;  \nc) When a genomic  etiology is the most likely explanation for the phenotype;  \nd) When no other causative circumstances (e.g., environmental exposures, injury, infection) can \nexplain the symptoms;  \ne) When clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single -gene or \ntargeted panel testing is available. If a specific diagnosis is suspected, molecular testing for the \nsuggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) should be the initial test.  \n \n3) Reanalysis of exome sequencing (ES) data with WES and comparator analysis (e.g., parents/siblings) \nWES MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA  for any of the following situations : \n \na) For individuals less than 18 years of age  with initial negative ES results as an aid in clinical \ndiagnosis when additional phenotypic findings are noted during a child’s growth and \ndevelopment.  \nb) For diagnostic results and results deemed to be possibly (but not definitively) associated with \nthe fetal phenotype (new gene -disease associations might have been unknown at the time of \ninitial diagnosis).  \nc) For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, if a new phenotype develops in the proband \nafter birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant amount of time has passed (at least \n12 months) since the initial testing was performed.  \nd) If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time . \n \n4) When WES is unable to identify a causative mutation and the clinical suspicion of a genomic etiology \nremains in situations where any of the above criteria are met in their entirety, whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA.  \n \nThe following does not meet coverage criteria due to a lack of available published scientific literature \nconfirming that the test(s) is/are required and beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment of an \nindividual’s illness.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 3 of 25 \n \n \n5) If WES has been previously performed, further genetic tests involving only exome analyses DO NOT \nMEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \n6) Focused exome sequencing and targeted WGS DO NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA.  \n7) For all other situations not described above, WES DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \n8) Combination testing of WES with intronic variants testing, regulatory variants testing, and/or \nmitochondrial genome testing, sometimes referred to as whole exome plus testing (e.g., Genomic \nUnity ® Exome Plus Analysis), DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA .  \n9) For all other situations  not described above, WGS  DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \nIII.

Scientific Background   \nDNA sequencing is a critical tool for the evaluation of many medical conditions. The two primary \nmethods of DNA sequencing in the clinical setting are Sanger sequencing and next -generation \nsequencing or NGS. NGS is a technique that allows for the rapid seq uencing of multiple strands of DNA. \nIt is not limited to one specific type of test; rather it encompasses numerous technologies that produce \nswift and high -volume sequencing. NGS can be used to sequence larger sequences, such as the exome \nor the entire gen ome. This is opposed to the traditional Sanger sequencing, which is more useful for \nsequencing a specific gene (Hulick, 2024) . \nThe NGS procedure typically includes the following steps: first the patient’s DNA is prepared to serve as \na template, then DNA fragments are isolated (on solid surfaces such as small beads) where sequence \ndata is generated. Then these results are compared against a reference genome. Any DNA sample may \nbe used if the quality and quantity of that sample is sufficient, but the methods of library generation and \ndata analysis often vary from panel to panel. Evaluating the results of a gene panel typically requir es \nexpertise in bioinformatics. Since NGS reports data on any variants found, great care must be taken to \nevaluate these gene variants, especially variants of unknown significance (VUS) and secondary findings \n(Hulick, 2024; Rehm et al., 2013) .  \nExome and genome sequencing are usually performed with NGS. The exome represents all the protein -\nencoding genes, and at least 85% of pathogenic mutations are found in the exome. Further, the exome \nonly comprises approximately 1.5% -2% of the genome, thereby  making it more cost effective to \nsequence than whole genome sequencing. The entire exome includes approximately 30 megabases \ncompared to the genome’s 3.3 gigabases. However, sequencing an entire genome may be useful as a \npathogenic mutation may be in a no ncoding region of the genome, such as gene regulation dysfunction. \nMost clinical NGS testing uses targeted panels or whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) is only used in select cases. For instance, conditions such as nonsyndromic  hearing \nloss (possible pathogenic variants in over 60 genes) may benefit from WES evaluation (Hulick, 2024) .  \nSeveral companies have pivoted towards focused exome sequencing. These are panels tailored to \nindividual phenotypes and target a maximum number of genes depending on the company. There is a \n>30% diagnostic yield, with freedom for clinicians to choose speci fic genes they are interested in, with \nreduced cost and options to reflex to WES for negative cases (GGC, 2022) . In their study, Jia et al. (2023)  \nretrospectively analyzed 372 pediatric patients who were referred to clinically focused exome \nsequencing (CFES), and concluded that CFES may be first -line for “diagnosing young children with \nsuspected genetic conditions, as it validates the identification  of molecular genetics alterations and \nfacilitates comprehensive medical management. The patients that were more likely to receive diagnoses \nvia CFES were those with “metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities, craniofacial /otolaryngology/ \nophthalmologic abnorm alities, and/or [abnormalities of] the integument” (Jia et al., 2023) . Despite the \nnovelty and expected benefits of focused exome sequencing, more clinical studies with larger sample \nsizes are necessary.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 8 of 25 \n \nProprietary Testing  \nMany proprietary technologies for WES and WGS are available. Companies such as Variantyx provide \nhighly specialized genetic testing to patients and clinicians. The Genomic Unity® Exome Plus Analysis test \nsequences the exome, including intronic and regulato ry variants, identifies disease causing deletions or \nduplications in the genome, and analyzes the mitochondrial genome with heteroplasmy (≥5%). This test \nmay identify many genes for a variety of disorders including AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, \nATXN8OS, ATXN10, C9ORF72, CACNA1A, CNBP, CSTB, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, JPH3, NOP56, \nNOTCH2NLC, PABPN1, PPP2R2B, TBP  (for adult -onset movement disorders), AFF2, DIP2B, FMR1  (for \nearly -onset intellectual disability disorders), and PHOX2B, TCF4  (for other disorders) (variantyx, 2020) . \nThis test requires either a blood, saliva or gDNA (genomic DNA) sample and has an eight -week \nturnaround time.  \nClinical Utility and Validity  \nAlfares et al. (2018)  compared the cost -effectiveness and clinical utility of both WES and WGS. Data was \nanalyzed from 108 participants; all 108 individuals had negative array comparative genomic \nhybridization (also known as chromosomal microarray) results and negative or inco nclusive WES results \nbefore WGS was performed. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is another common genetic testing \nmethod that can analyze many pieces of DNA simultaneously. The authors only pinpointed three positive \ncases where WGS identified a genetic or inhe rited disorder that WES did not recognize; further, it was \nnoted that “30% of the positive cases identified by WGS could be identified by reanalyzing the WES raw \ndata, and WGS achieved an only 7% higher detection rate. Therefore, until the cost of WGS appr oximates \nthat of WES, reanalyzing WES raw data is recommended before performing WGS” (Alfares et al., 2018) . \nYang et al. (2014)  conducted a single -center observational study of 2000 patients with clinical whole \nexome sequencing performed for a suspected genetic disorder. A molecular diagnosis was reported for \n504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously  reported. The investigators \nconcluded that “the yield of whole -exome sequencing may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients” (Yang et al., 2014) . Best et al. (2018)  reviewed 31 different \nWES studies and noted that the diagnostic rates varied between 6.2% and 80%; however, the \nresearchers state that the “differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to \nsequencing largely account for the wide r ange of diagnostic rates.”  \nTammimies et al. (2015)  evaluated the molecular diagnostic yield of CMA and WES in children with \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD). The patient cohort included 258 consecutively enrolled unrelated \nchildren with ASD, stratified into three groups based on the presence of major congen ital abnormalities \nand minor physical anomalies. All probands underwent CMA, with WES performed for 95 proband -\nparent trios. The molecular diagnostic yields of CMA and WES were comparable. Among the 95 patients \nundergoing WES, eight  children (8.4%)  received an ASD -related molecular diagnosis. Among the children \nwho underwent both CMA and WES testing, the estimated proportion with an identifiable genetic \netiology was 15.8%. The investigators concluded that “if replicated in additional  populations, these \nfindings may inform appropriate selection of molecular diagnostic testing for children affected by ASD” \n(Tammimies et al., 2015) . A similar study was performed by Arteche -López et al. (2021)  to validate WES \nas a “first -tier test for the genetic diagnosis of [ASD], when there is no suspicion of fragile X syndrome.” \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 9 of 25 \n \nUpon comparing the clinical utility of CMA, FMR1  testing, and WES testing, the researchers “achieved a \nglobal diagnostic rate of 12.8% (44/343), the majority of them being characterised by WES (33/44; 75%) \ncompared to CMA (9/44; 20.4%) or  FMR1  testing (2/44; 4.5%),” evidently demonstrating the “higher \ndiagnostic power” of WES compared to CMA (Arteche -López et al., 2021) . \nTaylor et al. (2015)  performed whole genome sequencing in 217 individuals across a broad spectrum of \ngenetic disorders in whom previous screening had identified no pathogenic variants. Disease -causing \nvariants were identified in 21% of cases, with the proportion increasing to  34% (23/68) for mendelian \ndisorders and 57% (8/14) in family trios. The investigators concluded that the results “demonstrate the \nvalue of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding \nchallenges” (Taylor et al., 2015) . \nMiller et al. (2017)  performed exome/whole genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause in patients \nwith craniosynostosis, in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative. Out of the 40 \npatients’ tests, associated mutations were identified in 15 patients (37.5%) involving 14 different genes. \nIn five of the 15 positive cases, the molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences in \npatient management. The investigators concluded that “the benefits of exome/whole genome \nsequencing to identify causal  mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has \nyielded negative results” (Miller et al., 2017) . \nCrowley et al. (2020)  used WES in a single -center cohort study of 1005 pediatric IBD patients and found \na 3% prevalence of damaging variants in genes linked to monogenic IBD, and that 1% of monogenic \npediatric IBD patients have variants in genes associated with primary immunod eficiency that are \npotentially curable through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As rare genetic variants \ncould manifest in different phenotypes, the researchers believe that the “data supports the diagnosis of \nmonogenic disease beyond th e very early onset IBD population especially in children with a family \nhistory of autoimmune diseases and those with evidence of extra -intestinal manifestations of IBD” and \nthat WES will lend itself to provide definitive and personalized treatments in the future (Crowley et al., \n2020) . \nSrivastava et al. (2014)  conducted a retrospective cohort study on 78 children with neurodevelopmental \ndisabilities and a prior unrevealing workup before WES. The overall presumptive diagnostic testing rate \nwas 41% (32/78 patients). Results of WES affected patient management in a ll cases, most often related \nto reproductive planning (27/78). The investigators concluded that the high diagnostic yield of WES \ncould lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning \n(Srivastava et al., 2014) . \nHaskell et al. (2018)  studied the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in the evaluation of \nneuromuscular disorders. A total of 93 undiagnosed patients with potential neuromuscular disorders \nparticipated in this study; the diagnostic yield of these 93 patients with exome seq uencing was 12.9% \n“with one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in a causative gene associated with \nthe patient's disorder” (Haskell et al., 2018) . In this study, exome sequencing was able to provide or \nclarify a neuromuscular disorder diagnosis, but only in a small percentage of the population studied.  \nInvolving WGS or WES as a supplemental level of evaluation has been able to effect change in medical \ncare and treatment pathways. In the NIH -funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, among 382 patients \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 10 of 25 \n \nwith complete evaluations, “28 (21%) of the patients who received a diagnosis, the diagnosis led to a \nrecommendation regarding a change in therapy. In 49 (37%), the diagnosis led to a change in care other \nthan therapy, such as the narrowing of diagnostic t esting. In 48 (36%), the diagnosis led to variant -\nspecific genetic counseling but did not lead to a change in the diagnostic or therapeutic strategy.” The \nchanges in therapy ranged from known drugs, vitamins, coenzyme supplementations, and transplant in \none patient. This demonstrated evidence supporting usage of DNA sequencing for genetically \ndetermined conditions and a representative lens of how it can affect medical care (Splinter et al., 2018) . \nMuthaffar (2021)  conducted a retrospective chart review for WES results between January 2018 to \nNovember 2019 for patients at a pediatric neurology clinic in Saudi Arabia to identify the utility of WES. \nIt was found that “twenty -six children with undiagnosed neurological conditions were identified and \nunderwent WES diagnosis. Nineteen patients (73.0%) of the cohort were diagnosed with pathogenic \nvariants, likely pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS).” The researcher also \nfurthered the conclusions of  the WES high diagnostic rate by proving direct implications on clinical \nmanagement based on testing results. One patient who had a positive pathogenic BTD mutation, \ndiagnosed at seven -years old with a biotinidase deficiency, was started on biotin supplements after WES \ntesting, and was able to breathe independently off a ventilator, regain motor capabilities with physical \ntherapy, improve hearing, and elimin ate convulsions (Muthaffar, 2021) . \nUsing WES on eleven probands from ten Jordanian families who have been formerly diagnosed with \nlimb -girdle dystrophy (LGMD) and Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT), Ababneh et al. (2021)  identified \na series of missense, nonsense, and deletion variants associated with neuromuscular disorders. \nConsequently, the researchers argue that “Utilization of WES is helpful to facilitate rapid and accurate \nNMDs diagnosis, complementing a thorough cli nical evaluation”, especially in a country where the risk \nof autosomal -recessive disorders is increased by consanguinity and the implementation of genetic \ndiagnosis is limited and the results misunderstood (Ababneh et al., 2021) .  \nSanford et al. (2019)  investigated the clinical utility of rWGS in children within the pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU). They were able to make a molecular diagnosis by rWGS in 17 of 38 children, and in four \nof the 17 children diagnosed by rWGS (24%), “the genetic diagnose s led to a change in management \nwhile in the PICU, including genome -informed changes in pharmacotherapy and transition to palliative \ncare… Eighty -two percent of diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient and/or family \nafter PICU discharge, i ncluding avoidance of biopsy, administration of factor replacement, and \nsurveillance for disorder -related sequelae” (Sanford et al., 2019) . In this retrospective analysis, benefits \nof rWGS were further elucidated in the setting of unknown or unclear clinical etiologies.  \nReda et al. (2020)  studied WES for metastatic solid cancer diagnoses in 506 patients. In this study, the \nsomatic and germline exome analysis was restricted to 317 specific genes. Exome sequencing was \nsuccessful in 386 tumor samples, and 342 patients received a therapeutic p roposal based on their \ngenetic results. However, only 79 patients were treated with an NGS matched therapy. While this study \nshows that WES is a possible tool to assist with metastatic solid cancer diagnoses and treatments, “no \ndifferences were observed be tween PFS [progression -free survival] ratios of patients treated with \nmatched therapy versus standard therapy” (Reda et al., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 11 of 25 \n \nOther studies have also yielded bifurcating results on the periodic revisiting of unsolved exome cases \nand for variants of unknown significance. Salfati et al. (2019)  found that re -analysis of 101 WES cases \none to seven  years after initial analysis resulted in “the identification of additional diagnostic variants in \n3 rare disease cases (5.9%) and 1 sudden unexplained death case (2%), which increased our molecular \ndiagnostic yield to 31.4% and 12%, respectively.” However,  though they recognize the importance of \nany diagnostic yield to those families potentially affected, the authors also acknowledge that “most of \nour cases remain unexplained after our re -analysis”, which they attribute to an enduring lack of coverage \nof functional exonic variants, along with “the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease that is not \neasily dissected in small families, and the possibility of disease due to epigenetic, somatic, or other \nuninterrogated genomic aberrations.” As such, “We [ the authors] suggest that a 6 -month cycle of \nautomated re -analysis could improve the pace at which new findings are disseminated to patients. \nPeriodic re -analysis by third party or other software not originally used to analyze cases is also \npotentially use ful to uncover pathogenic variants that may be missed by the differences across genome \ninterpretation platforms” (Salfati et al., 2019) .  \nParent -child Trio Testing  \nParent -child trio testing is a strategy which helps to identify single pathogenic mutations among the \nmany genomic variants in an individual. Specifically, the sequencing of both the parents and the patient \nallows for the variant to be identified easier an d “filtered based on consistency or inconsistency \naccording to the laws of Mendelian inheritance” (Sakai et al., 2013) . \nLee et al. (2014)  reported on the initial clinical indications for clinical exome sequencing (CES) referrals \nand molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and different test types. CES was performed on \n814 patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions who underwent WES. CES was conducted \nusing a trio -CES technique which involves  both parents and their affected child sequenced \nsimultaneously. Overall, a molecular diagnosis with a causative variant in a well -established clinical gene \nwas provided for 213/ 814 (26%) cases. The trio -CES was associated with a higher molecular diagnostic \nyield (31%; 127/410 cases) than proband -CES or traditional molecular diagnostic methods. The \ninvestigators concluded that “additional studies designed to validate these finding s and to explore the \neffect of this approach on clinical and economic outcomes are warranted” (Lee et al., 2014) . \nSoden et al. (2014)  performed diagnostic WGS and/or WES in parent -child trios for 100 families with 119 \nchildren with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A total of 45% of the families received molecular \ndiagnoses of an established genetic disorder (53/119 affected children) . An accelerated sequencing \nmodality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families with acutely ill children (11/15). In this study, \nWES proved to be less costly than continued conventional diagnostic testing of children with NDD in \nwhom initial testing  failed to yield a diagnosis. The investigators concluded that “initial diagnostic \nevaluation of children with NDD should include trio WGS or WES, with extension of accelerated \nsequencing modalities to high -acuity patients” (Soden et al., 2014) . \nAnother study compared fetal WES versus trio analysis WES on fetuses with sonographic abnormalities. \nThe researchers found that trio analysis yielded a positive/definitive diagnosis in 30% (3/10) of the cases \nas compared to only 14.3% (2/14) of the singlet on cases. They conclude, “In order to expedite \ninterpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 12 of 25 \n \ncompromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes” (Drury et al., 2015) . Similarly, these data are \nsupported by another study of trio analysis of thirty different cases. A total of 10% of the cases were \npositive for a pathogenic finding, and 17% were de novo, inherited recessive, or X -linked variants. The \nauthors conclude, “T his study outlines the way for a substantial improvement in the diagnostic yield of \nprenatal genetic abnormalities through the application of next -generation sequencing” (Carss et al., \n2014) . \nYates et al. (2017)  performed WES, including trio analysis, using samples obtained from deceased fetuses \nwith ultrasound anomalies. They note that 20% of cases were positive overall with a definitive diagnosis \nwith another 45% positive for possible pathogenic candidate varia nts. Comparing trio analysis to \nsingleton analysis, 24% (n=11) of trio analysis resulted in a definitive diagnostic finding versus 14% (n=3) \nfor singleton testing (Yates et al., 2017) .  \nClark et al. (2018)  compared the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and CMA in children with \nsuspected genetic disorders. Trio analyses were also analyzed. Many studies were reviewed in this meta -\nanalysis; the authors state that “In 37 studies, comprising 20,068 chi ldren, diagnostic utility of WGS \n(0.41, 95% CI 0.34 -0.48, I2 = 44%) and WES (0.36, 95% CI 0.33 -0.40, I2 = 83%) were qualitatively greater \nthan CMA (0.10, 95% CI 0.08 -0.12, I2 = 81%) (Clark et al., 2018) . Further, a statistical difference was not \nfound regarding the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS. Finally, “Subgroups with higher WGS/WES \ndiagnostic utility were trios and those receiving hospital -based interpretation. WGS/WES should be \nconsidered a first -line genomic test for children with suspected genetic diseases” (Clark et al., 2018) . \nZhang et al. (2021)  performed WES and trio analysis on 18 unrelated men who have idiopathic \nhypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), which is a rare genetic disorder that causes delayed or absent \npuberty as well as infertility due to gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) insuffi ciency/deficiency, \nand their parents. With this testing, “one reported and 10 novel variants in eight known IHH causative \ngenes ( AXL, CCDC141, CHD7, DMXL2, FGFR1, PNPLA6, POLR3A, and PROKR2 ), nine variants in nine \nrecently reported candidate genes ( DCAF17,  DCC, EGF, IGSF10, NOTCH1, PDE3A, RELN, SLIT2, and \nTRAPPC9 ), and four variants in four novel candidate genes for IHH ( CCDC88C, CDON, GADL1,  and \nSPRED3 ) were identified in 77.8% (14/18) of IHH cases.” This analysis also supported oligogenic etiology \nfor disease presentation, with 44.4% cases carrying at least two variants in IHH -related genes. They also \nfound that the variants “tended to be maternally in herited (maternal with n = 17 vs paternal with n = 7; \nP = 0.028),” which was confirmed by their previous l iterature review, and due to the presence of female \ncarriers, extends the notion that females may be more tolerant of “deleterious” IHH -related gene \nmutations. This study exemplifies the clinical utility of WES and trio analysis for reproductive genetic \ndisorders and could be used to continue pedigree analyses for IHH (Zhang et al., 2021) . \nMalcher et al. (2022)  investigated the use of whole -genome sequencing in identifying new candidate \ngenes for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). The authors applied WGS for 39 patients with NOA to \nidentify novel NOA -associated SNVs, yielding “8 potentially disease causing [sic] variants in 4 genes, \nfollowed by 30 variants in 20 genes that were previously linked to infertility, and 20 variants in 13 genes \nthat have never been investigated with respect to male infertility but could be important in patients \nwith NOA” in 29 of the 3 9 azoospermic individuals. Of these 58 variants, 16 were newly discovered and, \nas such, “highly recommended to examine their possible function and mechanism of participation in \ngametogenesis” (Malcher et al., 2022) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 13 of 25 \n \nIn their examination of whole exome and genome sequencing in a Mendelian disorder cohort, Ewans et \nal. (2022)  determined that “WGS resulted in a diagnosis in one third (34%; 13/38 families) of \nundiagnosed families who had previously had WES.” However, when adjusting for “factors such as \nimprovements to gene -disease knowledge and genomic pipelines through contempo rary WES \nreanalysis, the WGS diagnostic yield reduced to 19% (6/31 remaining families)”, primarily due to “due \nto reduced WES coverage of critical regions that may be solved through an improved WES platform.” \nSuch results contribute to the debate about the  “trade -off between the lower cost of WES and the higher \ndiagnostic yield of WGS” and will ultimately be a function of “the clinical scenario and local resourcing \nand availability” (Ewans et al., 2022) . \nV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)  \nIn 2012, the ACMG released a policy statement outlining points to consider in the clinical application of \ngenomic sequencing to the detection of germ -line mutations. The ACMG recommended that WGS/WES \nshould be considered in the clinical diagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:  \n• “The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but the phenotype \ndoes not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic test targeting a specific gene is \navailable on a clinical basis.”  \n• “A patient presents with a defined genetic disorder that demonstrates a high degree of genetic \nheterogeneity, making WES or WGS analysis of multiple genes simultaneously a more practical \napproach.”  \n• “A patient presents with a likely genetic disorder, but specific genetic tests available for that \nphenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \n• “A fetus with a likely genetic disorder in which specific genetic tests, including targeted \nsequencing tests, available for that phenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \nACMG stated that “WGS/WES may be considered in preconception carrier screening, using a strategy to \nfocus on genetic variants known to be associated with significant phenotypes in homozygous or \nhemizygous progeny.” ACMG further stated that WGS and WES shou ld not be used at this time as an \napproach to prenatal screening or as a first -tier approach for newborn screening (ACMG, 2012) . \nACMG released a guideline on informed consent for genome/exome sequencing. In that guideline, they \nnoted that WGS/WES was not recommended “before the legal age of majority” unless for “phenotype -\ndriven clinical diagnostic uses or circumstances in which ear ly monitoring or interventions are available \nand effective” (ACMG, 2013) . \nIn 2014 the ACMG published guidelines (Alford et al., 2014)  for the clinical evaluation and etiologic \ndiagnosis of hearing loss which state: “Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's \ninformed consent, genetic testing, if available, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis —this testing \nmay include single -gene tests, hearing loss  sequencing  panels,  whole -exome  sequencing(WES),  whole -\ngenome  sequencing  (WGS), chromosome analysis, or microarray -based copy -number analysis, \ndepending on clinical findings.”  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 14 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG published guidelines on the use of fetal exome sequencing (ES) in prenatal diagnoses. \nThese guidelines are  below (Monaghan et al., 2020) : \nPretest Considerations  \n• “Exome sequencing may be considered for a fetus with ultrasound anomalies when standard CMA \nand karyotype analysis have failed to yield a definitive diagnosis. If a specific diagnosis is \nsuspected, molecular testing for the suggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) \nshould be the initial test. At the present time, there are no data supporting the clinical use for ES \nfor other reproductive indications, such as the identification of sonographic markers suggestive \nof aneuploidy or a history of re current unexplained pregnancy loss.  \n• Trio analysis consisting of the proband and both biological parents is preferred to singleton (fetus \nonly) or duo (fetus and one parent) analyses. Trio analysis consistently shows higher diagnostic \nyields compared with nontrio analysis. It allows for the i mmediate identification of de novo \nvariants, determination of phase for biallelic variants, and confirmation of carrier status in both \nparents when a homozygous variant is detected. For laboratories not requiring trio analysis for \nprenatal ES, all efforts should be made to determine inheritance of identified fetal variants with \ntargeted testing of the biological parents. There may be circumstances where both biological \nparents are unable to submit specimens. In this scenario, variant segregation testing usi ng the \navailable parent or testing of other closely related family members should be considered.  \n• Pretest counseling is ideally provided by a genetics  professional during which the types of variants \nthat may be returned in a laboratory report for all tested family members would be reviewed.  \nPosttest Considerations  \n• Post -test counseling is recommended, regardless of the test result. It should be provided by \nindividuals with relevant expertise, preferably a genetics professional.  \nReanalysis Considerations  \n• For patients with initial negative ES results, reanalysis of exome sequencing data aids clinical \ndiagnosis after 12 months. This outcome has been validated in the pediatric population as \nadditional phenotypic findings might be noted during a child’s growth  and development. \nContinuous updates in database resources and new publications may provide further information \nfor variant and gene classification.  \n• Due to the discovery of new gene –disease associations (that were unknown at the time of initial \nanalysis), reanalysis can also be considered for diagnostic results and results deemed to be \npossibly (but not definitively) associated with the fetal phenotype . \n• For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, reanalysis may be considered if a new \nphenotype develops in the proband after birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant \namount of time has passed (either at the discretion of the testing lab oratory or at least 12 months) \nsince the initial testing was performed.  \n• If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time, a reanalysis could be considered” (Monaghan et \nal., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 15 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG conducted a systematic evidence review to support guideline development for the \nuse of exome and genome sequencing among patients with congenital anomalies, developmental delay, \nor intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). From their review, the  ACMG concluded, “There is evidence that \nES/GS for patients with CA/ DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision -making, which could lead \nto improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate \nevidence regar ding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients \nwith CA/DD/ID” (Malinowski et al., 2020) . \nIn 2021 the ACMG asserted that as the body of literature surrounding this continues to burgeon, it urges \nthem to “strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second -tier test (guided by clinical judgment \nand often clinician –patient/family shared decisi on making after CMA or focused testing) for patients \nwith one or more CAs prior to one year of age or for patients with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage” (Manickam et al., 2021) .  \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal and Fetal \nMedicine (SFM)  \nIn 2016 the ACOG and SFM published a joint committee opinion on “ Microarrays and Next -Generation \nSequencing Technology: The Use of Advanced Genetic Diagnostic Tools in Obstetrics and Gynecology”, \nwhich states that “the routine use of whole -genome or whole -exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis \nis not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer reviewed data and \nvalidation studies are published” (ACOG & SFM, 2016) .  \nHowever, ACOG and SFM note that WES may be considered when “specific genetic tests available for a \nphenotype, including targeted sequencing tests, have failed to determine a diagnosis in a fetus with \nmultiple congenital anomalies suggestive of a genetic di sorder.” The guideline further clarifies that “in \nselect circumstances (recurrent or lethal fetal anomalies in which other approaches have been \nnoninformative), [WES] may be considered as a diagnostic tool, but only after other appropriate testing \nhas been  noninformative and after extensive counseling by an [OB -GYN[ or other health care provider \nwith genetics expertise who is familiar with these new technologies and their limitations” (ACOG & SFM, \n2016) . This committee opinion was reaffirmed in 2023.  \nJoint Position Statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD), the Society for \nMaternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF)  \nPer the guideline, the word “sequencing” is used to refer to “whole exome sequencing, targeted analysis \nusing clinical panels, and whole genome sequencing.”  \n“The use of diagnostic sequencing is currently being introduced for evaluation of fetuses for whom \nstandard diagnostic genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), has already been \nperformed and is uninformative or is offered concurrentl y according to accepted practice guidelines, or \nfor whom expert genetic opinion determines that standard genetic testing is less optimal than \nsequencing for the presenting fetal phenotype” (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nRoutine use of prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot be supported due to “insufficient” \nvalidation and data about benefits and pitfalls (ISPD et al., 2018) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 16 of 25 \n \nWithin the section on recommendations for all diagnostic applications of genome -wide sequencing, \nconcerning trio analysis, they state, “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio \nanalysis, where fetal and both parental samples are s equenced and analyzed together. The trio approach \ncurrently benefits timeliness of result interpretation and aids assignment of pathogenicity for detected \nsequence variants. If proband‐only sequencing is performed, validation of diagnostic or potentially \ndiagnostic findings best includes a determination of inheritance through targeted testing of samples \nfrom biological parents” (ISPD et al., 2018) . However, the guideline could not recommend one \nsequencing method over another, nor was the guideline certain on the best way to interpret variants \nfound in genome -wide sequencing.  \nThe guideline provides three scenarios in which fetal sequencing may be “beneficial”:  \n“A current pregnancy with a fetus with a single major anomaly or with multiple organ system anomalies \nthat are suggestive of a possible genetic etiology, but no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA; or in \nselect situations with no CMA result, following a multidisciplinary review and consensus, in which there \nis a fetus with a multiple anomaly ‘pattern’ that strongly suggests a single gene disorder.”  \n“A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with a major \nsingle anomaly or multiple anomalies suggestive of a genetic etiology, and a recurrence of similar \nanomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic  diagnosis after karyotype or CMA. In addition, \nwhen such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected \nproband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it is considered appropriate \nto of fer sequencing for both biological parents to look for shared carrier status for autosomal recessive \nmutations that might explain the fetal phenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a \nprevious abnormal fetus or child for exome sequencing is  preferable.”  \n“In families with a history of recurrent stillbirths of unknown etiology after karyotype and/or CMA, \nwhere the fetus in the current pregnancy has a recurrent pattern of anomalies (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD released an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for \nprenatal diagnosis. Below are the pertinent recommendations:  \n• “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio analysis, where fetal and both \nparental samples are sequenced and analyzed together.”  \n• “Approaches to sequence analysis may vary from examination of genes known to be associated \nwith fetal or neonatal phenotypes to a broader genome -wide strategy. It is also uncertain whether \ninterpretation of variants found by genome -wide sequencing should f ollow the general guidelines \nfor interpretation and reporting of results for children and adults, or whether a more restrictive \napproach, limited to those variants that explain the phenotype is preferable in the prenatal \nsetting, or if a new approach restr icting reporting to severe childhood conditions should be \nconsidered.”  \n• “The current existing data support that prenatal sequencing is beneficial for the following \nindications:  \no A current pregnancy with a fetus having a major single anomaly or multiple organ anomalies:  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 17 of 25 \n \n▪ For which no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA and a clinical genetic expert review \nconsiders the phenotype suggestive of a possible genetic etiology.  \n▪ For which the multiple anomaly “pattern” strongly suggests a single gene disorder with \nno prior genetic testing. As pES is not currently validated to detect all CNVs, CMA should \nbe run before or in parallel with pES in this scenario.  \no A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with \na major single or multiple anomalies:  \n▪ With a recurrence of similar anomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic \ndiagnosis after karyotype or CMA for the current or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \n▪ When such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from \nthe affected proband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it \nis considered appropriate to offer sequencing for both biological parents to lo ok for \nshared carrier status for autosomal recessive mutations that might explain the fetal \nphenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a previous abnormal fetus or \nchild for pES is preferable.  \n• There is currently no evidence that supports routine testing (including upon parental request) on \nfetal tissue obtained from an invasive prenatal procedure (amniocentesis, CVS, cordocentesis, \nother) for indications other than fetal anomalies  \no There may be special settings when prenatal sequencing in the absence of a fetal phenotype \nvisible on prenatal imaging can be considered, such as with a strong family history of a \nrecurrent childhood‐onset severe genetic condition with no prenatal phenotyp e in previous \nchildren for whom no genetic evaluation was done and is not possible. Such scenarios should \nbe reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team preferentially in the context of a research \nprotocol. If sequencing is done for this indication, it mu st be done as trio sequencing, using \nan appropriate analytical approach” (Van den Veyver et al., 2022) . \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Kang et al., 2015)  on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management \nof congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) which state: “In individuals with CMD who either do not have \na mutation identified in one of the commonly associated genes or have a phenotype whose genetic \norigins have n ot been well characterized, physicians might order whole -exome or whole -genome \nsequencing when those technologies become more accessible and affordable for routine clinical use \n(Level C).”  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Narayanaswami et al., 2014)  on the diagnosis and treatment of \nlimb -girdle and distal dystrophies which state: “In patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom \ninitial clinically directed genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic \nconsultation o r perform parallel  sequencing  of targeted exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -\ngenome screening, or next -generation  sequencing  to identify the genetic abnormality (Level C).”  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology (AMP)  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 18 of 25 \n \nThe AMP published a report on the spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing \nprocedures for inherited conditions and cancer. The background of this report states, “Whole genome \nsequencing is currently more expensive than WES, requires gr eater analysis, and generates more \nvariants of uncertain significance. WES is a plausible approach when the clinical picture cannot be \naffirmed using a specific gene panel. As technologies and understanding of variants advance, whole \ngenome sequencing migh t become the test of choice” (Joseph et al., 2016) . \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  \nAAP published guidelines on the evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorder. According to the \nguidelines, CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. Since Fragile \nX Syndrome increases the risk for autism spectrum  disorder, DNA testing for Fragile X should be \nrecommended in all children with ASD, especially for boys and children with a family history of \nintellectual disability. “The cytosine -guanine -guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion that is responsible \nfor fra gile X syndrome is not detected on CMA and must be ordered as a separate test. When the history \nand physical examination, CMA, and fragile X analysis do not identify an etiology, the next step at this \ntime in the etiologic evaluation for [autism spectrum d isorder] is whole -exome sequencing (WES).” AAP \ndoes not recommend the use of commercially marketed tests as they do not provide a molecular \netiologic diagnosis (Hyman et al., 2020) .  \nCanadian College of Medical Geneticists  \nIn 2015, the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists published a position statement on genome -wide \nsequencing for monogenic diseases. Their relevant recommendations include the following:  \n• “Recommendations for diagnostic assessment:  \no Clinical exome sequencing, at this time, should only be used to interrogate the genome for \nnucleotide sequence variants in genes known to cause disease. Clinical WGS may be used to \ndetect CNV and structural variation in addition to sequence variants, thoug h it is not currently \na first -tier test for such analyses.  \no Clinical genome -wide sequencing should be considered in the investigation of an affected \nindividual when his/her phenotype or family history suggests a monogenic aetiology in whom \nthe causal mutation(s) are unknown, and one or more of the following additio nal conditions \napply:  \n▪ the phenotype is associated with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity;  \n▪ specific genetic tests have failed to arrive at a diagnosis and testing of other clinically \nrelevant genes is appropriate;  \n▪ genome -wide sequencing is a more cost -effective approach than available individual gene \nor gene panel testing.”  \n• “Until the benefits of reporting incidental findings are established, we do not endorse the \nintentional clinical analysis of disease -associated genes other than those linked to the primary \nindication.”  \nBelow is a figure of a “decision aid to facilitate the diagnostic evaluation of patients with rare disease of \nsuspected monogenic aetiology” (Boycott et al., 2015) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 19 of 25 \n \n \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians  \nIn 2021, the Royal Austalasian  College of Physicians provided guidelines on pediatric genetic testing in \nthe context of intellectual disability (ID) and global developmental delay (GDD). For childhood \nsyndromes or ID/GDD, the group recommends WES or WGS as tests of choice, since they o ffer “a broad, \nagnostic screen,” but acknowledge that WES is more widely available and cost -effective at the time of \npublication. In terms of ordering singleton or trio testing, the group states that “the latter (trio) approach \nis highly recommended given it simplifies analysis… it is also a more streamlined clinical test as trio \ntesting identifies fewer variants of uncertain significance than singleton testing” (Sachdev et al., 2021) . \nVI.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family .

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

The family history is notable for an older sibling who had significant hearing impairment diagnosed in childhood, which raises concern for a hereditary etiology and supports comprehensive exomic testing.\n\nInsurance Policy Document (source: V2.2023 Concert Genetic Testing- Exome & Genome Sequencing for Dx of Genetic Disorders.pdf)\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023\n \n   \n  1 \n CONCERT GENETIC TESTING: \nEXOME AND GENOME SEQUENCING \nFOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF GENETIC \nDISORDERS \n \nSee Importa\nnt Reminder  at the e\nnd of this policy for important regulatory and legal \ninformation.  \n \nOVERVIEW \nExome sequencing (ES) (also known as ‘whole exome sequencing (WES)’) involves sequencing and often copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the portion of the genome that contains protein-coding \nDNA\n, which are termed exons. Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022).

The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available. They suggest that there should be predicted impact on health outcomes, including immediate impact on medical manag ement based on the \nmolecular results.

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022).

The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Intellectual disability (ID, formerly \nreferred to as mental retardation) is \"a disability characterized by significant limitations \nin both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, \nsocial and practical adaptive skills.\"1 Global developmental delay (GDD) categorizes \nyounger children (typically less than 5 years of age) who have significant delay \n(characterized as performance two standard deviations or more below the mean on \nage-appropriate, standardized, normal-referenced testing) in two or more \ndevelopmental domains, including gross or fine motor, speech and language, cognitive,\nsocial and personal, and activities of daily living.2 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 7 of 17\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Autism                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nIncidence \nASD affects approximately 1/54 children.3 ID affects 1-3% of the population worldwide.2\nThe incidence of GDD is estimated to be comparable to ID.1,4 All three \nneurodevelopmental disorders are more common in males.2,4-7 \nSymptoms \nASD was previously divided into categories that included autistic disorder, Asperger's \ndisorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder- not \notherwise specified (PDD-NOS). With current diagnostic criteria, these categories were\nsubsumed under the diagnosis of ASD.\nSymptom onset is in early childhood (typically before 3 years of age).6,7 ASD is often \naccompanied by intellectual disability, behavioral difficulties, and/or sensory \nabnormalities. \nID and GDD may present in infancy or early childhood. ID is assessed in three \ndomains: intelligence (IQ), adaptive behavior, and systems of supports the individual \nrequires.1 Children with GDD have significant delay in two or more developmental \ndomains. Young children with GDD may later be diagnosed with ID and/or ASD.2,4 \nThere are both syndromic and non-syndromic forms of inherited ASD, ID, and GDD. \nThe constellation of associated findings is highly dependent on the underlying etiology. \nClinical information (e.g. presence of specific congenital malformations, dysmorphic \nfeatures, and other symptoms) may be used in some cases to help narrow down the \nsuspected cause. In these cases, it may be possible to identify a narrow subset of \ngenes that may be responsible for an individual's neurodevelopmental concerns.\nCause \nASD, ID, and GDD can develop secondary to head injury, birth complication, endocrine\ndisorder (e.g., hypothyroidism), toxic exposure (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome), inborn \nerror of metabolism (e.g., phenylketonuria), and central nervous system infection.2,6,7 \nThere are also many known genetic conditions that are associated with an increased \nrisk for ASD, ID, and GDD. A thorough clinical genetics evaluation is estimated to result\nin an identified cause in 30–40% of affected individuals with ASD.6 Chromosome \nmicroarray analysis was previously thought to have the highest diagnostic yield of any \nsingle test for these disorders, with an estimated detection rate of at least 10-20% for \nASD, ID, and GDD (often grouped together as neurodevelopmental disorders, or \nNDDs).4,6,8,9 Whole exome and genome sequencing have more recently been \ndemonstrated to have diagnostic yields of up to 35% for those with NDDs and \npotentially higher for those with other comorbidities such as epilepsy or congenital \nanomalies.9 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Inherited forms of these disorders can show autosomal dominant, autosomal \nrecessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial patterns of inheritance. \nDiagnosis \nASD, ID, and GDD are diagnosed through the evaluation of an individual's \ndevelopment and behaviors by an appropriate specialist (such as neurodevelopmental \npediatrician or developmental-behavioral pediatrician). Medical tests such as hearing \nscreening, vision screening, and neurological evaluations may also be performed.2,5 A \ndiagnosis of ASD and/or ID is often difficult to establish in infants and very young \nchildren, as the standardized methods used for diagnosis are less reliable in children \nunder the age of 5 years; the term \"global developmental delay\" is thus used to \ncategorize these individuals.2 Identifying an underlying genetic etiology for an \nindividual's NDD cannot provide a diagnosis of ASD versus ID versus a specific \nlearning disability.\nManagement \nManagement for ASD includes behavioral interventions such as applied behavioral \nanalysis (ABA) therapy, structured educational interventions, and in some cases, \npharmacotherapy.6,7 NDDs are also managed with therapies and educational \nintervention plans tailored to the individual's needs. In a limited number of cases \n(mostly metabolic disorders), knowing the genetic mutation that is responsible for a \nneurodevelopmental disorder can help to guide management. Identifying a genetic \nsyndrome may also alert the healthcare team to potential comorbidities for which \nevaluation and surveillance may be needed.\nSurvival \nWhile life expectancy in autism may be reported as reduced, this is often secondary to \naccidents such as drowning.3 With the exception of individuals with multiple disabilities \n(such as Down syndrome), the life expectancy of individuals with intellectual disability \nis now similar to that of the general population.10 Comorbid conditions can also affect \nsurvival in these disorders.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nTesting for ASD, ID, and GDD may include known familial mutation analysis, single \ngene sequence analysis, single gene deletion/duplication analysis, or multi-gene \npanels of various sizes. \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis. These assays detect gains and losses too large to be \nidentified through standard sequence analysis, often single or multiple exons or whole \ngenes.\nMulti-Gene Testing Panels \nThe efficiency of NGS has led to an increasing number of large, multi-gene testing \npanels. NGS panels that test several genes at once are particularly well-suited to \nconditions caused by more than one gene or where there is considerable clinical \noverlap between conditions making it difficult to reliably narrow down likely causes. \nAdditionally, tests should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of identifying mutations \nin the genes of interest, contribute to alterations in management for an individual, and/\nor minimize the chance of finding variants of uncertain clinical significance. \nASD, ID and GDD multi-gene panels include a wide variety of genes: from a few to \nhundreds or even thousands. These disorders may also be grouped together in broad \n\"neurodevelopmental\" panels. Multi-gene panels may also include genes believed to \nbe associated with disease (e.g. \"susceptibility\" genes), but with a lower impact on risk \nthan recognized syndromes. Results for such genes are of less clear value because \nthere often are not clear management recommendations for mutation-positive \nindividuals.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Whole exome sequencing and WGS have been proposed  for use in patients presenting\nwith disorders and anomalies not explained by a standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a\nbroad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether whole exome or whole genome sequencing improves the net health outcome in\nindividuals with suspected genetic disorders.\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Policy Description  \n \nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is the strategy of using next -generation technology to sequence the \nentire genome. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) refers to sequencing of the exome, the component of \nthe genome that predominantly encode proteins. Next generation  sequencing (NGS) involves \nsequencing of multiple small fragments of DNA in parallel, producing fast, accurate sequencing results \n(Hulick, 2024).  \n \nThis policy is applicable for undiagnosed rare germline disorders.  \n \nII. Indications and/or Limitations of Coverage  \n \nApplication of coverage criteria is dependent upon an individual’s benefit coverage at the time of the \nrequest.

Scientific Background   \nDNA sequencing is a critical tool for the evaluation of many medical conditions. The two primary \nmethods of DNA sequencing in the clinical setting are Sanger sequencing and next -generation \nsequencing or NGS. NGS is a technique that allows for the rapid seq uencing of multiple strands of DNA. \nIt is not limited to one specific type of test; rather it encompasses numerous technologies that produce \nswift and high -volume sequencing. NGS can be used to sequence larger sequences, such as the exome \nor the entire gen ome. This is opposed to the traditional Sanger sequencing, which is more useful for \nsequencing a specific gene (Hulick, 2024) . \nThe NGS procedure typically includes the following steps: first the patient’s DNA is prepared to serve as \na template, then DNA fragments are isolated (on solid surfaces such as small beads) where sequence \ndata is generated. Then these results are compared against a reference genome. Any DNA sample may \nbe used if the quality and quantity of that sample is sufficient, but the methods of library generation and \ndata analysis often vary from panel to panel. Evaluating the results of a gene panel typically requir es \nexpertise in bioinformatics. Since NGS reports data on any variants found, great care must be taken to \nevaluate these gene variants, especially variants of unknown significance (VUS) and secondary findings \n(Hulick, 2024; Rehm et al., 2013) .  \nExome and genome sequencing are usually performed with NGS. The exome represents all the protein -\nencoding genes, and at least 85% of pathogenic mutations are found in the exome. Further, the exome \nonly comprises approximately 1.5% -2% of the genome, thereby  making it more cost effective to \nsequence than whole genome sequencing. The entire exome includes approximately 30 megabases \ncompared to the genome’s 3.3 gigabases. However, sequencing an entire genome may be useful as a \npathogenic mutation may be in a no ncoding region of the genome, such as gene regulation dysfunction. \nMost clinical NGS testing uses targeted panels or whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) is only used in select cases. For instance, conditions such as nonsyndromic  hearing \nloss (possible pathogenic variants in over 60 genes) may benefit from WES evaluation (Hulick, 2024) .  \nSeveral companies have pivoted towards focused exome sequencing. These are panels tailored to \nindividual phenotypes and target a maximum number of genes depending on the company. There is a \n>30% diagnostic yield, with freedom for clinicians to choose speci fic genes they are interested in, with \nreduced cost and options to reflex to WES for negative cases (GGC, 2022) . In their study, Jia et al. (2023)  \nretrospectively analyzed 372 pediatric patients who were referred to clinically focused exome \nsequencing (CFES), and concluded that CFES may be first -line for “diagnosing young children with \nsuspected genetic conditions, as it validates the identification  of molecular genetics alterations and \nfacilitates comprehensive medical management. The patients that were more likely to receive diagnoses \nvia CFES were those with “metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities, craniofacial /otolaryngology/ \nophthalmologic abnorm alities, and/or [abnormalities of] the integument” (Jia et al., 2023) . Despite the \nnovelty and expected benefits of focused exome sequencing, more clinical studies with larger sample \nsizes are necessary.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 8 of 25 \n \nProprietary Testing  \nMany proprietary technologies for WES and WGS are available. Companies such as Variantyx provide \nhighly specialized genetic testing to patients and clinicians. The Genomic Unity® Exome Plus Analysis test \nsequences the exome, including intronic and regulato ry variants, identifies disease causing deletions or \nduplications in the genome, and analyzes the mitochondrial genome with heteroplasmy (≥5%). This test \nmay identify many genes for a variety of disorders including AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, \nATXN8OS, ATXN10, C9ORF72, CACNA1A, CNBP, CSTB, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, JPH3, NOP56, \nNOTCH2NLC, PABPN1, PPP2R2B, TBP  (for adult -onset movement disorders), AFF2, DIP2B, FMR1  (for \nearly -onset intellectual disability disorders), and PHOX2B, TCF4  (for other disorders) (variantyx, 2020) . \nThis test requires either a blood, saliva or gDNA (genomic DNA) sample and has an eight -week \nturnaround time.  \nClinical Utility and Validity  \nAlfares et al. (2018)  compared the cost -effectiveness and clinical utility of both WES and WGS. Data was \nanalyzed from 108 participants; all 108 individuals had negative array comparative genomic \nhybridization (also known as chromosomal microarray) results and negative or inco nclusive WES results \nbefore WGS was performed. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is another common genetic testing \nmethod that can analyze many pieces of DNA simultaneously. The authors only pinpointed three positive \ncases where WGS identified a genetic or inhe rited disorder that WES did not recognize; further, it was \nnoted that “30% of the positive cases identified by WGS could be identified by reanalyzing the WES raw \ndata, and WGS achieved an only 7% higher detection rate. Therefore, until the cost of WGS appr oximates \nthat of WES, reanalyzing WES raw data is recommended before performing WGS” (Alfares et al., 2018) . \nYang et al. (2014)  conducted a single -center observational study of 2000 patients with clinical whole \nexome sequencing performed for a suspected genetic disorder. A molecular diagnosis was reported for \n504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously  reported. The investigators \nconcluded that “the yield of whole -exome sequencing may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients” (Yang et al., 2014) . Best et al. (2018)  reviewed 31 different \nWES studies and noted that the diagnostic rates varied between 6.2% and 80%; however, the \nresearchers state that the “differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to \nsequencing largely account for the wide r ange of diagnostic rates.”  \nTammimies et al. (2015)  evaluated the molecular diagnostic yield of CMA and WES in children with \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD). The patient cohort included 258 consecutively enrolled unrelated \nchildren with ASD, stratified into three groups based on the presence of major congen ital abnormalities \nand minor physical anomalies. All probands underwent CMA, with WES performed for 95 proband -\nparent trios. The molecular diagnostic yields of CMA and WES were comparable. Among the 95 patients \nundergoing WES, eight  children (8.4%)  received an ASD -related molecular diagnosis. Among the children \nwho underwent both CMA and WES testing, the estimated proportion with an identifiable genetic \netiology was 15.8%. The investigators concluded that “if replicated in additional  populations, these \nfindings may inform appropriate selection of molecular diagnostic testing for children affected by ASD” \n(Tammimies et al., 2015) . A similar study was performed by Arteche -López et al. (2021)  to validate WES \nas a “first -tier test for the genetic diagnosis of [ASD], when there is no suspicion of fragile X syndrome.” \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 9 of 25 \n \nUpon comparing the clinical utility of CMA, FMR1  testing, and WES testing, the researchers “achieved a \nglobal diagnostic rate of 12.8% (44/343), the majority of them being characterised by WES (33/44; 75%) \ncompared to CMA (9/44; 20.4%) or  FMR1  testing (2/44; 4.5%),” evidently demonstrating the “higher \ndiagnostic power” of WES compared to CMA (Arteche -López et al., 2021) . \nTaylor et al. (2015)  performed whole genome sequencing in 217 individuals across a broad spectrum of \ngenetic disorders in whom previous screening had identified no pathogenic variants. Disease -causing \nvariants were identified in 21% of cases, with the proportion increasing to  34% (23/68) for mendelian \ndisorders and 57% (8/14) in family trios. The investigators concluded that the results “demonstrate the \nvalue of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding \nchallenges” (Taylor et al., 2015) . \nMiller et al. (2017)  performed exome/whole genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause in patients \nwith craniosynostosis, in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative. Out of the 40 \npatients’ tests, associated mutations were identified in 15 patients (37.5%) involving 14 different genes. \nIn five of the 15 positive cases, the molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences in \npatient management. The investigators concluded that “the benefits of exome/whole genome \nsequencing to identify causal  mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has \nyielded negative results” (Miller et al., 2017) . \nCrowley et al. (2020)  used WES in a single -center cohort study of 1005 pediatric IBD patients and found \na 3% prevalence of damaging variants in genes linked to monogenic IBD, and that 1% of monogenic \npediatric IBD patients have variants in genes associated with primary immunod eficiency that are \npotentially curable through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As rare genetic variants \ncould manifest in different phenotypes, the researchers believe that the “data supports the diagnosis of \nmonogenic disease beyond th e very early onset IBD population especially in children with a family \nhistory of autoimmune diseases and those with evidence of extra -intestinal manifestations of IBD” and \nthat WES will lend itself to provide definitive and personalized treatments in the future (Crowley et al., \n2020) . \nSrivastava et al. (2014)  conducted a retrospective cohort study on 78 children with neurodevelopmental \ndisabilities and a prior unrevealing workup before WES. The overall presumptive diagnostic testing rate \nwas 41% (32/78 patients). Results of WES affected patient management in a ll cases, most often related \nto reproductive planning (27/78). The investigators concluded that the high diagnostic yield of WES \ncould lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning \n(Srivastava et al., 2014) . \nHaskell et al. (2018)  studied the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in the evaluation of \nneuromuscular disorders. A total of 93 undiagnosed patients with potential neuromuscular disorders \nparticipated in this study; the diagnostic yield of these 93 patients with exome seq uencing was 12.9% \n“with one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in a causative gene associated with \nthe patient's disorder” (Haskell et al., 2018) . In this study, exome sequencing was able to provide or \nclarify a neuromuscular disorder diagnosis, but only in a small percentage of the population studied.  \nInvolving WGS or WES as a supplemental level of evaluation has been able to effect change in medical \ncare and treatment pathways. In the NIH -funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, among 382 patients \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 10 of 25 \n \nwith complete evaluations, “28 (21%) of the patients who received a diagnosis, the diagnosis led to a \nrecommendation regarding a change in therapy. In 49 (37%), the diagnosis led to a change in care other \nthan therapy, such as the narrowing of diagnostic t esting. In 48 (36%), the diagnosis led to variant -\nspecific genetic counseling but did not lead to a change in the diagnostic or therapeutic strategy.” The \nchanges in therapy ranged from known drugs, vitamins, coenzyme supplementations, and transplant in \none patient. This demonstrated evidence supporting usage of DNA sequencing for genetically \ndetermined conditions and a representative lens of how it can affect medical care (Splinter et al., 2018) . \nMuthaffar (2021)  conducted a retrospective chart review for WES results between January 2018 to \nNovember 2019 for patients at a pediatric neurology clinic in Saudi Arabia to identify the utility of WES. \nIt was found that “twenty -six children with undiagnosed neurological conditions were identified and \nunderwent WES diagnosis. Nineteen patients (73.0%) of the cohort were diagnosed with pathogenic \nvariants, likely pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS).” The researcher also \nfurthered the conclusions of  the WES high diagnostic rate by proving direct implications on clinical \nmanagement based on testing results. One patient who had a positive pathogenic BTD mutation, \ndiagnosed at seven -years old with a biotinidase deficiency, was started on biotin supplements after WES \ntesting, and was able to breathe independently off a ventilator, regain motor capabilities with physical \ntherapy, improve hearing, and elimin ate convulsions (Muthaffar, 2021) . \nUsing WES on eleven probands from ten Jordanian families who have been formerly diagnosed with \nlimb -girdle dystrophy (LGMD) and Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT), Ababneh et al. (2021)  identified \na series of missense, nonsense, and deletion variants associated with neuromuscular disorders. \nConsequently, the researchers argue that “Utilization of WES is helpful to facilitate rapid and accurate \nNMDs diagnosis, complementing a thorough cli nical evaluation”, especially in a country where the risk \nof autosomal -recessive disorders is increased by consanguinity and the implementation of genetic \ndiagnosis is limited and the results misunderstood (Ababneh et al., 2021) .  \nSanford et al. (2019)  investigated the clinical utility of rWGS in children within the pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU). They were able to make a molecular diagnosis by rWGS in 17 of 38 children, and in four \nof the 17 children diagnosed by rWGS (24%), “the genetic diagnose s led to a change in management \nwhile in the PICU, including genome -informed changes in pharmacotherapy and transition to palliative \ncare… Eighty -two percent of diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient and/or family \nafter PICU discharge, i ncluding avoidance of biopsy, administration of factor replacement, and \nsurveillance for disorder -related sequelae” (Sanford et al., 2019) . In this retrospective analysis, benefits \nof rWGS were further elucidated in the setting of unknown or unclear clinical etiologies.  \nReda et al. (2020)  studied WES for metastatic solid cancer diagnoses in 506 patients. In this study, the \nsomatic and germline exome analysis was restricted to 317 specific genes. Exome sequencing was \nsuccessful in 386 tumor samples, and 342 patients received a therapeutic p roposal based on their \ngenetic results. However, only 79 patients were treated with an NGS matched therapy. While this study \nshows that WES is a possible tool to assist with metastatic solid cancer diagnoses and treatments, “no \ndifferences were observed be tween PFS [progression -free survival] ratios of patients treated with \nmatched therapy versus standard therapy” (Reda et al., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 11 of 25 \n \nOther studies have also yielded bifurcating results on the periodic revisiting of unsolved exome cases \nand for variants of unknown significance. Salfati et al. (2019)  found that re -analysis of 101 WES cases \none to seven  years after initial analysis resulted in “the identification of additional diagnostic variants in \n3 rare disease cases (5.9%) and 1 sudden unexplained death case (2%), which increased our molecular \ndiagnostic yield to 31.4% and 12%, respectively.” However,  though they recognize the importance of \nany diagnostic yield to those families potentially affected, the authors also acknowledge that “most of \nour cases remain unexplained after our re -analysis”, which they attribute to an enduring lack of coverage \nof functional exonic variants, along with “the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease that is not \neasily dissected in small families, and the possibility of disease due to epigenetic, somatic, or other \nuninterrogated genomic aberrations.” As such, “We [ the authors] suggest that a 6 -month cycle of \nautomated re -analysis could improve the pace at which new findings are disseminated to patients. \nPeriodic re -analysis by third party or other software not originally used to analyze cases is also \npotentially use ful to uncover pathogenic variants that may be missed by the differences across genome \ninterpretation platforms” (Salfati et al., 2019) .  \nParent -child Trio Testing  \nParent -child trio testing is a strategy which helps to identify single pathogenic mutations among the \nmany genomic variants in an individual. Specifically, the sequencing of both the parents and the patient \nallows for the variant to be identified easier an d “filtered based on consistency or inconsistency \naccording to the laws of Mendelian inheritance” (Sakai et al., 2013) . \nLee et al. (2014)  reported on the initial clinical indications for clinical exome sequencing (CES) referrals \nand molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and different test types. CES was performed on \n814 patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions who underwent WES. CES was conducted \nusing a trio -CES technique which involves  both parents and their affected child sequenced \nsimultaneously. Overall, a molecular diagnosis with a causative variant in a well -established clinical gene \nwas provided for 213/ 814 (26%) cases. The trio -CES was associated with a higher molecular diagnostic \nyield (31%; 127/410 cases) than proband -CES or traditional molecular diagnostic methods. The \ninvestigators concluded that “additional studies designed to validate these finding s and to explore the \neffect of this approach on clinical and economic outcomes are warranted” (Lee et al., 2014) . \nSoden et al. (2014)  performed diagnostic WGS and/or WES in parent -child trios for 100 families with 119 \nchildren with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A total of 45% of the families received molecular \ndiagnoses of an established genetic disorder (53/119 affected children) . An accelerated sequencing \nmodality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families with acutely ill children (11/15). In this study, \nWES proved to be less costly than continued conventional diagnostic testing of children with NDD in \nwhom initial testing  failed to yield a diagnosis. The investigators concluded that “initial diagnostic \nevaluation of children with NDD should include trio WGS or WES, with extension of accelerated \nsequencing modalities to high -acuity patients” (Soden et al., 2014) . \nAnother study compared fetal WES versus trio analysis WES on fetuses with sonographic abnormalities. \nThe researchers found that trio analysis yielded a positive/definitive diagnosis in 30% (3/10) of the cases \nas compared to only 14.3% (2/14) of the singlet on cases. They conclude, “In order to expedite \ninterpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 12 of 25 \n \ncompromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes” (Drury et al., 2015) . Similarly, these data are \nsupported by another study of trio analysis of thirty different cases. A total of 10% of the cases were \npositive for a pathogenic finding, and 17% were de novo, inherited recessive, or X -linked variants. The \nauthors conclude, “T his study outlines the way for a substantial improvement in the diagnostic yield of \nprenatal genetic abnormalities through the application of next -generation sequencing” (Carss et al., \n2014) . \nYates et al. (2017)  performed WES, including trio analysis, using samples obtained from deceased fetuses \nwith ultrasound anomalies. They note that 20% of cases were positive overall with a definitive diagnosis \nwith another 45% positive for possible pathogenic candidate varia nts. Comparing trio analysis to \nsingleton analysis, 24% (n=11) of trio analysis resulted in a definitive diagnostic finding versus 14% (n=3) \nfor singleton testing (Yates et al., 2017) .  \nClark et al. (2018)  compared the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and CMA in children with \nsuspected genetic disorders. Trio analyses were also analyzed. Many studies were reviewed in this meta -\nanalysis; the authors state that “In 37 studies, comprising 20,068 chi ldren, diagnostic utility of WGS \n(0.41, 95% CI 0.34 -0.48, I2 = 44%) and WES (0.36, 95% CI 0.33 -0.40, I2 = 83%) were qualitatively greater \nthan CMA (0.10, 95% CI 0.08 -0.12, I2 = 81%) (Clark et al., 2018) . Further, a statistical difference was not \nfound regarding the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS. Finally, “Subgroups with higher WGS/WES \ndiagnostic utility were trios and those receiving hospital -based interpretation. WGS/WES should be \nconsidered a first -line genomic test for children with suspected genetic diseases” (Clark et al., 2018) . \nZhang et al. (2021)  performed WES and trio analysis on 18 unrelated men who have idiopathic \nhypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), which is a rare genetic disorder that causes delayed or absent \npuberty as well as infertility due to gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) insuffi ciency/deficiency, \nand their parents. With this testing, “one reported and 10 novel variants in eight known IHH causative \ngenes ( AXL, CCDC141, CHD7, DMXL2, FGFR1, PNPLA6, POLR3A, and PROKR2 ), nine variants in nine \nrecently reported candidate genes ( DCAF17,  DCC, EGF, IGSF10, NOTCH1, PDE3A, RELN, SLIT2, and \nTRAPPC9 ), and four variants in four novel candidate genes for IHH ( CCDC88C, CDON, GADL1,  and \nSPRED3 ) were identified in 77.8% (14/18) of IHH cases.” This analysis also supported oligogenic etiology \nfor disease presentation, with 44.4% cases carrying at least two variants in IHH -related genes. They also \nfound that the variants “tended to be maternally in herited (maternal with n = 17 vs paternal with n = 7; \nP = 0.028),” which was confirmed by their previous l iterature review, and due to the presence of female \ncarriers, extends the notion that females may be more tolerant of “deleterious” IHH -related gene \nmutations. This study exemplifies the clinical utility of WES and trio analysis for reproductive genetic \ndisorders and could be used to continue pedigree analyses for IHH (Zhang et al., 2021) . \nMalcher et al. (2022)  investigated the use of whole -genome sequencing in identifying new candidate \ngenes for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). The authors applied WGS for 39 patients with NOA to \nidentify novel NOA -associated SNVs, yielding “8 potentially disease causing [sic] variants in 4 genes, \nfollowed by 30 variants in 20 genes that were previously linked to infertility, and 20 variants in 13 genes \nthat have never been investigated with respect to male infertility but could be important in patients \nwith NOA” in 29 of the 3 9 azoospermic individuals. Of these 58 variants, 16 were newly discovered and, \nas such, “highly recommended to examine their possible function and mechanism of participation in \ngametogenesis” (Malcher et al., 2022) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 13 of 25 \n \nIn their examination of whole exome and genome sequencing in a Mendelian disorder cohort, Ewans et \nal. (2022)  determined that “WGS resulted in a diagnosis in one third (34%; 13/38 families) of \nundiagnosed families who had previously had WES.” However, when adjusting for “factors such as \nimprovements to gene -disease knowledge and genomic pipelines through contempo rary WES \nreanalysis, the WGS diagnostic yield reduced to 19% (6/31 remaining families)”, primarily due to “due \nto reduced WES coverage of critical regions that may be solved through an improved WES platform.” \nSuch results contribute to the debate about the  “trade -off between the lower cost of WES and the higher \ndiagnostic yield of WGS” and will ultimately be a function of “the clinical scenario and local resourcing \nand availability” (Ewans et al., 2022) . \nV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)  \nIn 2012, the ACMG released a policy statement outlining points to consider in the clinical application of \ngenomic sequencing to the detection of germ -line mutations. The ACMG recommended that WGS/WES \nshould be considered in the clinical diagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:  \n• “The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but the phenotype \ndoes not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic test targeting a specific gene is \navailable on a clinical basis.”  \n• “A patient presents with a defined genetic disorder that demonstrates a high degree of genetic \nheterogeneity, making WES or WGS analysis of multiple genes simultaneously a more practical \napproach.”  \n• “A patient presents with a likely genetic disorder, but specific genetic tests available for that \nphenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \n• “A fetus with a likely genetic disorder in which specific genetic tests, including targeted \nsequencing tests, available for that phenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \nACMG stated that “WGS/WES may be considered in preconception carrier screening, using a strategy to \nfocus on genetic variants known to be associated with significant phenotypes in homozygous or \nhemizygous progeny.” ACMG further stated that WGS and WES shou ld not be used at this time as an \napproach to prenatal screening or as a first -tier approach for newborn screening (ACMG, 2012) . \nACMG released a guideline on informed consent for genome/exome sequencing. In that guideline, they \nnoted that WGS/WES was not recommended “before the legal age of majority” unless for “phenotype -\ndriven clinical diagnostic uses or circumstances in which ear ly monitoring or interventions are available \nand effective” (ACMG, 2013) . \nIn 2014 the ACMG published guidelines (Alford et al., 2014)  for the clinical evaluation and etiologic \ndiagnosis of hearing loss which state: “Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's \ninformed consent, genetic testing, if available, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis —this testing \nmay include single -gene tests, hearing loss  sequencing  panels,  whole -exome  sequencing(WES),  whole -\ngenome  sequencing  (WGS), chromosome analysis, or microarray -based copy -number analysis, \ndepending on clinical findings.”  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 14 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG published guidelines on the use of fetal exome sequencing (ES) in prenatal diagnoses. \nThese guidelines are  below (Monaghan et al., 2020) : \nPretest Considerations  \n• “Exome sequencing may be considered for a fetus with ultrasound anomalies when standard CMA \nand karyotype analysis have failed to yield a definitive diagnosis. If a specific diagnosis is \nsuspected, molecular testing for the suggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) \nshould be the initial test. At the present time, there are no data supporting the clinical use for ES \nfor other reproductive indications, such as the identification of sonographic markers suggestive \nof aneuploidy or a history of re current unexplained pregnancy loss.  \n• Trio analysis consisting of the proband and both biological parents is preferred to singleton (fetus \nonly) or duo (fetus and one parent) analyses. Trio analysis consistently shows higher diagnostic \nyields compared with nontrio analysis. It allows for the i mmediate identification of de novo \nvariants, determination of phase for biallelic variants, and confirmation of carrier status in both \nparents when a homozygous variant is detected. For laboratories not requiring trio analysis for \nprenatal ES, all efforts should be made to determine inheritance of identified fetal variants with \ntargeted testing of the biological parents. There may be circumstances where both biological \nparents are unable to submit specimens. In this scenario, variant segregation testing usi ng the \navailable parent or testing of other closely related family members should be considered.  \n• Pretest counseling is ideally provided by a genetics  professional during which the types of variants \nthat may be returned in a laboratory report for all tested family members would be reviewed.  \nPosttest Considerations  \n• Post -test counseling is recommended, regardless of the test result. It should be provided by \nindividuals with relevant expertise, preferably a genetics professional.  \nReanalysis Considerations  \n• For patients with initial negative ES results, reanalysis of exome sequencing data aids clinical \ndiagnosis after 12 months. This outcome has been validated in the pediatric population as \nadditional phenotypic findings might be noted during a child’s growth  and development. \nContinuous updates in database resources and new publications may provide further information \nfor variant and gene classification.  \n• Due to the discovery of new gene –disease associations (that were unknown at the time of initial \nanalysis), reanalysis can also be considered for diagnostic results and results deemed to be \npossibly (but not definitively) associated with the fetal phenotype . \n• For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, reanalysis may be considered if a new \nphenotype develops in the proband after birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant \namount of time has passed (either at the discretion of the testing lab oratory or at least 12 months) \nsince the initial testing was performed.  \n• If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time, a reanalysis could be considered” (Monaghan et \nal., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 15 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG conducted a systematic evidence review to support guideline development for the \nuse of exome and genome sequencing among patients with congenital anomalies, developmental delay, \nor intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). From their review, the  ACMG concluded, “There is evidence that \nES/GS for patients with CA/ DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision -making, which could lead \nto improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate \nevidence regar ding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients \nwith CA/DD/ID” (Malinowski et al., 2020) . \nIn 2021 the ACMG asserted that as the body of literature surrounding this continues to burgeon, it urges \nthem to “strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second -tier test (guided by clinical judgment \nand often clinician –patient/family shared decisi on making after CMA or focused testing) for patients \nwith one or more CAs prior to one year of age or for patients with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage” (Manickam et al., 2021) .  \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal and Fetal \nMedicine (SFM)  \nIn 2016 the ACOG and SFM published a joint committee opinion on “ Microarrays and Next -Generation \nSequencing Technology: The Use of Advanced Genetic Diagnostic Tools in Obstetrics and Gynecology”, \nwhich states that “the routine use of whole -genome or whole -exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis \nis not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer reviewed data and \nvalidation studies are published” (ACOG & SFM, 2016) .  \nHowever, ACOG and SFM note that WES may be considered when “specific genetic tests available for a \nphenotype, including targeted sequencing tests, have failed to determine a diagnosis in a fetus with \nmultiple congenital anomalies suggestive of a genetic di sorder.” The guideline further clarifies that “in \nselect circumstances (recurrent or lethal fetal anomalies in which other approaches have been \nnoninformative), [WES] may be considered as a diagnostic tool, but only after other appropriate testing \nhas been  noninformative and after extensive counseling by an [OB -GYN[ or other health care provider \nwith genetics expertise who is familiar with these new technologies and their limitations” (ACOG & SFM, \n2016) . This committee opinion was reaffirmed in 2023.  \nJoint Position Statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD), the Society for \nMaternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF)  \nPer the guideline, the word “sequencing” is used to refer to “whole exome sequencing, targeted analysis \nusing clinical panels, and whole genome sequencing.”  \n“The use of diagnostic sequencing is currently being introduced for evaluation of fetuses for whom \nstandard diagnostic genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), has already been \nperformed and is uninformative or is offered concurrentl y according to accepted practice guidelines, or \nfor whom expert genetic opinion determines that standard genetic testing is less optimal than \nsequencing for the presenting fetal phenotype” (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nRoutine use of prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot be supported due to “insufficient” \nvalidation and data about benefits and pitfalls (ISPD et al., 2018) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 16 of 25 \n \nWithin the section on recommendations for all diagnostic applications of genome -wide sequencing, \nconcerning trio analysis, they state, “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio \nanalysis, where fetal and both parental samples are s equenced and analyzed together. The trio approach \ncurrently benefits timeliness of result interpretation and aids assignment of pathogenicity for detected \nsequence variants. If proband‐only sequencing is performed, validation of diagnostic or potentially \ndiagnostic findings best includes a determination of inheritance through targeted testing of samples \nfrom biological parents” (ISPD et al., 2018) . However, the guideline could not recommend one \nsequencing method over another, nor was the guideline certain on the best way to interpret variants \nfound in genome -wide sequencing.  \nThe guideline provides three scenarios in which fetal sequencing may be “beneficial”:  \n“A current pregnancy with a fetus with a single major anomaly or with multiple organ system anomalies \nthat are suggestive of a possible genetic etiology, but no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA; or in \nselect situations with no CMA result, following a multidisciplinary review and consensus, in which there \nis a fetus with a multiple anomaly ‘pattern’ that strongly suggests a single gene disorder.”  \n“A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with a major \nsingle anomaly or multiple anomalies suggestive of a genetic etiology, and a recurrence of similar \nanomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic  diagnosis after karyotype or CMA. In addition, \nwhen such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected \nproband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it is considered appropriate \nto of fer sequencing for both biological parents to look for shared carrier status for autosomal recessive \nmutations that might explain the fetal phenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a \nprevious abnormal fetus or child for exome sequencing is  preferable.”  \n“In families with a history of recurrent stillbirths of unknown etiology after karyotype and/or CMA, \nwhere the fetus in the current pregnancy has a recurrent pattern of anomalies (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD released an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for \nprenatal diagnosis. Below are the pertinent recommendations:  \n• “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio analysis, where fetal and both \nparental samples are sequenced and analyzed together.”  \n• “Approaches to sequence analysis may vary from examination of genes known to be associated \nwith fetal or neonatal phenotypes to a broader genome -wide strategy. It is also uncertain whether \ninterpretation of variants found by genome -wide sequencing should f ollow the general guidelines \nfor interpretation and reporting of results for children and adults, or whether a more restrictive \napproach, limited to those variants that explain the phenotype is preferable in the prenatal \nsetting, or if a new approach restr icting reporting to severe childhood conditions should be \nconsidered.”  \n• “The current existing data support that prenatal sequencing is beneficial for the following \nindications:  \no A current pregnancy with a fetus having a major single anomaly or multiple organ anomalies:  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 17 of 25 \n \n▪ For which no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA and a clinical genetic expert review \nconsiders the phenotype suggestive of a possible genetic etiology.  \n▪ For which the multiple anomaly “pattern” strongly suggests a single gene disorder with \nno prior genetic testing. As pES is not currently validated to detect all CNVs, CMA should \nbe run before or in parallel with pES in this scenario.  \no A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with \na major single or multiple anomalies:  \n▪ With a recurrence of similar anomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic \ndiagnosis after karyotype or CMA for the current or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \n▪ When such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from \nthe affected proband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it \nis considered appropriate to offer sequencing for both biological parents to lo ok for \nshared carrier status for autosomal recessive mutations that might explain the fetal \nphenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a previous abnormal fetus or \nchild for pES is preferable.  \n• There is currently no evidence that supports routine testing (including upon parental request) on \nfetal tissue obtained from an invasive prenatal procedure (amniocentesis, CVS, cordocentesis, \nother) for indications other than fetal anomalies  \no There may be special settings when prenatal sequencing in the absence of a fetal phenotype \nvisible on prenatal imaging can be considered, such as with a strong family history of a \nrecurrent childhood‐onset severe genetic condition with no prenatal phenotyp e in previous \nchildren for whom no genetic evaluation was done and is not possible. Such scenarios should \nbe reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team preferentially in the context of a research \nprotocol. If sequencing is done for this indication, it mu st be done as trio sequencing, using \nan appropriate analytical approach” (Van den Veyver et al., 2022) . \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Kang et al., 2015)  on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management \nof congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) which state: “In individuals with CMD who either do not have \na mutation identified in one of the commonly associated genes or have a phenotype whose genetic \norigins have n ot been well characterized, physicians might order whole -exome or whole -genome \nsequencing when those technologies become more accessible and affordable for routine clinical use \n(Level C).”  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Narayanaswami et al., 2014)  on the diagnosis and treatment of \nlimb -girdle and distal dystrophies which state: “In patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom \ninitial clinically directed genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic \nconsultation o r perform parallel  sequencing  of targeted exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -\ngenome screening, or next -generation  sequencing  to identify the genetic abnormality (Level C).”  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology (AMP)  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 18 of 25 \n \nThe AMP published a report on the spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing \nprocedures for inherited conditions and cancer. The background of this report states, “Whole genome \nsequencing is currently more expensive than WES, requires gr eater analysis, and generates more \nvariants of uncertain significance. WES is a plausible approach when the clinical picture cannot be \naffirmed using a specific gene panel. As technologies and understanding of variants advance, whole \ngenome sequencing migh t become the test of choice” (Joseph et al., 2016) . \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  \nAAP published guidelines on the evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorder. According to the \nguidelines, CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. Since Fragile \nX Syndrome increases the risk for autism spectrum  disorder, DNA testing for Fragile X should be \nrecommended in all children with ASD, especially for boys and children with a family history of \nintellectual disability. “The cytosine -guanine -guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion that is responsible \nfor fra gile X syndrome is not detected on CMA and must be ordered as a separate test. When the history \nand physical examination, CMA, and fragile X analysis do not identify an etiology, the next step at this \ntime in the etiologic evaluation for [autism spectrum d isorder] is whole -exome sequencing (WES).” AAP \ndoes not recommend the use of commercially marketed tests as they do not provide a molecular \netiologic diagnosis (Hyman et al., 2020) .  \nCanadian College of Medical Geneticists  \nIn 2015, the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists published a position statement on genome -wide \nsequencing for monogenic diseases. Their relevant recommendations include the following:  \n• “Recommendations for diagnostic assessment:  \no Clinical exome sequencing, at this time, should only be used to interrogate the genome for \nnucleotide sequence variants in genes known to cause disease. Clinical WGS may be used to \ndetect CNV and structural variation in addition to sequence variants, thoug h it is not currently \na first -tier test for such analyses.  \no Clinical genome -wide sequencing should be considered in the investigation of an affected \nindividual when his/her phenotype or family history suggests a monogenic aetiology in whom \nthe causal mutation(s) are unknown, and one or more of the following additio nal conditions \napply:  \n▪ the phenotype is associated with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity;  \n▪ specific genetic tests have failed to arrive at a diagnosis and testing of other clinically \nrelevant genes is appropriate;  \n▪ genome -wide sequencing is a more cost -effective approach than available individual gene \nor gene panel testing.”  \n• “Until the benefits of reporting incidental findings are established, we do not endorse the \nintentional clinical analysis of disease -associated genes other than those linked to the primary \nindication.”  \nBelow is a figure of a “decision aid to facilitate the diagnostic evaluation of patients with rare disease of \nsuspected monogenic aetiology” (Boycott et al., 2015) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 19 of 25 \n \n \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians  \nIn 2021, the Royal Austalasian  College of Physicians provided guidelines on pediatric genetic testing in \nthe context of intellectual disability (ID) and global developmental delay (GDD). For childhood \nsyndromes or ID/GDD, the group recommends WES or WGS as tests of choice, since they o ffer “a broad, \nagnostic screen,” but acknowledge that WES is more widely available and cost -effective at the time of \npublication. In terms of ordering singleton or trio testing, the group states that “the latter (trio) approach \nis highly recommended given it simplifies analysis… it is also a more streamlined clinical test as trio \ntesting identifies fewer variants of uncertain significance than singleton testing” (Sachdev et al., 2021) . \nVI.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage.

One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Prospective studies with adequate population numbers for \nvalidation are needed…. Currently, it is ideally done in the setting of a research \nprotocol. Alternatively, sequencing may be performed outside a research setting on \na case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected for which a confirmatory\ngenetic diagnosis can be obtained more quickly and accurately by sequencing. \nSuch cases should be managed after consultation with and under the expert \nguidance of genetic professionals working in multidisciplinary teams with expertise \nin the clinical diagnostic application of sequencing, including interpretation of \ngenomic sequencing results and how they translate to the prenatal setting, as well \nas expertise in prenatal imaging and counseling.”  \n“There is currently limited genotype-phenotype correlation for the genetic disorders \nidentified in the fetal period because ultrasound imaging is frequently limited, and \nthe fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described.”  \nSelected Relevant Publications \nThe clinical utility of prenatal genomic sequencing is currently lacking. Multiple recent \nreviews cite a need for further research to better understand the impact of testing in the\nclinical setting.22-25 Future studies are needed to \"better understand which pregnancies \nbenefit most and how to prioritise cases in a way that maximizes benefit\" and to \n\"determine the extent to which prenatal genomic sequencing results actually alter \nperinatal care.\"25,26 \nPrenatal genomic sequencing aims to improve reproductive decision-making, allow for \nmore informed pregnancy and perinatal management options, and reduce morbidity \nand mortality.24,25 However, there is a paucity of well-designed studies examining the \nuse of prenatal WGS, and routine usage cannot be recommended due to insufficient \ndata and a need to address several complex clinical scenarios that may arise during \nclinical use.23,25,26 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11).

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered. In particular, a patient who had negative germline BRCA1 and 2\ntesting, who is from a family with no pathogenic variants, should be considered for \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results. It is also reasonable to order a multi-gene panel if \nthe family history is incomplete (i.e., a case of adoption, patient is uncertain of exact\ntype of cancer affecting family members, among others) or other cancers are found \nin the family history, as described above.\" \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology and Society of Surgical Oncology \nA 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Society of Surgical \nOncology (SSO) joint guideline for germline testing in individuals with breast cancer \nstated the following:13\n\"All patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer with stage I-III or de novo stage \nIV/metastatic disease who are 65 years or younger at diagnosis should be offered \nBRCA1/2 testing\"\n\"All patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer with stage I-III or de novo stage \nIV/metastatic disease who are older than age 65 should be offered BRCA1/2 testing\nif:\nothey are candidates for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy \nfor early-stage or metastatic disease,\nothey have triple-negative breast cancer,\notheir personal or family history suggests the possibility of a pathogenic variant, \nothey were assigned male sex at birth, \nothey are of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry or are members of a population with an \nincreased prevalence of founder mutations\"\n\"BRCA1/2 testing should be offered to patients with a second primary cancer either \nin the contralateral or ipsilateral breast\"\nAmerican Urological Association and American Society for Radiation Oncology \nA 2022 American Urological Association (AUA) and American Society for Radiation \nOncology (ASTRO) joint guideline for clinically localized prostate cancer stated the \nfollowing:14\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The USPSTF guideline recommended:10\nWhen a woman's personal or family history of cancer is consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family \nhistory of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry \nassociated with breast cancer susceptibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) gene mutations with\nan appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from \nfamilies with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations \nare more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for \nthese specific mutations.\"\nNote  This benefit/harm statement only applies to those jurisdictions that do not have \nMedicare guidance. Based upon the guidelines and evidence provided in the clinical \npolicy, following EviCore's criteria for BRCA analysis will ensure that testing will be \navailable to those members most likely to benefit from a genetic diagnosis.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

The WGS was performed in ‘rapid run’ mode with minimum depth of 90 Gb per \ngenome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold. \nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and, in the NICU or PICU, when the \ntest is ordered but may be discharged before results are delivered. \nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using \nchromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within rWGS if the test is validated for CNV \nanalysis. \nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, include but are not \nlimited to any of the following: \n Choanal atresia \n Coloboma \n Hirschsprung disease \n Meconium ileus \n \nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic \nphenotype include, but are not limited to, any of the following: \n Abnormal newborn screen \n Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis \n Hyperammonemia \n Lactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion \n Refractory or severe hypoglycemia \n \nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include, but not limited to, any of the \nfollowing: \n Significant hypotonia \n Persistent seizures \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 4  \n Infant with high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief resolved unexplained event \n(BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features: \no Recurrent events without respiratory infection \no Recurrent witnessed seizure like events \no Required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \no Significantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate \nor lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other tests that suggest an inborn error \nof metabolism \n Significantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible \nchannelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or structural heart disease \n Family history of: \no Arrhythmia \no BRUE in sibling \no Developmental delay \no Inborn error of metabolism or genetic disease \no Long QT syndrome (LQTS) \no Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- \nor second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant \n \nBRUE \nBrief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) was previously known as apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE). In a practice guideline from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is \ndefined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports \na sudden, brief (usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the \nfollowing: \n Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing \n Altered level of responsiveness \n Cyanosis or pallor \n Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia) \nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting \nan appropriate history and physical examination.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Scientific Background  \nGene  mutations  are referred  to as “germline”  if they  are within gametes  (ova  and sperm) . Therefore,  \nthese  mutations  may  be passed  on from  parent  to offspring.  There  are many  different  types  of germline  \nmutations,  such as single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs),  structural  variations  such  as deletions,  \ninversions,  or translocations,  as well as smaller  chromosomal  abnormalities  such as short  tandem  repeats,  \nor gene  fusions. M utations  may  not necessarily  result  in disease.  \nSNPs  are the most  common  type  of genetic  mutation,  such  as missense  mutations.  These mutations  are \nsingle  base -pair changes  where  one nucleotide  is replaced  with  a different  nucleotide . Millions  of \nindividual  SNPs  have  been  identified  through  genome -wide  association  studies,  with  approximately  4000  \nSNPs  with  potential  association  with  disease . Insertion/deletion  (indel)  polymorphisms  are often  a single  \nnucleotide  but may  be up to four nucleotides.  SNPs  often  lead  to frameshift  mutations,  which  can cause  \npremature  stop  codons  and the failure  of the allele . \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 4 of 10 \nStructural variations  are usually  classified  as larger than  1000 base  pairs. These  include  deletions,  \nduplications,  inversions,  translocations,  or ring chromosome  formation.  Due to the large  number  of bases  \naffected,  these  variations  may  lead  to severe  genetic  abnormalities.  For example,  a major cause  of \nDuchenne  muscular  dystrophy  is the deletion  of large  portions  of exons  (coding  portions  of genes) . The \nmost  common  structural  variation  is the copy  number  variant  (CNV),  which  refers  to differing  amounts  of \nDNA  segments  in different  individuals.  For example,  one person  may  have  three  copies  of a specific  \nsegment  whereas  another  may  only  have  two.  These variations  may  lead  to dysregulation,  gain-of-\nfunction,  or loss-of-function  of the affected  genes.  The sensitive  genes  that require  or produce  precise  \namounts  of a protein  product  tend  to suffer more  from  these  variations. \nGermline  mutations  are unique  in that the risk for certain  conditions , including  many  forms  of cancer , \nmay  be passed  from  parent  to offspring. Testing  for these conditions  will often  involve  testing  entire  \nfamilies  if one member  is found to have  a germline  mutation ; for example,  the National Comprehensive  \nCancer  Network  (NCCN ) guidelines  for hereditary  cancer  recommend  testing  for BRCA 1/2, CDH1,  PALB2,  \nPTEN  and TP53  mutations  if any blood  relative  has a known or likely  pathogenic  variant  in a cancer  \nsusceptibility  gene . Wilson  e t  al. (2020)  estimate  that 21,800 adult  survivors  of childhood  cancer in the \nUnited  States  carry  a pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variant  in one of 156 cancer  predisposition  genes.  \n \nOther  types  of mutations  are unique  to germline  mutations.  Errors  in chromosome  number  (aneuploidy)  \nare typically  caused  by non- disjunctions  in meiosis, causing  either  a monosomic  (one  chromosome)  or a \ntrisomic  (three  chromosomes)  set of chromosomes.  Some  aneuploidies , trisomy  21, or Down  Syndrome , \nbeing  most  notable , are compatible  with  life. Aneuploidies  may  also result  with  sex chromosomes,  \nresulting  in conditions  such as Turner’s  Syndrome  (one  X chromosome)  or Klinefelter’s  Syndrome  (XXY).  \nAny size mutation  may  be pathogenic  and must  be classified  as to how  likely  they  are to cause  disease. \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  (ACMG ) has classified  mutations  in five \ncategories,  which  are as follows:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  uncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and \nbenign.  The “likely  pathogenic”  and “likely  benign”  refer to weaker  evidence  than  their  respective  \npathogenic  and benign categories,  and “uncertain  significance”  refers  to evidence  that does  not meet  \ncriteri a for benignity  or pathogenicity  or has conflicting  evidence  from  both  sides.  Prediction  algorithms  \nhave  been used to interpret  variants  and to predict  whether  a variant  will affect  the gene  function or \nsplicing  of the gene.  These  algorithms  are publicly  available  but have  a tendency  of predicting  harmful \nimpact  of a variant.  The specificity  of these  databases  has been estimated  at 60-80%.  \nDue to t he  enormous  number  of variants,  as well as the rate that variants  are discovered,  comprehensive  \ndatabases  of genetic  variants  have  been published and are easily  available. For example,  the Haplotype  \nReference  Consortium  contains  over  40 million  identified  SNPs . Databases  focusing on cancer -specific  \nvariants,  reference  sequences , and the general  population  are all available  publicly.   \nFor many  years,  single -gene  testing  was the standard  approach  for germline  mutation  testing.  In recent  \nyears,  multigene  panel  testing  (MGPT)  has been introduced and widely  accepted  as the first-tier test.  \nMGPT  increases  the probability  of identifying  pathogenic  mutations  and represents  an affordable  \napplication  of next -generation sequencing  (NGS)  into clinical practice.  However,  the clinical utility  of \nMGPT  is not well established,  especially  in cases  where  more  than  one pathogenic  variant  is identified.  \nThe risk for a specific  malignancy  is complex  and if a gene  panel  discovers  a mutation  incidentally,  \nmanagement  can be difficult.  Many  guidelines  call for radical  procedures  for these  disease  states  and it \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 5 of 10 \nmay  cause  unnecessary  harm  for the patient  concerned  about  predisposition  to the disease.  Additionally,  \na combination  of mutations  may  interact  to alter the profile  of the disease. For instance,  certain  \ncombinations  of mutations  may  be detrimental and increase  the overall  risk of cancer  malignancy,  while  \nother  combinations  may  reduce  overall  risk of malignancy.  In this regard,  identifying  clinically  actionable  \nmutations  may  be unclear  with  MGPT.   \nClinical  Utility  and Validity  \nGenetic  testing  for germline  mutations  “can be conducted  on virtually  any tissue  type, ” although  many  \nlaboratories  prefer blood  samples,  check  swabs  or saliva  samples.  Advancements  in technology  and \navailability  of sequencing,  previously  constrained by limitations  of sequential  single -gene  testing  on \nlimited  patient  samples,  have  led to significant  strides  in the understanding  of the genetic  basis  of \ninherited  and somatic  conditions.   \nVariants  detected  by genetic  testing  include  inherited  germline  variants  and somatic  mutations ; next  \ngeneration  sequencing (NGS)  has allowed  for superior  detection  for these  mutations.  The accuracy  of \nNGS  varies  depending on how  many  genes  are sequenced;  fewer  genes  tend  to result  in higher  accuracy  \nsince  there  will be more  “probe -template  overlap .” Although Sanger  sequencing  remains  the most  \naccurate  at >99.99%  accuracy,  it cannot  sequence  a large  quantity  of genes  in a timely  fashion  and is best  \nused  for sequencing  of a specific  gene.  Pogoda  et al. (2019)  identified  rare variants  in the ATM  gene by \nusing single molecule Molecular Inversion Probes (smMIPSs) , an NGS -based screening method . A total \nof 373 patients with dystonia and six positive controls with previously identified ATM  variants \nparticipated in this study. Results generated by the smMIPs  “produced similar results as routinely used \nNGS -based approaches ” (Pogoda et al., 2019) . This suggests that ATM  screening should be routinely \nused when genetic testing dystonia patients.  Further, smMIPs may be an important technique for the \ngermline screening for all rare neurodegenerative disorders.  \nThe c linical  validity  of a genetic  test depends  primarily  on the expressivity  and penetrance  of a given  \nphenotype.  Penetrance  refers  to the likelihood  of developing  a disease  when the pathogenic  mutation  is \npresent,  and expressivity  refers  to the variations  in the way the disease  is expressed.  For example,  \nvirtually  any mutation  in the APC gene  will cause  symptoms  of familial  adenomatous  polyposis,  thereby  \nincreasing  the clinical  validity  of an APC assessment  while  other  conditions  may  not clinically  manifest  at \nall despite  a mutated  genotype.   \nThe clinical  utility  of a genetic  test generally  relies  on available  treatments  for a condition.  Conditions  \nsuch  as Huntington Disease  that do not have  many  options  for treatment  will have  limited  clinical utility  \ncompared to another  condition  even  though the actual test is highly  valid.  Factors , such  as severity of the \ndisease  and management  options , affect  the clinical  utility  of a genetic  test.   \nLincoln  et al. (2020)  performed  a retrospective study  to investigate the yield  and utility  of germline  \ntesting  on cancer  patients  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing.  The authors  calculated  the prevalence  of \npathogenic  germline  variants  (PVG)  and the potential  actionability  of the PVGs  in 2023  cancer  patients . \n30.5%  (n=617)  of participants  had PVGs . Participants  with  PVGs  spanned  all ages  and cancer  types.  \nTumor  DNA  sequencing missed 8.1%  of PGVs . 11.2%  of missed  PVGs  were  only  detected  after \ndeveloping a second  primary  cancer.  The results  suggest  that missed PVGs  could  have  been  detected  \nearlier and the second  cancer  could  have  been  treated  earlier or prevented.  The authors  concluded  \nthat germline  testing  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing can result  in important  findings  that can impact  \npatient  care.  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 6 of 10 \nVI. Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular \nPathology  (AMP)   \nThe ACMG and AMP released criteria on the types and severity of mutations, which are as follows:  \n• Very strong evidence of pathogenicity : Null variants (nonsense, frameshifts, canonical +/ - 1-2 splice \nsites, initiation codon, exon deletions) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease. The guidelines note to use caution in genes where LOF is not a mechanism, if L OF variants \nare at the 3’ end, if exon skipping occurs, and if multiple transcripts are present.  \n• Strong: Amino acid change to a pathogenic version, de novo mutations, established studies \nsupporting a damaging gene or gene product, or if the prevalence of the variant is increased in affected individuals compared to healthy controls. The guidelines note to be careful of changes \nimpacting splicing and if only the paternity has been confirmed.  \n• Moderate: Located in a mutational hot spot or well- established functional domain (e.g., active site \nof an enzyme) without a benign variation, absent from controls in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium, detected in trans  with pathogenic variants for \na recessive disorder, protein length changes, novel missense changes where a different missense \nchange has been pathogenic before, and a possible de novo mutation.  \n• Supporting: Co -segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively \nknown to cause the disease, missense variant in a gene with low rate of benign missense variation, \nif the mutation has evidence that it is deleterious, or if the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for \ndisease with a single genetic cause.  \nThe guidelines also list criteria for benign gene variants.  \n• Stand- alone evidence of benignity: Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 \nGenomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium  \n• Strong: Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder, observed in healthy adult with full \npenetrance at early age, lack of segregation in affected family members (although pathogenic variants may masquerade as nonsegregated), or well -established studies that show no damaging \neffect on protein production.  \n• Supporting: Missense variant of a gene for which truncating mutations are pathogenic, indels in \nrepetitive region of unknown function, silent variants, variants of unknown significance, or a trans  \nversion of a cis mutation.  \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN)   \nMultiple germline  mutations have been incorporated into the diagnostic workups recommended by the \nNCCN. Furthermore, the NCCN has several guidelines which recommend that gene expression profiling, or multiple gene testing, may be helpful, more efficient and/or cost -effecti ve for selected patients. \nPlease see the individual policies.  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology  (AMP) , American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) , and College \nof American Pathologists ( CAP)  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 7 of 10 \nThe Joint Commission noted that germline variants should focus on the pathogenicity of a given variant \nrather than their impact on clinical care. The guidelines recommend reporting germline variants with known clinical impact , such as BRCA1  or 2. A genetic counseling recommendation should also be \nprovided if a pathogenic germline mutation is found.  \nThe guidelines note that it is critical to identify a somatic vs a germline mutation as the type of mutation \nmay have significant clinical consequences . \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology  (ASCO)   \nThe ASCO published guidelines regarding genetic and genomic testing for cancer susceptibility. These guidelines state that  the “ASCO recognizes that concurrent multigene testing (ie, panel testing) may be \nefficient in circumstances that require evaluation of multiple high -penetrance genes of established \nclinical utility as possible explanations for a patient’s personal or family history of cancer. Depending on the specific genes included on the panel employed, panel testing may also identify mutations in genes associat ed with moderate or low cancer risks and mutations in high -penetrance genes that would not \nhave been evaluated on  the basis of the presenting personal or family history… ASCO affirms that it is \nsufficient for cancer risk assessment to evaluate genes of established clinical utility that are suggested by the patient’s personal and/or family history .” \nASCO released guidelines regarding germline testing for ovarian  cancer. ASCO recommends that “ all \nwomen diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer should be offered germline genetic testing for BRCA1, \nBRCA2 , and other ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, irrespective of their clinical features or family \ncancer history. In addition, “first - or second -degree blood relatives of a patient with ovarian cancer with \na known germline pathogenic cancer susceptibility  gene mutation or variant should be offered \nindividualized genetic risk evaluation, counseling, and genetic testing.” Lastly, “ clinical decisions should \nnot be based on a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).” In this case, the patient’s clinical features and family history should be taken into consideration and should inform clinical decision making.  \nVII.

Scientific Background   \nDNA sequencing is a critical tool for the evaluation of many medical conditions. The two primary \nmethods of DNA sequencing in the clinical setting are Sanger sequencing and next -generation \nsequencing or NGS. NGS is a technique that allows for the rapid seq uencing of multiple strands of DNA. \nIt is not limited to one specific type of test; rather it encompasses numerous technologies that produce \nswift and high -volume sequencing. NGS can be used to sequence larger sequences, such as the exome \nor the entire gen ome. This is opposed to the traditional Sanger sequencing, which is more useful for \nsequencing a specific gene (Hulick, 2024) . \nThe NGS procedure typically includes the following steps: first the patient’s DNA is prepared to serve as \na template, then DNA fragments are isolated (on solid surfaces such as small beads) where sequence \ndata is generated. Then these results are compared against a reference genome. Any DNA sample may \nbe used if the quality and quantity of that sample is sufficient, but the methods of library generation and \ndata analysis often vary from panel to panel. Evaluating the results of a gene panel typically requir es \nexpertise in bioinformatics. Since NGS reports data on any variants found, great care must be taken to \nevaluate these gene variants, especially variants of unknown significance (VUS) and secondary findings \n(Hulick, 2024; Rehm et al., 2013) .  \nExome and genome sequencing are usually performed with NGS. The exome represents all the protein -\nencoding genes, and at least 85% of pathogenic mutations are found in the exome. Further, the exome \nonly comprises approximately 1.5% -2% of the genome, thereby  making it more cost effective to \nsequence than whole genome sequencing. The entire exome includes approximately 30 megabases \ncompared to the genome’s 3.3 gigabases. However, sequencing an entire genome may be useful as a \npathogenic mutation may be in a no ncoding region of the genome, such as gene regulation dysfunction. \nMost clinical NGS testing uses targeted panels or whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) is only used in select cases. For instance, conditions such as nonsyndromic  hearing \nloss (possible pathogenic variants in over 60 genes) may benefit from WES evaluation (Hulick, 2024) .  \nSeveral companies have pivoted towards focused exome sequencing. These are panels tailored to \nindividual phenotypes and target a maximum number of genes depending on the company. There is a \n>30% diagnostic yield, with freedom for clinicians to choose speci fic genes they are interested in, with \nreduced cost and options to reflex to WES for negative cases (GGC, 2022) . In their study, Jia et al. (2023)  \nretrospectively analyzed 372 pediatric patients who were referred to clinically focused exome \nsequencing (CFES), and concluded that CFES may be first -line for “diagnosing young children with \nsuspected genetic conditions, as it validates the identification  of molecular genetics alterations and \nfacilitates comprehensive medical management. The patients that were more likely to receive diagnoses \nvia CFES were those with “metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities, craniofacial /otolaryngology/ \nophthalmologic abnorm alities, and/or [abnormalities of] the integument” (Jia et al., 2023) . Despite the \nnovelty and expected benefits of focused exome sequencing, more clinical studies with larger sample \nsizes are necessary.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 8 of 25 \n \nProprietary Testing  \nMany proprietary technologies for WES and WGS are available. Companies such as Variantyx provide \nhighly specialized genetic testing to patients and clinicians. The Genomic Unity® Exome Plus Analysis test \nsequences the exome, including intronic and regulato ry variants, identifies disease causing deletions or \nduplications in the genome, and analyzes the mitochondrial genome with heteroplasmy (≥5%). This test \nmay identify many genes for a variety of disorders including AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, \nATXN8OS, ATXN10, C9ORF72, CACNA1A, CNBP, CSTB, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, JPH3, NOP56, \nNOTCH2NLC, PABPN1, PPP2R2B, TBP  (for adult -onset movement disorders), AFF2, DIP2B, FMR1  (for \nearly -onset intellectual disability disorders), and PHOX2B, TCF4  (for other disorders) (variantyx, 2020) . \nThis test requires either a blood, saliva or gDNA (genomic DNA) sample and has an eight -week \nturnaround time.  \nClinical Utility and Validity  \nAlfares et al. (2018)  compared the cost -effectiveness and clinical utility of both WES and WGS. Data was \nanalyzed from 108 participants; all 108 individuals had negative array comparative genomic \nhybridization (also known as chromosomal microarray) results and negative or inco nclusive WES results \nbefore WGS was performed. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is another common genetic testing \nmethod that can analyze many pieces of DNA simultaneously. The authors only pinpointed three positive \ncases where WGS identified a genetic or inhe rited disorder that WES did not recognize; further, it was \nnoted that “30% of the positive cases identified by WGS could be identified by reanalyzing the WES raw \ndata, and WGS achieved an only 7% higher detection rate. Therefore, until the cost of WGS appr oximates \nthat of WES, reanalyzing WES raw data is recommended before performing WGS” (Alfares et al., 2018) . \nYang et al. (2014)  conducted a single -center observational study of 2000 patients with clinical whole \nexome sequencing performed for a suspected genetic disorder. A molecular diagnosis was reported for \n504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously  reported. The investigators \nconcluded that “the yield of whole -exome sequencing may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients” (Yang et al., 2014) . Best et al. (2018)  reviewed 31 different \nWES studies and noted that the diagnostic rates varied between 6.2% and 80%; however, the \nresearchers state that the “differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to \nsequencing largely account for the wide r ange of diagnostic rates.”  \nTammimies et al. (2015)  evaluated the molecular diagnostic yield of CMA and WES in children with \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD). The patient cohort included 258 consecutively enrolled unrelated \nchildren with ASD, stratified into three groups based on the presence of major congen ital abnormalities \nand minor physical anomalies. All probands underwent CMA, with WES performed for 95 proband -\nparent trios. The molecular diagnostic yields of CMA and WES were comparable. Among the 95 patients \nundergoing WES, eight  children (8.4%)  received an ASD -related molecular diagnosis. Among the children \nwho underwent both CMA and WES testing, the estimated proportion with an identifiable genetic \netiology was 15.8%. The investigators concluded that “if replicated in additional  populations, these \nfindings may inform appropriate selection of molecular diagnostic testing for children affected by ASD” \n(Tammimies et al., 2015) . A similar study was performed by Arteche -López et al. (2021)  to validate WES \nas a “first -tier test for the genetic diagnosis of [ASD], when there is no suspicion of fragile X syndrome.” \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 9 of 25 \n \nUpon comparing the clinical utility of CMA, FMR1  testing, and WES testing, the researchers “achieved a \nglobal diagnostic rate of 12.8% (44/343), the majority of them being characterised by WES (33/44; 75%) \ncompared to CMA (9/44; 20.4%) or  FMR1  testing (2/44; 4.5%),” evidently demonstrating the “higher \ndiagnostic power” of WES compared to CMA (Arteche -López et al., 2021) . \nTaylor et al. (2015)  performed whole genome sequencing in 217 individuals across a broad spectrum of \ngenetic disorders in whom previous screening had identified no pathogenic variants. Disease -causing \nvariants were identified in 21% of cases, with the proportion increasing to  34% (23/68) for mendelian \ndisorders and 57% (8/14) in family trios. The investigators concluded that the results “demonstrate the \nvalue of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding \nchallenges” (Taylor et al., 2015) . \nMiller et al. (2017)  performed exome/whole genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause in patients \nwith craniosynostosis, in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative. Out of the 40 \npatients’ tests, associated mutations were identified in 15 patients (37.5%) involving 14 different genes. \nIn five of the 15 positive cases, the molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences in \npatient management. The investigators concluded that “the benefits of exome/whole genome \nsequencing to identify causal  mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has \nyielded negative results” (Miller et al., 2017) . \nCrowley et al. (2020)  used WES in a single -center cohort study of 1005 pediatric IBD patients and found \na 3% prevalence of damaging variants in genes linked to monogenic IBD, and that 1% of monogenic \npediatric IBD patients have variants in genes associated with primary immunod eficiency that are \npotentially curable through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As rare genetic variants \ncould manifest in different phenotypes, the researchers believe that the “data supports the diagnosis of \nmonogenic disease beyond th e very early onset IBD population especially in children with a family \nhistory of autoimmune diseases and those with evidence of extra -intestinal manifestations of IBD” and \nthat WES will lend itself to provide definitive and personalized treatments in the future (Crowley et al., \n2020) . \nSrivastava et al. (2014)  conducted a retrospective cohort study on 78 children with neurodevelopmental \ndisabilities and a prior unrevealing workup before WES. The overall presumptive diagnostic testing rate \nwas 41% (32/78 patients). Results of WES affected patient management in a ll cases, most often related \nto reproductive planning (27/78). The investigators concluded that the high diagnostic yield of WES \ncould lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning \n(Srivastava et al., 2014) . \nHaskell et al. (2018)  studied the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in the evaluation of \nneuromuscular disorders. A total of 93 undiagnosed patients with potential neuromuscular disorders \nparticipated in this study; the diagnostic yield of these 93 patients with exome seq uencing was 12.9% \n“with one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in a causative gene associated with \nthe patient's disorder” (Haskell et al., 2018) . In this study, exome sequencing was able to provide or \nclarify a neuromuscular disorder diagnosis, but only in a small percentage of the population studied.  \nInvolving WGS or WES as a supplemental level of evaluation has been able to effect change in medical \ncare and treatment pathways. In the NIH -funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, among 382 patients \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 10 of 25 \n \nwith complete evaluations, “28 (21%) of the patients who received a diagnosis, the diagnosis led to a \nrecommendation regarding a change in therapy. In 49 (37%), the diagnosis led to a change in care other \nthan therapy, such as the narrowing of diagnostic t esting. In 48 (36%), the diagnosis led to variant -\nspecific genetic counseling but did not lead to a change in the diagnostic or therapeutic strategy.” The \nchanges in therapy ranged from known drugs, vitamins, coenzyme supplementations, and transplant in \none patient. This demonstrated evidence supporting usage of DNA sequencing for genetically \ndetermined conditions and a representative lens of how it can affect medical care (Splinter et al., 2018) . \nMuthaffar (2021)  conducted a retrospective chart review for WES results between January 2018 to \nNovember 2019 for patients at a pediatric neurology clinic in Saudi Arabia to identify the utility of WES. \nIt was found that “twenty -six children with undiagnosed neurological conditions were identified and \nunderwent WES diagnosis. Nineteen patients (73.0%) of the cohort were diagnosed with pathogenic \nvariants, likely pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS).” The researcher also \nfurthered the conclusions of  the WES high diagnostic rate by proving direct implications on clinical \nmanagement based on testing results. One patient who had a positive pathogenic BTD mutation, \ndiagnosed at seven -years old with a biotinidase deficiency, was started on biotin supplements after WES \ntesting, and was able to breathe independently off a ventilator, regain motor capabilities with physical \ntherapy, improve hearing, and elimin ate convulsions (Muthaffar, 2021) . \nUsing WES on eleven probands from ten Jordanian families who have been formerly diagnosed with \nlimb -girdle dystrophy (LGMD) and Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT), Ababneh et al. (2021)  identified \na series of missense, nonsense, and deletion variants associated with neuromuscular disorders. \nConsequently, the researchers argue that “Utilization of WES is helpful to facilitate rapid and accurate \nNMDs diagnosis, complementing a thorough cli nical evaluation”, especially in a country where the risk \nof autosomal -recessive disorders is increased by consanguinity and the implementation of genetic \ndiagnosis is limited and the results misunderstood (Ababneh et al., 2021) .  \nSanford et al. (2019)  investigated the clinical utility of rWGS in children within the pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU). They were able to make a molecular diagnosis by rWGS in 17 of 38 children, and in four \nof the 17 children diagnosed by rWGS (24%), “the genetic diagnose s led to a change in management \nwhile in the PICU, including genome -informed changes in pharmacotherapy and transition to palliative \ncare… Eighty -two percent of diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient and/or family \nafter PICU discharge, i ncluding avoidance of biopsy, administration of factor replacement, and \nsurveillance for disorder -related sequelae” (Sanford et al., 2019) . In this retrospective analysis, benefits \nof rWGS were further elucidated in the setting of unknown or unclear clinical etiologies.  \nReda et al. (2020)  studied WES for metastatic solid cancer diagnoses in 506 patients. In this study, the \nsomatic and germline exome analysis was restricted to 317 specific genes. Exome sequencing was \nsuccessful in 386 tumor samples, and 342 patients received a therapeutic p roposal based on their \ngenetic results. However, only 79 patients were treated with an NGS matched therapy. While this study \nshows that WES is a possible tool to assist with metastatic solid cancer diagnoses and treatments, “no \ndifferences were observed be tween PFS [progression -free survival] ratios of patients treated with \nmatched therapy versus standard therapy” (Reda et al., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 11 of 25 \n \nOther studies have also yielded bifurcating results on the periodic revisiting of unsolved exome cases \nand for variants of unknown significance. Salfati et al. (2019)  found that re -analysis of 101 WES cases \none to seven  years after initial analysis resulted in “the identification of additional diagnostic variants in \n3 rare disease cases (5.9%) and 1 sudden unexplained death case (2%), which increased our molecular \ndiagnostic yield to 31.4% and 12%, respectively.” However,  though they recognize the importance of \nany diagnostic yield to those families potentially affected, the authors also acknowledge that “most of \nour cases remain unexplained after our re -analysis”, which they attribute to an enduring lack of coverage \nof functional exonic variants, along with “the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease that is not \neasily dissected in small families, and the possibility of disease due to epigenetic, somatic, or other \nuninterrogated genomic aberrations.” As such, “We [ the authors] suggest that a 6 -month cycle of \nautomated re -analysis could improve the pace at which new findings are disseminated to patients. \nPeriodic re -analysis by third party or other software not originally used to analyze cases is also \npotentially use ful to uncover pathogenic variants that may be missed by the differences across genome \ninterpretation platforms” (Salfati et al., 2019) .  \nParent -child Trio Testing  \nParent -child trio testing is a strategy which helps to identify single pathogenic mutations among the \nmany genomic variants in an individual. Specifically, the sequencing of both the parents and the patient \nallows for the variant to be identified easier an d “filtered based on consistency or inconsistency \naccording to the laws of Mendelian inheritance” (Sakai et al., 2013) . \nLee et al. (2014)  reported on the initial clinical indications for clinical exome sequencing (CES) referrals \nand molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and different test types. CES was performed on \n814 patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions who underwent WES. CES was conducted \nusing a trio -CES technique which involves  both parents and their affected child sequenced \nsimultaneously. Overall, a molecular diagnosis with a causative variant in a well -established clinical gene \nwas provided for 213/ 814 (26%) cases. The trio -CES was associated with a higher molecular diagnostic \nyield (31%; 127/410 cases) than proband -CES or traditional molecular diagnostic methods. The \ninvestigators concluded that “additional studies designed to validate these finding s and to explore the \neffect of this approach on clinical and economic outcomes are warranted” (Lee et al., 2014) . \nSoden et al. (2014)  performed diagnostic WGS and/or WES in parent -child trios for 100 families with 119 \nchildren with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A total of 45% of the families received molecular \ndiagnoses of an established genetic disorder (53/119 affected children) . An accelerated sequencing \nmodality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families with acutely ill children (11/15). In this study, \nWES proved to be less costly than continued conventional diagnostic testing of children with NDD in \nwhom initial testing  failed to yield a diagnosis. The investigators concluded that “initial diagnostic \nevaluation of children with NDD should include trio WGS or WES, with extension of accelerated \nsequencing modalities to high -acuity patients” (Soden et al., 2014) . \nAnother study compared fetal WES versus trio analysis WES on fetuses with sonographic abnormalities. \nThe researchers found that trio analysis yielded a positive/definitive diagnosis in 30% (3/10) of the cases \nas compared to only 14.3% (2/14) of the singlet on cases. They conclude, “In order to expedite \ninterpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 12 of 25 \n \ncompromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes” (Drury et al., 2015) . Similarly, these data are \nsupported by another study of trio analysis of thirty different cases. A total of 10% of the cases were \npositive for a pathogenic finding, and 17% were de novo, inherited recessive, or X -linked variants. The \nauthors conclude, “T his study outlines the way for a substantial improvement in the diagnostic yield of \nprenatal genetic abnormalities through the application of next -generation sequencing” (Carss et al., \n2014) . \nYates et al. (2017)  performed WES, including trio analysis, using samples obtained from deceased fetuses \nwith ultrasound anomalies. They note that 20% of cases were positive overall with a definitive diagnosis \nwith another 45% positive for possible pathogenic candidate varia nts. Comparing trio analysis to \nsingleton analysis, 24% (n=11) of trio analysis resulted in a definitive diagnostic finding versus 14% (n=3) \nfor singleton testing (Yates et al., 2017) .  \nClark et al. (2018)  compared the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and CMA in children with \nsuspected genetic disorders. Trio analyses were also analyzed. Many studies were reviewed in this meta -\nanalysis; the authors state that “In 37 studies, comprising 20,068 chi ldren, diagnostic utility of WGS \n(0.41, 95% CI 0.34 -0.48, I2 = 44%) and WES (0.36, 95% CI 0.33 -0.40, I2 = 83%) were qualitatively greater \nthan CMA (0.10, 95% CI 0.08 -0.12, I2 = 81%) (Clark et al., 2018) . Further, a statistical difference was not \nfound regarding the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS. Finally, “Subgroups with higher WGS/WES \ndiagnostic utility were trios and those receiving hospital -based interpretation. WGS/WES should be \nconsidered a first -line genomic test for children with suspected genetic diseases” (Clark et al., 2018) . \nZhang et al. (2021)  performed WES and trio analysis on 18 unrelated men who have idiopathic \nhypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), which is a rare genetic disorder that causes delayed or absent \npuberty as well as infertility due to gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) insuffi ciency/deficiency, \nand their parents. With this testing, “one reported and 10 novel variants in eight known IHH causative \ngenes ( AXL, CCDC141, CHD7, DMXL2, FGFR1, PNPLA6, POLR3A, and PROKR2 ), nine variants in nine \nrecently reported candidate genes ( DCAF17,  DCC, EGF, IGSF10, NOTCH1, PDE3A, RELN, SLIT2, and \nTRAPPC9 ), and four variants in four novel candidate genes for IHH ( CCDC88C, CDON, GADL1,  and \nSPRED3 ) were identified in 77.8% (14/18) of IHH cases.” This analysis also supported oligogenic etiology \nfor disease presentation, with 44.4% cases carrying at least two variants in IHH -related genes. They also \nfound that the variants “tended to be maternally in herited (maternal with n = 17 vs paternal with n = 7; \nP = 0.028),” which was confirmed by their previous l iterature review, and due to the presence of female \ncarriers, extends the notion that females may be more tolerant of “deleterious” IHH -related gene \nmutations. This study exemplifies the clinical utility of WES and trio analysis for reproductive genetic \ndisorders and could be used to continue pedigree analyses for IHH (Zhang et al., 2021) . \nMalcher et al. (2022)  investigated the use of whole -genome sequencing in identifying new candidate \ngenes for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). The authors applied WGS for 39 patients with NOA to \nidentify novel NOA -associated SNVs, yielding “8 potentially disease causing [sic] variants in 4 genes, \nfollowed by 30 variants in 20 genes that were previously linked to infertility, and 20 variants in 13 genes \nthat have never been investigated with respect to male infertility but could be important in patients \nwith NOA” in 29 of the 3 9 azoospermic individuals. Of these 58 variants, 16 were newly discovered and, \nas such, “highly recommended to examine their possible function and mechanism of participation in \ngametogenesis” (Malcher et al., 2022) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 13 of 25 \n \nIn their examination of whole exome and genome sequencing in a Mendelian disorder cohort, Ewans et \nal. (2022)  determined that “WGS resulted in a diagnosis in one third (34%; 13/38 families) of \nundiagnosed families who had previously had WES.” However, when adjusting for “factors such as \nimprovements to gene -disease knowledge and genomic pipelines through contempo rary WES \nreanalysis, the WGS diagnostic yield reduced to 19% (6/31 remaining families)”, primarily due to “due \nto reduced WES coverage of critical regions that may be solved through an improved WES platform.” \nSuch results contribute to the debate about the  “trade -off between the lower cost of WES and the higher \ndiagnostic yield of WGS” and will ultimately be a function of “the clinical scenario and local resourcing \nand availability” (Ewans et al., 2022) . \nV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)  \nIn 2012, the ACMG released a policy statement outlining points to consider in the clinical application of \ngenomic sequencing to the detection of germ -line mutations. The ACMG recommended that WGS/WES \nshould be considered in the clinical diagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:  \n• “The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but the phenotype \ndoes not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic test targeting a specific gene is \navailable on a clinical basis.”  \n• “A patient presents with a defined genetic disorder that demonstrates a high degree of genetic \nheterogeneity, making WES or WGS analysis of multiple genes simultaneously a more practical \napproach.”  \n• “A patient presents with a likely genetic disorder, but specific genetic tests available for that \nphenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \n• “A fetus with a likely genetic disorder in which specific genetic tests, including targeted \nsequencing tests, available for that phenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \nACMG stated that “WGS/WES may be considered in preconception carrier screening, using a strategy to \nfocus on genetic variants known to be associated with significant phenotypes in homozygous or \nhemizygous progeny.” ACMG further stated that WGS and WES shou ld not be used at this time as an \napproach to prenatal screening or as a first -tier approach for newborn screening (ACMG, 2012) . \nACMG released a guideline on informed consent for genome/exome sequencing. In that guideline, they \nnoted that WGS/WES was not recommended “before the legal age of majority” unless for “phenotype -\ndriven clinical diagnostic uses or circumstances in which ear ly monitoring or interventions are available \nand effective” (ACMG, 2013) . \nIn 2014 the ACMG published guidelines (Alford et al., 2014)  for the clinical evaluation and etiologic \ndiagnosis of hearing loss which state: “Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's \ninformed consent, genetic testing, if available, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis —this testing \nmay include single -gene tests, hearing loss  sequencing  panels,  whole -exome  sequencing(WES),  whole -\ngenome  sequencing  (WGS), chromosome analysis, or microarray -based copy -number analysis, \ndepending on clinical findings.”  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 14 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG published guidelines on the use of fetal exome sequencing (ES) in prenatal diagnoses. \nThese guidelines are  below (Monaghan et al., 2020) : \nPretest Considerations  \n• “Exome sequencing may be considered for a fetus with ultrasound anomalies when standard CMA \nand karyotype analysis have failed to yield a definitive diagnosis. If a specific diagnosis is \nsuspected, molecular testing for the suggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) \nshould be the initial test. At the present time, there are no data supporting the clinical use for ES \nfor other reproductive indications, such as the identification of sonographic markers suggestive \nof aneuploidy or a history of re current unexplained pregnancy loss.  \n• Trio analysis consisting of the proband and both biological parents is preferred to singleton (fetus \nonly) or duo (fetus and one parent) analyses. Trio analysis consistently shows higher diagnostic \nyields compared with nontrio analysis. It allows for the i mmediate identification of de novo \nvariants, determination of phase for biallelic variants, and confirmation of carrier status in both \nparents when a homozygous variant is detected. For laboratories not requiring trio analysis for \nprenatal ES, all efforts should be made to determine inheritance of identified fetal variants with \ntargeted testing of the biological parents. There may be circumstances where both biological \nparents are unable to submit specimens. In this scenario, variant segregation testing usi ng the \navailable parent or testing of other closely related family members should be considered.  \n• Pretest counseling is ideally provided by a genetics  professional during which the types of variants \nthat may be returned in a laboratory report for all tested family members would be reviewed.  \nPosttest Considerations  \n• Post -test counseling is recommended, regardless of the test result. It should be provided by \nindividuals with relevant expertise, preferably a genetics professional.  \nReanalysis Considerations  \n• For patients with initial negative ES results, reanalysis of exome sequencing data aids clinical \ndiagnosis after 12 months. This outcome has been validated in the pediatric population as \nadditional phenotypic findings might be noted during a child’s growth  and development. \nContinuous updates in database resources and new publications may provide further information \nfor variant and gene classification.  \n• Due to the discovery of new gene –disease associations (that were unknown at the time of initial \nanalysis), reanalysis can also be considered for diagnostic results and results deemed to be \npossibly (but not definitively) associated with the fetal phenotype . \n• For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, reanalysis may be considered if a new \nphenotype develops in the proband after birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant \namount of time has passed (either at the discretion of the testing lab oratory or at least 12 months) \nsince the initial testing was performed.  \n• If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time, a reanalysis could be considered” (Monaghan et \nal., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 15 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG conducted a systematic evidence review to support guideline development for the \nuse of exome and genome sequencing among patients with congenital anomalies, developmental delay, \nor intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). From their review, the  ACMG concluded, “There is evidence that \nES/GS for patients with CA/ DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision -making, which could lead \nto improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate \nevidence regar ding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients \nwith CA/DD/ID” (Malinowski et al., 2020) . \nIn 2021 the ACMG asserted that as the body of literature surrounding this continues to burgeon, it urges \nthem to “strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second -tier test (guided by clinical judgment \nand often clinician –patient/family shared decisi on making after CMA or focused testing) for patients \nwith one or more CAs prior to one year of age or for patients with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage” (Manickam et al., 2021) .  \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal and Fetal \nMedicine (SFM)  \nIn 2016 the ACOG and SFM published a joint committee opinion on “ Microarrays and Next -Generation \nSequencing Technology: The Use of Advanced Genetic Diagnostic Tools in Obstetrics and Gynecology”, \nwhich states that “the routine use of whole -genome or whole -exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis \nis not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer reviewed data and \nvalidation studies are published” (ACOG & SFM, 2016) .  \nHowever, ACOG and SFM note that WES may be considered when “specific genetic tests available for a \nphenotype, including targeted sequencing tests, have failed to determine a diagnosis in a fetus with \nmultiple congenital anomalies suggestive of a genetic di sorder.” The guideline further clarifies that “in \nselect circumstances (recurrent or lethal fetal anomalies in which other approaches have been \nnoninformative), [WES] may be considered as a diagnostic tool, but only after other appropriate testing \nhas been  noninformative and after extensive counseling by an [OB -GYN[ or other health care provider \nwith genetics expertise who is familiar with these new technologies and their limitations” (ACOG & SFM, \n2016) . This committee opinion was reaffirmed in 2023.  \nJoint Position Statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD), the Society for \nMaternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF)  \nPer the guideline, the word “sequencing” is used to refer to “whole exome sequencing, targeted analysis \nusing clinical panels, and whole genome sequencing.”  \n“The use of diagnostic sequencing is currently being introduced for evaluation of fetuses for whom \nstandard diagnostic genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), has already been \nperformed and is uninformative or is offered concurrentl y according to accepted practice guidelines, or \nfor whom expert genetic opinion determines that standard genetic testing is less optimal than \nsequencing for the presenting fetal phenotype” (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nRoutine use of prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot be supported due to “insufficient” \nvalidation and data about benefits and pitfalls (ISPD et al., 2018) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 16 of 25 \n \nWithin the section on recommendations for all diagnostic applications of genome -wide sequencing, \nconcerning trio analysis, they state, “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio \nanalysis, where fetal and both parental samples are s equenced and analyzed together. The trio approach \ncurrently benefits timeliness of result interpretation and aids assignment of pathogenicity for detected \nsequence variants. If proband‐only sequencing is performed, validation of diagnostic or potentially \ndiagnostic findings best includes a determination of inheritance through targeted testing of samples \nfrom biological parents” (ISPD et al., 2018) . However, the guideline could not recommend one \nsequencing method over another, nor was the guideline certain on the best way to interpret variants \nfound in genome -wide sequencing.  \nThe guideline provides three scenarios in which fetal sequencing may be “beneficial”:  \n“A current pregnancy with a fetus with a single major anomaly or with multiple organ system anomalies \nthat are suggestive of a possible genetic etiology, but no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA; or in \nselect situations with no CMA result, following a multidisciplinary review and consensus, in which there \nis a fetus with a multiple anomaly ‘pattern’ that strongly suggests a single gene disorder.”  \n“A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with a major \nsingle anomaly or multiple anomalies suggestive of a genetic etiology, and a recurrence of similar \nanomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic  diagnosis after karyotype or CMA. In addition, \nwhen such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected \nproband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it is considered appropriate \nto of fer sequencing for both biological parents to look for shared carrier status for autosomal recessive \nmutations that might explain the fetal phenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a \nprevious abnormal fetus or child for exome sequencing is  preferable.”  \n“In families with a history of recurrent stillbirths of unknown etiology after karyotype and/or CMA, \nwhere the fetus in the current pregnancy has a recurrent pattern of anomalies (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD released an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for \nprenatal diagnosis. Below are the pertinent recommendations:  \n• “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio analysis, where fetal and both \nparental samples are sequenced and analyzed together.”  \n• “Approaches to sequence analysis may vary from examination of genes known to be associated \nwith fetal or neonatal phenotypes to a broader genome -wide strategy. It is also uncertain whether \ninterpretation of variants found by genome -wide sequencing should f ollow the general guidelines \nfor interpretation and reporting of results for children and adults, or whether a more restrictive \napproach, limited to those variants that explain the phenotype is preferable in the prenatal \nsetting, or if a new approach restr icting reporting to severe childhood conditions should be \nconsidered.”  \n• “The current existing data support that prenatal sequencing is beneficial for the following \nindications:  \no A current pregnancy with a fetus having a major single anomaly or multiple organ anomalies:  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 17 of 25 \n \n▪ For which no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA and a clinical genetic expert review \nconsiders the phenotype suggestive of a possible genetic etiology.  \n▪ For which the multiple anomaly “pattern” strongly suggests a single gene disorder with \nno prior genetic testing. As pES is not currently validated to detect all CNVs, CMA should \nbe run before or in parallel with pES in this scenario.  \no A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with \na major single or multiple anomalies:  \n▪ With a recurrence of similar anomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic \ndiagnosis after karyotype or CMA for the current or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \n▪ When such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from \nthe affected proband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it \nis considered appropriate to offer sequencing for both biological parents to lo ok for \nshared carrier status for autosomal recessive mutations that might explain the fetal \nphenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a previous abnormal fetus or \nchild for pES is preferable.  \n• There is currently no evidence that supports routine testing (including upon parental request) on \nfetal tissue obtained from an invasive prenatal procedure (amniocentesis, CVS, cordocentesis, \nother) for indications other than fetal anomalies  \no There may be special settings when prenatal sequencing in the absence of a fetal phenotype \nvisible on prenatal imaging can be considered, such as with a strong family history of a \nrecurrent childhood‐onset severe genetic condition with no prenatal phenotyp e in previous \nchildren for whom no genetic evaluation was done and is not possible. Such scenarios should \nbe reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team preferentially in the context of a research \nprotocol. If sequencing is done for this indication, it mu st be done as trio sequencing, using \nan appropriate analytical approach” (Van den Veyver et al., 2022) . \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Kang et al., 2015)  on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management \nof congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) which state: “In individuals with CMD who either do not have \na mutation identified in one of the commonly associated genes or have a phenotype whose genetic \norigins have n ot been well characterized, physicians might order whole -exome or whole -genome \nsequencing when those technologies become more accessible and affordable for routine clinical use \n(Level C).”  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Narayanaswami et al., 2014)  on the diagnosis and treatment of \nlimb -girdle and distal dystrophies which state: “In patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom \ninitial clinically directed genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic \nconsultation o r perform parallel  sequencing  of targeted exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -\ngenome screening, or next -generation  sequencing  to identify the genetic abnormality (Level C).”  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology (AMP)  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 18 of 25 \n \nThe AMP published a report on the spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing \nprocedures for inherited conditions and cancer. The background of this report states, “Whole genome \nsequencing is currently more expensive than WES, requires gr eater analysis, and generates more \nvariants of uncertain significance. WES is a plausible approach when the clinical picture cannot be \naffirmed using a specific gene panel. As technologies and understanding of variants advance, whole \ngenome sequencing migh t become the test of choice” (Joseph et al., 2016) . \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  \nAAP published guidelines on the evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorder. According to the \nguidelines, CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. Since Fragile \nX Syndrome increases the risk for autism spectrum  disorder, DNA testing for Fragile X should be \nrecommended in all children with ASD, especially for boys and children with a family history of \nintellectual disability. “The cytosine -guanine -guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion that is responsible \nfor fra gile X syndrome is not detected on CMA and must be ordered as a separate test. When the history \nand physical examination, CMA, and fragile X analysis do not identify an etiology, the next step at this \ntime in the etiologic evaluation for [autism spectrum d isorder] is whole -exome sequencing (WES).” AAP \ndoes not recommend the use of commercially marketed tests as they do not provide a molecular \netiologic diagnosis (Hyman et al., 2020) .  \nCanadian College of Medical Geneticists  \nIn 2015, the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists published a position statement on genome -wide \nsequencing for monogenic diseases. Their relevant recommendations include the following:  \n• “Recommendations for diagnostic assessment:  \no Clinical exome sequencing, at this time, should only be used to interrogate the genome for \nnucleotide sequence variants in genes known to cause disease. Clinical WGS may be used to \ndetect CNV and structural variation in addition to sequence variants, thoug h it is not currently \na first -tier test for such analyses.  \no Clinical genome -wide sequencing should be considered in the investigation of an affected \nindividual when his/her phenotype or family history suggests a monogenic aetiology in whom \nthe causal mutation(s) are unknown, and one or more of the following additio nal conditions \napply:  \n▪ the phenotype is associated with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity;  \n▪ specific genetic tests have failed to arrive at a diagnosis and testing of other clinically \nrelevant genes is appropriate;  \n▪ genome -wide sequencing is a more cost -effective approach than available individual gene \nor gene panel testing.”  \n• “Until the benefits of reporting incidental findings are established, we do not endorse the \nintentional clinical analysis of disease -associated genes other than those linked to the primary \nindication.”  \nBelow is a figure of a “decision aid to facilitate the diagnostic evaluation of patients with rare disease of \nsuspected monogenic aetiology” (Boycott et al., 2015) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 19 of 25 \n \n \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians  \nIn 2021, the Royal Austalasian  College of Physicians provided guidelines on pediatric genetic testing in \nthe context of intellectual disability (ID) and global developmental delay (GDD). For childhood \nsyndromes or ID/GDD, the group recommends WES or WGS as tests of choice, since they o ffer “a broad, \nagnostic screen,” but acknowledge that WES is more widely available and cost -effective at the time of \npublication. In terms of ordering singleton or trio testing, the group states that “the latter (trio) approach \nis highly recommended given it simplifies analysis… it is also a more streamlined clinical test as trio \ntesting identifies fewer variants of uncertain significance than singleton testing” (Sachdev et al., 2021) . \nVI.

A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

Policy Description  \n \nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is the strategy of using next -generation technology to sequence the \nentire genome. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) refers to sequencing of the exome, the component of \nthe genome that predominantly encode proteins. Next generation  sequencing (NGS) involves \nsequencing of multiple small fragments of DNA in parallel, producing fast, accurate sequencing results \n(Hulick, 2024).  \n \nThis policy is applicable for undiagnosed rare germline disorders.  \n \nII. Indications and/or Limitations of Coverage  \n \nApplication of coverage criteria is dependent upon an individual’s benefit coverage at the time of the \nrequest. Specifications pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid can be found in the “Applicable State and \nFederal Regulations” section of this policy documen t. \n \n1) For the evaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder in individuals less \nthan 18 years of age , whole exome sequencing (WES) and comparator analysis (e.g., \nparents/siblings) WES MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA when all of the following criteria are met:  \n \na) When the individual has been evaluated by an ABMGG  board -certified medical geneticist or an \nABGC board -certified genetic counselor (CGC)  and has been counseled about the potential risks \nof genetic testing;  \nb) When the WES results will impact patient management and clinical outcome for the individual \nbeing tested;  \nc) When a genomic  etiology is the most likely explanation for the phenotype;  \nd) When no other causative circumstances (e.g., environmental exposures, injury, infection) can \nexplain the symptoms;  \ne) When the clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single -gene or \ntargeted panel testing (e.g., comparative genomic hybridization/chromosomal microarray \nanalysis) is available;  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 2 of 25 \n \nf) When the differential diagnosis list and/or phenotype warrant testing of multiple genes and \none of the following:  \n \ni) WES is more practical than the separate single gene tests or panels that would be \nrecommended based on the differential diagnosis.  \nii) WES results may preclude the need for multiple and/or invasive procedures, follow -up, or \nscreening that would be recommended in the absence of testing.  \n \n2) For a fetus with ultrasound anomalies, WES and comparator analysis (e.g., parents/siblings) WES \nMEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA  when all of the following criteria are met:  \n \na) When pre -test counseling has been provided by an ABMGG  board -certified medical geneticist \nor an ABGC board -certified genetic counselor (CGC) ; \nb) When standard chromosomal microarray testing (CMA) and karyotype analysis have failed to \nyield a definitive diagnosis;  \nc) When a genomic  etiology is the most likely explanation for the phenotype;  \nd) When no other causative circumstances (e.g., environmental exposures, injury, infection) can \nexplain the symptoms;  \ne) When clinical presentation does not fit a well -described syndrome for which single -gene or \ntargeted panel testing is available. If a specific diagnosis is suspected, molecular testing for the \nsuggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) should be the initial test.  \n \n3) Reanalysis of exome sequencing (ES) data with WES and comparator analysis (e.g., parents/siblings) \nWES MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA  for any of the following situations : \n \na) For individuals less than 18 years of age  with initial negative ES results as an aid in clinical \ndiagnosis when additional phenotypic findings are noted during a child’s growth and \ndevelopment.  \nb) For diagnostic results and results deemed to be possibly (but not definitively) associated with \nthe fetal phenotype (new gene -disease associations might have been unknown at the time of \ninitial diagnosis).  \nc) For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, if a new phenotype develops in the proband \nafter birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant amount of time has passed (at least \n12 months) since the initial testing was performed.  \nd) If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time . \n \n4) When WES is unable to identify a causative mutation and the clinical suspicion of a genomic etiology \nremains in situations where any of the above criteria are met in their entirety, whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA.  \n \nThe following does not meet coverage criteria due to a lack of available published scientific literature \nconfirming that the test(s) is/are required and beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment of an \nindividual’s illness.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 3 of 25 \n \n \n5) If WES has been previously performed, further genetic tests involving only exome analyses DO NOT \nMEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \n6) Focused exome sequencing and targeted WGS DO NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA.  \n7) For all other situations not described above, WES DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \n8) Combination testing of WES with intronic variants testing, regulatory variants testing, and/or \nmitochondrial genome testing, sometimes referred to as whole exome plus testing (e.g., Genomic \nUnity ® Exome Plus Analysis), DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA .  \n9) For all other situations  not described above, WGS  DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE CRITERIA . \nIII.

Scientific Background   \nDNA sequencing is a critical tool for the evaluation of many medical conditions. The two primary \nmethods of DNA sequencing in the clinical setting are Sanger sequencing and next -generation \nsequencing or NGS. NGS is a technique that allows for the rapid seq uencing of multiple strands of DNA. \nIt is not limited to one specific type of test; rather it encompasses numerous technologies that produce \nswift and high -volume sequencing. NGS can be used to sequence larger sequences, such as the exome \nor the entire gen ome. This is opposed to the traditional Sanger sequencing, which is more useful for \nsequencing a specific gene (Hulick, 2024) . \nThe NGS procedure typically includes the following steps: first the patient’s DNA is prepared to serve as \na template, then DNA fragments are isolated (on solid surfaces such as small beads) where sequence \ndata is generated. Then these results are compared against a reference genome. Any DNA sample may \nbe used if the quality and quantity of that sample is sufficient, but the methods of library generation and \ndata analysis often vary from panel to panel. Evaluating the results of a gene panel typically requir es \nexpertise in bioinformatics. Since NGS reports data on any variants found, great care must be taken to \nevaluate these gene variants, especially variants of unknown significance (VUS) and secondary findings \n(Hulick, 2024; Rehm et al., 2013) .  \nExome and genome sequencing are usually performed with NGS. The exome represents all the protein -\nencoding genes, and at least 85% of pathogenic mutations are found in the exome. Further, the exome \nonly comprises approximately 1.5% -2% of the genome, thereby  making it more cost effective to \nsequence than whole genome sequencing. The entire exome includes approximately 30 megabases \ncompared to the genome’s 3.3 gigabases. However, sequencing an entire genome may be useful as a \npathogenic mutation may be in a no ncoding region of the genome, such as gene regulation dysfunction. \nMost clinical NGS testing uses targeted panels or whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) is only used in select cases. For instance, conditions such as nonsyndromic  hearing \nloss (possible pathogenic variants in over 60 genes) may benefit from WES evaluation (Hulick, 2024) .  \nSeveral companies have pivoted towards focused exome sequencing. These are panels tailored to \nindividual phenotypes and target a maximum number of genes depending on the company. There is a \n>30% diagnostic yield, with freedom for clinicians to choose speci fic genes they are interested in, with \nreduced cost and options to reflex to WES for negative cases (GGC, 2022) . In their study, Jia et al. (2023)  \nretrospectively analyzed 372 pediatric patients who were referred to clinically focused exome \nsequencing (CFES), and concluded that CFES may be first -line for “diagnosing young children with \nsuspected genetic conditions, as it validates the identification  of molecular genetics alterations and \nfacilitates comprehensive medical management. The patients that were more likely to receive diagnoses \nvia CFES were those with “metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities, craniofacial /otolaryngology/ \nophthalmologic abnorm alities, and/or [abnormalities of] the integument” (Jia et al., 2023) . Despite the \nnovelty and expected benefits of focused exome sequencing, more clinical studies with larger sample \nsizes are necessary.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 8 of 25 \n \nProprietary Testing  \nMany proprietary technologies for WES and WGS are available. Companies such as Variantyx provide \nhighly specialized genetic testing to patients and clinicians. The Genomic Unity® Exome Plus Analysis test \nsequences the exome, including intronic and regulato ry variants, identifies disease causing deletions or \nduplications in the genome, and analyzes the mitochondrial genome with heteroplasmy (≥5%). This test \nmay identify many genes for a variety of disorders including AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, \nATXN8OS, ATXN10, C9ORF72, CACNA1A, CNBP, CSTB, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, JPH3, NOP56, \nNOTCH2NLC, PABPN1, PPP2R2B, TBP  (for adult -onset movement disorders), AFF2, DIP2B, FMR1  (for \nearly -onset intellectual disability disorders), and PHOX2B, TCF4  (for other disorders) (variantyx, 2020) . \nThis test requires either a blood, saliva or gDNA (genomic DNA) sample and has an eight -week \nturnaround time.  \nClinical Utility and Validity  \nAlfares et al. (2018)  compared the cost -effectiveness and clinical utility of both WES and WGS. Data was \nanalyzed from 108 participants; all 108 individuals had negative array comparative genomic \nhybridization (also known as chromosomal microarray) results and negative or inco nclusive WES results \nbefore WGS was performed. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is another common genetic testing \nmethod that can analyze many pieces of DNA simultaneously. The authors only pinpointed three positive \ncases where WGS identified a genetic or inhe rited disorder that WES did not recognize; further, it was \nnoted that “30% of the positive cases identified by WGS could be identified by reanalyzing the WES raw \ndata, and WGS achieved an only 7% higher detection rate. Therefore, until the cost of WGS appr oximates \nthat of WES, reanalyzing WES raw data is recommended before performing WGS” (Alfares et al., 2018) . \nYang et al. (2014)  conducted a single -center observational study of 2000 patients with clinical whole \nexome sequencing performed for a suspected genetic disorder. A molecular diagnosis was reported for \n504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously  reported. The investigators \nconcluded that “the yield of whole -exome sequencing may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients” (Yang et al., 2014) . Best et al. (2018)  reviewed 31 different \nWES studies and noted that the diagnostic rates varied between 6.2% and 80%; however, the \nresearchers state that the “differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to \nsequencing largely account for the wide r ange of diagnostic rates.”  \nTammimies et al. (2015)  evaluated the molecular diagnostic yield of CMA and WES in children with \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD). The patient cohort included 258 consecutively enrolled unrelated \nchildren with ASD, stratified into three groups based on the presence of major congen ital abnormalities \nand minor physical anomalies. All probands underwent CMA, with WES performed for 95 proband -\nparent trios. The molecular diagnostic yields of CMA and WES were comparable. Among the 95 patients \nundergoing WES, eight  children (8.4%)  received an ASD -related molecular diagnosis. Among the children \nwho underwent both CMA and WES testing, the estimated proportion with an identifiable genetic \netiology was 15.8%. The investigators concluded that “if replicated in additional  populations, these \nfindings may inform appropriate selection of molecular diagnostic testing for children affected by ASD” \n(Tammimies et al., 2015) . A similar study was performed by Arteche -López et al. (2021)  to validate WES \nas a “first -tier test for the genetic diagnosis of [ASD], when there is no suspicion of fragile X syndrome.” \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 9 of 25 \n \nUpon comparing the clinical utility of CMA, FMR1  testing, and WES testing, the researchers “achieved a \nglobal diagnostic rate of 12.8% (44/343), the majority of them being characterised by WES (33/44; 75%) \ncompared to CMA (9/44; 20.4%) or  FMR1  testing (2/44; 4.5%),” evidently demonstrating the “higher \ndiagnostic power” of WES compared to CMA (Arteche -López et al., 2021) . \nTaylor et al. (2015)  performed whole genome sequencing in 217 individuals across a broad spectrum of \ngenetic disorders in whom previous screening had identified no pathogenic variants. Disease -causing \nvariants were identified in 21% of cases, with the proportion increasing to  34% (23/68) for mendelian \ndisorders and 57% (8/14) in family trios. The investigators concluded that the results “demonstrate the \nvalue of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding \nchallenges” (Taylor et al., 2015) . \nMiller et al. (2017)  performed exome/whole genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause in patients \nwith craniosynostosis, in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative. Out of the 40 \npatients’ tests, associated mutations were identified in 15 patients (37.5%) involving 14 different genes. \nIn five of the 15 positive cases, the molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences in \npatient management. The investigators concluded that “the benefits of exome/whole genome \nsequencing to identify causal  mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has \nyielded negative results” (Miller et al., 2017) . \nCrowley et al. (2020)  used WES in a single -center cohort study of 1005 pediatric IBD patients and found \na 3% prevalence of damaging variants in genes linked to monogenic IBD, and that 1% of monogenic \npediatric IBD patients have variants in genes associated with primary immunod eficiency that are \npotentially curable through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As rare genetic variants \ncould manifest in different phenotypes, the researchers believe that the “data supports the diagnosis of \nmonogenic disease beyond th e very early onset IBD population especially in children with a family \nhistory of autoimmune diseases and those with evidence of extra -intestinal manifestations of IBD” and \nthat WES will lend itself to provide definitive and personalized treatments in the future (Crowley et al., \n2020) . \nSrivastava et al. (2014)  conducted a retrospective cohort study on 78 children with neurodevelopmental \ndisabilities and a prior unrevealing workup before WES. The overall presumptive diagnostic testing rate \nwas 41% (32/78 patients). Results of WES affected patient management in a ll cases, most often related \nto reproductive planning (27/78). The investigators concluded that the high diagnostic yield of WES \ncould lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning \n(Srivastava et al., 2014) . \nHaskell et al. (2018)  studied the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in the evaluation of \nneuromuscular disorders. A total of 93 undiagnosed patients with potential neuromuscular disorders \nparticipated in this study; the diagnostic yield of these 93 patients with exome seq uencing was 12.9% \n“with one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in a causative gene associated with \nthe patient's disorder” (Haskell et al., 2018) . In this study, exome sequencing was able to provide or \nclarify a neuromuscular disorder diagnosis, but only in a small percentage of the population studied.  \nInvolving WGS or WES as a supplemental level of evaluation has been able to effect change in medical \ncare and treatment pathways. In the NIH -funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, among 382 patients \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 10 of 25 \n \nwith complete evaluations, “28 (21%) of the patients who received a diagnosis, the diagnosis led to a \nrecommendation regarding a change in therapy. In 49 (37%), the diagnosis led to a change in care other \nthan therapy, such as the narrowing of diagnostic t esting. In 48 (36%), the diagnosis led to variant -\nspecific genetic counseling but did not lead to a change in the diagnostic or therapeutic strategy.” The \nchanges in therapy ranged from known drugs, vitamins, coenzyme supplementations, and transplant in \none patient. This demonstrated evidence supporting usage of DNA sequencing for genetically \ndetermined conditions and a representative lens of how it can affect medical care (Splinter et al., 2018) . \nMuthaffar (2021)  conducted a retrospective chart review for WES results between January 2018 to \nNovember 2019 for patients at a pediatric neurology clinic in Saudi Arabia to identify the utility of WES. \nIt was found that “twenty -six children with undiagnosed neurological conditions were identified and \nunderwent WES diagnosis. Nineteen patients (73.0%) of the cohort were diagnosed with pathogenic \nvariants, likely pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS).” The researcher also \nfurthered the conclusions of  the WES high diagnostic rate by proving direct implications on clinical \nmanagement based on testing results. One patient who had a positive pathogenic BTD mutation, \ndiagnosed at seven -years old with a biotinidase deficiency, was started on biotin supplements after WES \ntesting, and was able to breathe independently off a ventilator, regain motor capabilities with physical \ntherapy, improve hearing, and elimin ate convulsions (Muthaffar, 2021) . \nUsing WES on eleven probands from ten Jordanian families who have been formerly diagnosed with \nlimb -girdle dystrophy (LGMD) and Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT), Ababneh et al. (2021)  identified \na series of missense, nonsense, and deletion variants associated with neuromuscular disorders. \nConsequently, the researchers argue that “Utilization of WES is helpful to facilitate rapid and accurate \nNMDs diagnosis, complementing a thorough cli nical evaluation”, especially in a country where the risk \nof autosomal -recessive disorders is increased by consanguinity and the implementation of genetic \ndiagnosis is limited and the results misunderstood (Ababneh et al., 2021) .  \nSanford et al. (2019)  investigated the clinical utility of rWGS in children within the pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU). They were able to make a molecular diagnosis by rWGS in 17 of 38 children, and in four \nof the 17 children diagnosed by rWGS (24%), “the genetic diagnose s led to a change in management \nwhile in the PICU, including genome -informed changes in pharmacotherapy and transition to palliative \ncare… Eighty -two percent of diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient and/or family \nafter PICU discharge, i ncluding avoidance of biopsy, administration of factor replacement, and \nsurveillance for disorder -related sequelae” (Sanford et al., 2019) . In this retrospective analysis, benefits \nof rWGS were further elucidated in the setting of unknown or unclear clinical etiologies.  \nReda et al. (2020)  studied WES for metastatic solid cancer diagnoses in 506 patients. In this study, the \nsomatic and germline exome analysis was restricted to 317 specific genes. Exome sequencing was \nsuccessful in 386 tumor samples, and 342 patients received a therapeutic p roposal based on their \ngenetic results. However, only 79 patients were treated with an NGS matched therapy. While this study \nshows that WES is a possible tool to assist with metastatic solid cancer diagnoses and treatments, “no \ndifferences were observed be tween PFS [progression -free survival] ratios of patients treated with \nmatched therapy versus standard therapy” (Reda et al., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 11 of 25 \n \nOther studies have also yielded bifurcating results on the periodic revisiting of unsolved exome cases \nand for variants of unknown significance. Salfati et al. (2019)  found that re -analysis of 101 WES cases \none to seven  years after initial analysis resulted in “the identification of additional diagnostic variants in \n3 rare disease cases (5.9%) and 1 sudden unexplained death case (2%), which increased our molecular \ndiagnostic yield to 31.4% and 12%, respectively.” However,  though they recognize the importance of \nany diagnostic yield to those families potentially affected, the authors also acknowledge that “most of \nour cases remain unexplained after our re -analysis”, which they attribute to an enduring lack of coverage \nof functional exonic variants, along with “the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease that is not \neasily dissected in small families, and the possibility of disease due to epigenetic, somatic, or other \nuninterrogated genomic aberrations.” As such, “We [ the authors] suggest that a 6 -month cycle of \nautomated re -analysis could improve the pace at which new findings are disseminated to patients. \nPeriodic re -analysis by third party or other software not originally used to analyze cases is also \npotentially use ful to uncover pathogenic variants that may be missed by the differences across genome \ninterpretation platforms” (Salfati et al., 2019) .  \nParent -child Trio Testing  \nParent -child trio testing is a strategy which helps to identify single pathogenic mutations among the \nmany genomic variants in an individual. Specifically, the sequencing of both the parents and the patient \nallows for the variant to be identified easier an d “filtered based on consistency or inconsistency \naccording to the laws of Mendelian inheritance” (Sakai et al., 2013) . \nLee et al. (2014)  reported on the initial clinical indications for clinical exome sequencing (CES) referrals \nand molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and different test types. CES was performed on \n814 patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions who underwent WES. CES was conducted \nusing a trio -CES technique which involves  both parents and their affected child sequenced \nsimultaneously. Overall, a molecular diagnosis with a causative variant in a well -established clinical gene \nwas provided for 213/ 814 (26%) cases. The trio -CES was associated with a higher molecular diagnostic \nyield (31%; 127/410 cases) than proband -CES or traditional molecular diagnostic methods. The \ninvestigators concluded that “additional studies designed to validate these finding s and to explore the \neffect of this approach on clinical and economic outcomes are warranted” (Lee et al., 2014) . \nSoden et al. (2014)  performed diagnostic WGS and/or WES in parent -child trios for 100 families with 119 \nchildren with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A total of 45% of the families received molecular \ndiagnoses of an established genetic disorder (53/119 affected children) . An accelerated sequencing \nmodality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families with acutely ill children (11/15). In this study, \nWES proved to be less costly than continued conventional diagnostic testing of children with NDD in \nwhom initial testing  failed to yield a diagnosis. The investigators concluded that “initial diagnostic \nevaluation of children with NDD should include trio WGS or WES, with extension of accelerated \nsequencing modalities to high -acuity patients” (Soden et al., 2014) . \nAnother study compared fetal WES versus trio analysis WES on fetuses with sonographic abnormalities. \nThe researchers found that trio analysis yielded a positive/definitive diagnosis in 30% (3/10) of the cases \nas compared to only 14.3% (2/14) of the singlet on cases. They conclude, “In order to expedite \ninterpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 12 of 25 \n \ncompromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes” (Drury et al., 2015) . Similarly, these data are \nsupported by another study of trio analysis of thirty different cases. A total of 10% of the cases were \npositive for a pathogenic finding, and 17% were de novo, inherited recessive, or X -linked variants. The \nauthors conclude, “T his study outlines the way for a substantial improvement in the diagnostic yield of \nprenatal genetic abnormalities through the application of next -generation sequencing” (Carss et al., \n2014) . \nYates et al. (2017)  performed WES, including trio analysis, using samples obtained from deceased fetuses \nwith ultrasound anomalies. They note that 20% of cases were positive overall with a definitive diagnosis \nwith another 45% positive for possible pathogenic candidate varia nts. Comparing trio analysis to \nsingleton analysis, 24% (n=11) of trio analysis resulted in a definitive diagnostic finding versus 14% (n=3) \nfor singleton testing (Yates et al., 2017) .  \nClark et al. (2018)  compared the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and CMA in children with \nsuspected genetic disorders. Trio analyses were also analyzed. Many studies were reviewed in this meta -\nanalysis; the authors state that “In 37 studies, comprising 20,068 chi ldren, diagnostic utility of WGS \n(0.41, 95% CI 0.34 -0.48, I2 = 44%) and WES (0.36, 95% CI 0.33 -0.40, I2 = 83%) were qualitatively greater \nthan CMA (0.10, 95% CI 0.08 -0.12, I2 = 81%) (Clark et al., 2018) . Further, a statistical difference was not \nfound regarding the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS. Finally, “Subgroups with higher WGS/WES \ndiagnostic utility were trios and those receiving hospital -based interpretation. WGS/WES should be \nconsidered a first -line genomic test for children with suspected genetic diseases” (Clark et al., 2018) . \nZhang et al. (2021)  performed WES and trio analysis on 18 unrelated men who have idiopathic \nhypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), which is a rare genetic disorder that causes delayed or absent \npuberty as well as infertility due to gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) insuffi ciency/deficiency, \nand their parents. With this testing, “one reported and 10 novel variants in eight known IHH causative \ngenes ( AXL, CCDC141, CHD7, DMXL2, FGFR1, PNPLA6, POLR3A, and PROKR2 ), nine variants in nine \nrecently reported candidate genes ( DCAF17,  DCC, EGF, IGSF10, NOTCH1, PDE3A, RELN, SLIT2, and \nTRAPPC9 ), and four variants in four novel candidate genes for IHH ( CCDC88C, CDON, GADL1,  and \nSPRED3 ) were identified in 77.8% (14/18) of IHH cases.” This analysis also supported oligogenic etiology \nfor disease presentation, with 44.4% cases carrying at least two variants in IHH -related genes. They also \nfound that the variants “tended to be maternally in herited (maternal with n = 17 vs paternal with n = 7; \nP = 0.028),” which was confirmed by their previous l iterature review, and due to the presence of female \ncarriers, extends the notion that females may be more tolerant of “deleterious” IHH -related gene \nmutations. This study exemplifies the clinical utility of WES and trio analysis for reproductive genetic \ndisorders and could be used to continue pedigree analyses for IHH (Zhang et al., 2021) . \nMalcher et al. (2022)  investigated the use of whole -genome sequencing in identifying new candidate \ngenes for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). The authors applied WGS for 39 patients with NOA to \nidentify novel NOA -associated SNVs, yielding “8 potentially disease causing [sic] variants in 4 genes, \nfollowed by 30 variants in 20 genes that were previously linked to infertility, and 20 variants in 13 genes \nthat have never been investigated with respect to male infertility but could be important in patients \nwith NOA” in 29 of the 3 9 azoospermic individuals. Of these 58 variants, 16 were newly discovered and, \nas such, “highly recommended to examine their possible function and mechanism of participation in \ngametogenesis” (Malcher et al., 2022) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 13 of 25 \n \nIn their examination of whole exome and genome sequencing in a Mendelian disorder cohort, Ewans et \nal. (2022)  determined that “WGS resulted in a diagnosis in one third (34%; 13/38 families) of \nundiagnosed families who had previously had WES.” However, when adjusting for “factors such as \nimprovements to gene -disease knowledge and genomic pipelines through contempo rary WES \nreanalysis, the WGS diagnostic yield reduced to 19% (6/31 remaining families)”, primarily due to “due \nto reduced WES coverage of critical regions that may be solved through an improved WES platform.” \nSuch results contribute to the debate about the  “trade -off between the lower cost of WES and the higher \ndiagnostic yield of WGS” and will ultimately be a function of “the clinical scenario and local resourcing \nand availability” (Ewans et al., 2022) . \nV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)  \nIn 2012, the ACMG released a policy statement outlining points to consider in the clinical application of \ngenomic sequencing to the detection of germ -line mutations. The ACMG recommended that WGS/WES \nshould be considered in the clinical diagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:  \n• “The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but the phenotype \ndoes not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic test targeting a specific gene is \navailable on a clinical basis.”  \n• “A patient presents with a defined genetic disorder that demonstrates a high degree of genetic \nheterogeneity, making WES or WGS analysis of multiple genes simultaneously a more practical \napproach.”  \n• “A patient presents with a likely genetic disorder, but specific genetic tests available for that \nphenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \n• “A fetus with a likely genetic disorder in which specific genetic tests, including targeted \nsequencing tests, available for that phenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \nACMG stated that “WGS/WES may be considered in preconception carrier screening, using a strategy to \nfocus on genetic variants known to be associated with significant phenotypes in homozygous or \nhemizygous progeny.” ACMG further stated that WGS and WES shou ld not be used at this time as an \napproach to prenatal screening or as a first -tier approach for newborn screening (ACMG, 2012) . \nACMG released a guideline on informed consent for genome/exome sequencing. In that guideline, they \nnoted that WGS/WES was not recommended “before the legal age of majority” unless for “phenotype -\ndriven clinical diagnostic uses or circumstances in which ear ly monitoring or interventions are available \nand effective” (ACMG, 2013) . \nIn 2014 the ACMG published guidelines (Alford et al., 2014)  for the clinical evaluation and etiologic \ndiagnosis of hearing loss which state: “Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's \ninformed consent, genetic testing, if available, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis —this testing \nmay include single -gene tests, hearing loss  sequencing  panels,  whole -exome  sequencing(WES),  whole -\ngenome  sequencing  (WGS), chromosome analysis, or microarray -based copy -number analysis, \ndepending on clinical findings.”  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 14 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG published guidelines on the use of fetal exome sequencing (ES) in prenatal diagnoses. \nThese guidelines are  below (Monaghan et al., 2020) : \nPretest Considerations  \n• “Exome sequencing may be considered for a fetus with ultrasound anomalies when standard CMA \nand karyotype analysis have failed to yield a definitive diagnosis. If a specific diagnosis is \nsuspected, molecular testing for the suggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) \nshould be the initial test. At the present time, there are no data supporting the clinical use for ES \nfor other reproductive indications, such as the identification of sonographic markers suggestive \nof aneuploidy or a history of re current unexplained pregnancy loss.  \n• Trio analysis consisting of the proband and both biological parents is preferred to singleton (fetus \nonly) or duo (fetus and one parent) analyses. Trio analysis consistently shows higher diagnostic \nyields compared with nontrio analysis. It allows for the i mmediate identification of de novo \nvariants, determination of phase for biallelic variants, and confirmation of carrier status in both \nparents when a homozygous variant is detected. For laboratories not requiring trio analysis for \nprenatal ES, all efforts should be made to determine inheritance of identified fetal variants with \ntargeted testing of the biological parents. There may be circumstances where both biological \nparents are unable to submit specimens. In this scenario, variant segregation testing usi ng the \navailable parent or testing of other closely related family members should be considered.  \n• Pretest counseling is ideally provided by a genetics  professional during which the types of variants \nthat may be returned in a laboratory report for all tested family members would be reviewed.  \nPosttest Considerations  \n• Post -test counseling is recommended, regardless of the test result. It should be provided by \nindividuals with relevant expertise, preferably a genetics professional.  \nReanalysis Considerations  \n• For patients with initial negative ES results, reanalysis of exome sequencing data aids clinical \ndiagnosis after 12 months. This outcome has been validated in the pediatric population as \nadditional phenotypic findings might be noted during a child’s growth  and development. \nContinuous updates in database resources and new publications may provide further information \nfor variant and gene classification.  \n• Due to the discovery of new gene –disease associations (that were unknown at the time of initial \nanalysis), reanalysis can also be considered for diagnostic results and results deemed to be \npossibly (but not definitively) associated with the fetal phenotype . \n• For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, reanalysis may be considered if a new \nphenotype develops in the proband after birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant \namount of time has passed (either at the discretion of the testing lab oratory or at least 12 months) \nsince the initial testing was performed.  \n• If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time, a reanalysis could be considered” (Monaghan et \nal., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 15 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG conducted a systematic evidence review to support guideline development for the \nuse of exome and genome sequencing among patients with congenital anomalies, developmental delay, \nor intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). From their review, the  ACMG concluded, “There is evidence that \nES/GS for patients with CA/ DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision -making, which could lead \nto improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate \nevidence regar ding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients \nwith CA/DD/ID” (Malinowski et al., 2020) . \nIn 2021 the ACMG asserted that as the body of literature surrounding this continues to burgeon, it urges \nthem to “strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second -tier test (guided by clinical judgment \nand often clinician –patient/family shared decisi on making after CMA or focused testing) for patients \nwith one or more CAs prior to one year of age or for patients with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage” (Manickam et al., 2021) .  \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal and Fetal \nMedicine (SFM)  \nIn 2016 the ACOG and SFM published a joint committee opinion on “ Microarrays and Next -Generation \nSequencing Technology: The Use of Advanced Genetic Diagnostic Tools in Obstetrics and Gynecology”, \nwhich states that “the routine use of whole -genome or whole -exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis \nis not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer reviewed data and \nvalidation studies are published” (ACOG & SFM, 2016) .  \nHowever, ACOG and SFM note that WES may be considered when “specific genetic tests available for a \nphenotype, including targeted sequencing tests, have failed to determine a diagnosis in a fetus with \nmultiple congenital anomalies suggestive of a genetic di sorder.” The guideline further clarifies that “in \nselect circumstances (recurrent or lethal fetal anomalies in which other approaches have been \nnoninformative), [WES] may be considered as a diagnostic tool, but only after other appropriate testing \nhas been  noninformative and after extensive counseling by an [OB -GYN[ or other health care provider \nwith genetics expertise who is familiar with these new technologies and their limitations” (ACOG & SFM, \n2016) . This committee opinion was reaffirmed in 2023.  \nJoint Position Statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD), the Society for \nMaternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF)  \nPer the guideline, the word “sequencing” is used to refer to “whole exome sequencing, targeted analysis \nusing clinical panels, and whole genome sequencing.”  \n“The use of diagnostic sequencing is currently being introduced for evaluation of fetuses for whom \nstandard diagnostic genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), has already been \nperformed and is uninformative or is offered concurrentl y according to accepted practice guidelines, or \nfor whom expert genetic opinion determines that standard genetic testing is less optimal than \nsequencing for the presenting fetal phenotype” (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nRoutine use of prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot be supported due to “insufficient” \nvalidation and data about benefits and pitfalls (ISPD et al., 2018) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 16 of 25 \n \nWithin the section on recommendations for all diagnostic applications of genome -wide sequencing, \nconcerning trio analysis, they state, “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio \nanalysis, where fetal and both parental samples are s equenced and analyzed together. The trio approach \ncurrently benefits timeliness of result interpretation and aids assignment of pathogenicity for detected \nsequence variants. If proband‐only sequencing is performed, validation of diagnostic or potentially \ndiagnostic findings best includes a determination of inheritance through targeted testing of samples \nfrom biological parents” (ISPD et al., 2018) . However, the guideline could not recommend one \nsequencing method over another, nor was the guideline certain on the best way to interpret variants \nfound in genome -wide sequencing.  \nThe guideline provides three scenarios in which fetal sequencing may be “beneficial”:  \n“A current pregnancy with a fetus with a single major anomaly or with multiple organ system anomalies \nthat are suggestive of a possible genetic etiology, but no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA; or in \nselect situations with no CMA result, following a multidisciplinary review and consensus, in which there \nis a fetus with a multiple anomaly ‘pattern’ that strongly suggests a single gene disorder.”  \n“A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with a major \nsingle anomaly or multiple anomalies suggestive of a genetic etiology, and a recurrence of similar \nanomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic  diagnosis after karyotype or CMA. In addition, \nwhen such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected \nproband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it is considered appropriate \nto of fer sequencing for both biological parents to look for shared carrier status for autosomal recessive \nmutations that might explain the fetal phenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a \nprevious abnormal fetus or child for exome sequencing is  preferable.”  \n“In families with a history of recurrent stillbirths of unknown etiology after karyotype and/or CMA, \nwhere the fetus in the current pregnancy has a recurrent pattern of anomalies (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD released an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for \nprenatal diagnosis. Below are the pertinent recommendations:  \n• “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio analysis, where fetal and both \nparental samples are sequenced and analyzed together.”  \n• “Approaches to sequence analysis may vary from examination of genes known to be associated \nwith fetal or neonatal phenotypes to a broader genome -wide strategy. It is also uncertain whether \ninterpretation of variants found by genome -wide sequencing should f ollow the general guidelines \nfor interpretation and reporting of results for children and adults, or whether a more restrictive \napproach, limited to those variants that explain the phenotype is preferable in the prenatal \nsetting, or if a new approach restr icting reporting to severe childhood conditions should be \nconsidered.”  \n• “The current existing data support that prenatal sequencing is beneficial for the following \nindications:  \no A current pregnancy with a fetus having a major single anomaly or multiple organ anomalies:  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 17 of 25 \n \n▪ For which no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA and a clinical genetic expert review \nconsiders the phenotype suggestive of a possible genetic etiology.  \n▪ For which the multiple anomaly “pattern” strongly suggests a single gene disorder with \nno prior genetic testing. As pES is not currently validated to detect all CNVs, CMA should \nbe run before or in parallel with pES in this scenario.  \no A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with \na major single or multiple anomalies:  \n▪ With a recurrence of similar anomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic \ndiagnosis after karyotype or CMA for the current or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \n▪ When such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from \nthe affected proband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it \nis considered appropriate to offer sequencing for both biological parents to lo ok for \nshared carrier status for autosomal recessive mutations that might explain the fetal \nphenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a previous abnormal fetus or \nchild for pES is preferable.  \n• There is currently no evidence that supports routine testing (including upon parental request) on \nfetal tissue obtained from an invasive prenatal procedure (amniocentesis, CVS, cordocentesis, \nother) for indications other than fetal anomalies  \no There may be special settings when prenatal sequencing in the absence of a fetal phenotype \nvisible on prenatal imaging can be considered, such as with a strong family history of a \nrecurrent childhood‐onset severe genetic condition with no prenatal phenotyp e in previous \nchildren for whom no genetic evaluation was done and is not possible. Such scenarios should \nbe reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team preferentially in the context of a research \nprotocol. If sequencing is done for this indication, it mu st be done as trio sequencing, using \nan appropriate analytical approach” (Van den Veyver et al., 2022) . \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Kang et al., 2015)  on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management \nof congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) which state: “In individuals with CMD who either do not have \na mutation identified in one of the commonly associated genes or have a phenotype whose genetic \norigins have n ot been well characterized, physicians might order whole -exome or whole -genome \nsequencing when those technologies become more accessible and affordable for routine clinical use \n(Level C).”  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Narayanaswami et al., 2014)  on the diagnosis and treatment of \nlimb -girdle and distal dystrophies which state: “In patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom \ninitial clinically directed genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic \nconsultation o r perform parallel  sequencing  of targeted exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -\ngenome screening, or next -generation  sequencing  to identify the genetic abnormality (Level C).”  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology (AMP)  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 18 of 25 \n \nThe AMP published a report on the spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing \nprocedures for inherited conditions and cancer. The background of this report states, “Whole genome \nsequencing is currently more expensive than WES, requires gr eater analysis, and generates more \nvariants of uncertain significance. WES is a plausible approach when the clinical picture cannot be \naffirmed using a specific gene panel. As technologies and understanding of variants advance, whole \ngenome sequencing migh t become the test of choice” (Joseph et al., 2016) . \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  \nAAP published guidelines on the evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorder. According to the \nguidelines, CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. Since Fragile \nX Syndrome increases the risk for autism spectrum  disorder, DNA testing for Fragile X should be \nrecommended in all children with ASD, especially for boys and children with a family history of \nintellectual disability. “The cytosine -guanine -guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion that is responsible \nfor fra gile X syndrome is not detected on CMA and must be ordered as a separate test. When the history \nand physical examination, CMA, and fragile X analysis do not identify an etiology, the next step at this \ntime in the etiologic evaluation for [autism spectrum d isorder] is whole -exome sequencing (WES).” AAP \ndoes not recommend the use of commercially marketed tests as they do not provide a molecular \netiologic diagnosis (Hyman et al., 2020) .  \nCanadian College of Medical Geneticists  \nIn 2015, the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists published a position statement on genome -wide \nsequencing for monogenic diseases. Their relevant recommendations include the following:  \n• “Recommendations for diagnostic assessment:  \no Clinical exome sequencing, at this time, should only be used to interrogate the genome for \nnucleotide sequence variants in genes known to cause disease. Clinical WGS may be used to \ndetect CNV and structural variation in addition to sequence variants, thoug h it is not currently \na first -tier test for such analyses.  \no Clinical genome -wide sequencing should be considered in the investigation of an affected \nindividual when his/her phenotype or family history suggests a monogenic aetiology in whom \nthe causal mutation(s) are unknown, and one or more of the following additio nal conditions \napply:  \n▪ the phenotype is associated with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity;  \n▪ specific genetic tests have failed to arrive at a diagnosis and testing of other clinically \nrelevant genes is appropriate;  \n▪ genome -wide sequencing is a more cost -effective approach than available individual gene \nor gene panel testing.”  \n• “Until the benefits of reporting incidental findings are established, we do not endorse the \nintentional clinical analysis of disease -associated genes other than those linked to the primary \nindication.”  \nBelow is a figure of a “decision aid to facilitate the diagnostic evaluation of patients with rare disease of \nsuspected monogenic aetiology” (Boycott et al., 2015) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 19 of 25 \n \n \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians  \nIn 2021, the Royal Austalasian  College of Physicians provided guidelines on pediatric genetic testing in \nthe context of intellectual disability (ID) and global developmental delay (GDD). For childhood \nsyndromes or ID/GDD, the group recommends WES or WGS as tests of choice, since they o ffer “a broad, \nagnostic screen,” but acknowledge that WES is more widely available and cost -effective at the time of \npublication. In terms of ordering singleton or trio testing, the group states that “the latter (trio) approach \nis highly recommended given it simplifies analysis… it is also a more streamlined clinical test as trio \ntesting identifies fewer variants of uncertain significance than singleton testing” (Sachdev et al., 2021) . \nVI.

Unless the affected individual is a member of \nan ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic \nvariants are known, comprehensive genetic testing (i.e., full sequencing of the \ngenes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.  \n If no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests \ntesting first- or second-degree family members affected with cancer thought to be \nrelated to deleterious  variants (e.g., prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, \nmelanoma). \n If no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are: \n Full sequencing followed by testing for  large genomic rearrangements \n(deletions, duplications) only if sequencing detects no variant (negative \nresult). \n More than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.  \n Alternatively, simultaneous full sequencing and testing for  large genomic \nrearrangements (also known as comprehensive testing; see Comprehensive \nVariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN. \n Comprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA 1 or BRCA2  variants. \n Testing for variants through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for \nefficiency. Multi-gene panels often include genes of moderate or low penetrance, and \ngenes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering \na gene panel, NCCN recommends use of “tailored panels that are disease-focused and \ninclude clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes”. \n Ashkenazi Jewish descent \n If patient is of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, 1 approach is to test for \nthe 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC in BRCA1 ; 6174delT \nin BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual’s \nancestry also included non-Ashkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2 testing \ncriteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.  \nComprehensive Variant Analysis \nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron \nand exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large deletions and rearrangements that \ncan be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large \ndeletions and rearrangements was not performed, thus some patients with familial breast \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (FORMERLY \nGERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (BRCA1,  \nBRCA2,  PALB2)) \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.211 \n \nEffective 1/1/2025  Page 7  \ncancer who had negative variant testing before this time may consider repeat testing for the \nrearrangements (see Policy section for criteria). \nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups \nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-\ncharacterized founder mutations should begin with tests specifically for these variants. For \nexample, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants \nfound in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. When testing for founder mutations is \nnegative, comprehensive variant analysis should then be performed. \nTesting Unaffected Individuals \nIn unaffected family members of potential  variant families, most test results will be negative and \nuninformative. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that an affected  family member be tested \nfirst whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a  variant be found in an affected \nfamily member(s), DNA from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the \nsame variant of the affected family member without having to sequence the entire \ngene. Interpreting test results for an unaffected family member without knowing the genetic \nstatus of the family may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-\nassociated variant but leads to difficulties in interpreting negative test results (uninformative \nnegative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative  variant is \nnot ruled out. \nTesting Minors \nThe American Academy of Pediatrics states that “predictive genetic testing for adult-onset \nconditions generally should be deferred unless an intervention initiated in childhood may reduce \nmorbidity or mortality. An exception might be made for families for whom diagnostic uncertainty \nposes a significant psychosocial burden, particularly when an adolescent and his or her parents \nconcur in their interest in predictive testing”. \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors “encourages deferring predictive genetic testing of \nminors for adult-onset conditions when results will not impact childhood medical management or \nsignificantly benefit the child. Predictive testing should optimally be deferred until the individual \nhas the capacity to weigh the associated risks, benefits, and limitations of this information, \ntaking his/her circumstances, preferences, and beliefs into account to preserve his/her \nautonomy and right to an open future”. \nProstate Cancer \nIndividuals with high penetrant variants have an increased risk of prostate cancer, and \nindividuals with known high penetrant variants may, therefore, consider more aggressive \nscreening approaches for prostate cancer.  \nGenetic Counseling \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (FORMERLY \nGERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (BRCA1,  \nBRCA2,  PALB2)) \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.211 \n \nEffective 1/1/2025  Page 8  \nGenetic counseling is primarily aimed at patients who are at risk for inherited disorders, and \nexperts recommend formal genetic counseling in most cases when genetic testing for an \ninherited condition is considered.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        Top \nHereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome \nSeveral genetic syndromes with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that features \nbreast cancer have been identified. Of these, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) \nsyndrome and some cases of hereditary site-specific breast cancer have in common causative \nvariants in BRCA  (breast cancer susceptibility) genes. Families suspected of having HBOC \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (FORMERLY \nGERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (BRCA1,  \nBRCA2,  PALB2)) \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.211 \n \nEffective 1/1/2025  Page 9  \nsyndrome are characterized by an increased susceptibility to breast cancer occurring at a young \nage, bilateral breast cancer, male breast cancer, ovarian cancer at any age, as well as cancer of \nthe fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer. Other cancers, such as prostate cancer, \npancreatic cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, melanoma, and laryngeal cancer, occur more \nfrequently in HBOC families. Hereditary site-specific breast cancer families are characterized by \nearly-onset breast cancer with or without male cases, but without ovarian cancer. For this \nevidence review, Capital refers collectively to both as hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer . \nGermline variants in the BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes are responsible for the cancer susceptibility \nin most HBOC families, especially if ovarian cancer or male breast cancer are features. \nHowever, in site-specific cancer, BRCA variants are responsible only for a proportion of affected \nfamilies. BRCA  gene variants are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion through maternal \nor paternal lineage. It is possible to test for abnormalities in BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes to \nidentify the specific variant in cancer cases and to identify family members at increased cancer \nrisk. Family members without existing cancer who are found to have BRCA  variants can \nconsider preventive interventions for reducing risk and mortality. \nEvidence suggests that genetic services are not equitably applied. Chapman-Davis et al (2021) \nfound that non-Hispanic Whites and Asians were more likely to be referred for genetic services \nbased solely on family history than were non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics. In addition, non-\nHispanic Black patients and Hispanic patients were more likely to have advanced cancer when \nreferred for genetic services than non-Hispanic Whites and Asians. \nThe National Cancer Institute estimated there would be 297,790 new cases of female breast \ncancer (FBC) and 2,800 cases of male breast cancer (MBC) diagnosed in 2023, with an \nexpected 43,170 deaths due to FBC and 530 deaths due to MBC. Although non-Hispanic, white \nwomen are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than non-Hispanic Black, \nAsian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native and Hispanic women, non-Hispanic Black \nwomen have the highest risk of breast cancer mortality. Breast cancers can be classified as \nsporadic, familial, or hereditary. Most breast cancers are sporadic (70% to 75%), occurring in \nwomen without a family history of the disease. Familial cancers (15% to 25%) aggregate within \nfamilies but lack clearly discernable patterns of inheritance and are likely polygenic. Hereditary \ncancers have discernable inheritance patterns, often occur at younger ages, may be bilateral, \nand comprise between 5% and 10% of breast cancers. Most inherited autosomal dominant \nbreast cancer can be attributed to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. For women who inherit a \npathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants, 45% to 72% will develop breast cancer by 70-80 years \nof age; risk in men with BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants is much lower (1% and 7%, respectively).   \nPathogenic variants in other highly penetrant genes (e.g., TP53, CDH1, PTEN, STK11) \ncontribute to a smaller number of cancer cases. CHEK2 and ATM are believed to be moderately \npenetrant and BARD1 has alternatively been described as moderate, low/moderate, and low \npenetrance. \nClinical Features Suggestive of BRCA Variant \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (FORMERLY \nGERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (BRCA1,  \nBRCA2,  PALB2)) \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.211 \n \nEffective 1/1/2025  Page 10  \nYoung age of onset of breast cancer, even in the absence of family history, is a risk factor \nfor BRCA1 variants. Winchester (1996) estimated that hereditary breast cancers account for \n36% to 85% of patients diagnosed before age 30 years. In several studies, BRCA  variants were \nindependently predicted by early age at onset, being present in 6% to 10% of breast cancer \ncases diagnosed at ages younger than various premenopausal age cutoffs (age range, 35 to 50 \nyears). In cancer-prone families, the mean age of breast cancer diagnosis among women \ncarrying BRCA1  or BRCA2 variants is in the 40s. In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, Frank et \nal (2002) reported that 13% of 248 cases with no known family history and diagnosed before 50 \nyears of age had BRCA variants. In a similar study by Gershoni-Baruch et al (2000), 31% of \nAshkenazi Jewish women, unselected for family history, diagnosed with breast cancer at \nyounger than 42 years of age had BRCA variants. Other studies have indicated that early age of \nbreast cancer diagnosis is a significant predictor of BRCA variants in the absence of family \nhistory in this population. \nAs in the general population, a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, particularly of early \nage onset, is a significant risk factor for a BRCA  variant in ethnic populations characterized by \nfounder mutations. For example, in unaffected individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, 12% to \n31% will have a BRCA  variant depending on the extent and nature of the family history. Several \nother studies have documented the significant influence of family history. \nIn patients with “triple-negative” breast cancer (i.e., negative for expression of estrogen, \nprogesterone, and overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 receptors), \nthere is an increased prevalence of BRCA variants. Pathophysiologic research has suggested \nthat the physiologic pathway for the development of triple-negative breast cancer is similar to \nthat for BRCA -associated breast cancer. In 200 randomly selected patients with triple-negative \nbreast cancer from a tertiary care center, Kandel et al (2006) reported there was a greater than \n3-fold increase in the expected rate of BRCA variants. BRCA1 variants were found in 39.1% of \npatients and BRCA2 variants in 8.7%. Young et al (2009) studied 54 women with high-grade, \ntriple-negative breast cancer with no family history of breast or ovarian cancer, representing a \ngroup that previously was not recommended for BRCA  testing. Six BRCA variants (5 BRCA1 , \n1 BRCA2 ) were found, for a variant rate of 11%. Finally, Gonzalez-Angulo et al (2011) in a study \nof 77 patients with triple-negative breast cancer, reported that 15 patients (19.5%) had BRCA \nvariants (12 in BRCA1 , 3 in BRCA2 ). \nPALB2  Gene \nThe PALB2  gene (partner and localizer of BRCA2 ) encodes for a protein first described in \n2006. The gene is located at 16p12.2 [Short (p) arm of chromosome 16 at position 12.2.] and \nhas 13 exons. PALB2 protein assists BRCA2  in DNA repair and tumor suppression. \nHeterozygous pathogenic PALB2 variants increase the risk of developing breast and pancreatic \ncancers; homozygous variants are found in Fanconi anemia. Fanconi anemia is a rare disorder, \nprimarily affecting children, that causes bone marrow failure. Affected individuals also carry a \nrisk of cancers including leukemia. Most pathogenic PALB2  variants are truncating frameshift or \nstop codons and are found throughout the gene. Pathogenic PALB2  variants are uncommon in \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (FORMERLY \nGERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (BRCA1,  \nBRCA2,  PALB2)) \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.211 \n \nEffective 1/1/2025  Page 11  \nunselected populations and prevalence varies by ethnicity and family history. For example, \nAntoniou et al (2014) assumed a prevalence of 8 per 10,000 in the general population when \nmodeling breast cancer risks. Variants are more prevalent in ethnic populations where founder \nmutations have persisted (e.g., Finns, French Canadians, Poles), while infrequently found in \nothers (e.g., Ashkenazi Jews). In women with a family history of breast cancer, the prevalence \nof pathogenic PALB2  variants ranges between 0.9% and 3.9%, or substantially higher than in \nan unselected general population. Depending on population prevalence, PALB2  may be \nresponsible for as much as 2.4% of hereditary breast cancers; and in populations with founder \nmutations cause 0.5% to 1% of all breast cancers. \nCHEK2 Gene  \nThe CHEK2  (checkpoint kinase 2) gene is activated in response to DNA double-strand \nbreakage and plays a role in cell-cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis. \nIn 2002, a single recurrent truncating mutation in the CHEK2  gene (c.1100delC) was first \nreported as a cause of breast cancer, and studies have since confirmed this. The incidence of \nCHEK2  variants varies widely among populations. It is most prevalent in Eastern and Northern \nEurope, where the population frequency of the c.1100delC allele ranges from 0.5% to 1.4%; the \nallele is less frequent in North America and virtually absent in Spain and India. When compared \nwith non-Hispanic, white individuals, prevalence appears to be lower in Black (odds ratio [OR] \n0.17; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.33), Asian (OR 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.34), and Hispanic (OR 0.36; \n95% CI, 0.18 to 0.62) individuals.  \nAlthough most data for truncating CHEK2  variants are limited to the c.1100delC allele, 3 other \nfounder variants of CHEK2  (IVS2+1G>A, del5395, I157T) have been associated with breast \ncancer in Eastern Europe. Both IVS2+1G>A and del5395 are protein-truncating variants, and \nI157T is a missense variant. The truncating variants are associated with breast cancer in the \nSlavic populations of Poland, Belarus, Russia, and the Czech Republic. The I157T variant has a \nwider geographic distribution and has been reported to be associated with breast cancer in \nPoland, Finland, Germany, and Belarus. \nATM Gene \nATM  (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated), located on chromosome 11q22.3, is associated with the \nautosomal recessive condition ataxia-telangiectasia. This condition is characterized by \nprogressive cerebellar ataxia with onset between the ages of 1 and 4 years, telangiectasias of \nthe conjunctivae, oculomotor apraxia, immune defects, and cancer predisposition. Female ATM \nheterozygotes carriers have a risk of breast cancer about twice as high as that of the general \npopulation; however, they do not appear to have an elevated ovarian cancer risk. \nBARD1 Gene \nThe BARD1  (BRCA1-associated RING [Really Interesting New Gene] domain) gene is located \non chromosome 2 (sequence 2q34-q35). BARD1  encodes a protein which interacts with the N-\nterminal region of BRCA1 , and BARD1  and BRCA1  can form a heterodimer by their N-terminal \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (FORMERLY \nGERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (BRCA1,  \nBRCA2,  PALB2)) \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.211 \n \nEffective 1/1/2025  Page 12  \nRING finger domains which form a stable complex. BARD1  variants have been associated with \nan increased risk of estrogen-receptor (ER) negative breast cancer, triple-negative breast \ncancer, and with breast cancer at a younger age (under age 50 years) in some studies, but do \nnot appear to increase risk of ovarian cancer. \nRNA Testing \nA counseling dilemma is posed by the finding of a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). VUS \nis a variation in a genetic sequence for which the association with disease risk is unclear. The \ngenetic alteration may actually represent a benign polymorphism unrelated to an increased \ncancer risk or it may indicate an increased cancer risk. While a VUS should not be used to \nguide clinical management, additional testing can be considered to help reclassify the variant. \nOne of the most currently used methods is RNA analytics. RNA testing can be performed after \nsingle gene or panel testing to help reclassify VUS. Increasingly, paired DNA and RNA testing \nare being performed at the same time to identify patients with or at risk for hereditary cancer \nwho might otherwise be missed and decrease VUS in real-time.  \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who have cancer or a personal or family cancer history and meet criteria \nsuggesting a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1 or BRCA2  \nvariant, the evidence includes a TEC Assessment and studies of variant prevalence and cancer \nrisk. Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-specific survival, test validity, and quality \nof life. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of \ncancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%. Knowledge of BRCA  \nvariant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to \nreduce risk, including intensive surveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. \nIn individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy \nhave been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and overall survival. \nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed with breast cancer may impact \ntreatment decisions. A randomized controlled trial has reported that patients with human \nepidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA  variant \nexperienced significantly longer progression-free survival with a targeted therapy vs standard \ntherapy. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful \nimprovement in the net health outcome. \nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (e.g., cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, \nand prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1 or BRCA2  variant, the evidence includes \nstudies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-\nspecific survival, test validity, and quality of life. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown \nto be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can \ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy, and enrollment in clinical trials. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (FORMERLY \nGERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (BRCA1,  \nBRCA2,  PALB2)) \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.211 \n \nEffective 1/1/2025  Page 13  \nThe evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement \nin the net health outcome. \nFor individuals with HBOC syndrome and ovarian cancer or other high-risk cancers considering \nsystemic therapy options who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1 or BRCA2  variant, the \nevidence includes several randomized controlled trials (RCT) and single-arm trials. Relevant \noutcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity, and quality of life. The numerous \nplacebo-controlled RCTs of poly (adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor \ndrugs have consistently demonstrated that, in individuals with ovarian cancer and a \ngermline BRCA  variant, treatment with PARP inhibitor drugs significantly improve progression-\nfree survival time. In individuals with BRCA -mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate \ncancer, a single-arm clinical trial of rucaparib demonstrated a benefit on a surrogate outcome of \nobjective response rate and evaluation of its effects on progression-free survival is pending \ncompletion of the ongoing randomized, standard care-controlled confirmatory TRITON3 trial \n(NCT02975934). Rates of overall Grade 3 or 4 adverse events ranged from 25.5% to 63.2% \nacross PARP inhibitor drugs. The evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results \nin an improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, \nthe evidence includes studies of clinical validity and studies of breast cancer risk, including a \nmeta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity. Evidence \nsupporting clinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or \nodds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-cohort, family-based case-\ncontrol, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in \nstudies varied from 1 (founder mutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with \na PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the lowest \nvalues. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying \non studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers. These interventions include screening with \nmagnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy. Given the \npenetrance of PALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing \nmastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with hereditary breast cancer \n(including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the \nbenefit-to-risk balance affected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer \nwho would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2 variant provides a more \nprecise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can \noffer women a more accurate understanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. \nThe evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nFor individuals with HBOC Syndrome or other high-risk cancers and individuals with a risk of \nHBOC Syndrome or other-high risk cancers who receive genetic testing for CDH1, PTEN, \nSTK11, TP53, ATM, BRIP1, Lynch syndrome genes [MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, EPCAM], RAD51C, \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (FORMERLY \nGERMLINE GENETIC TESTING FOR HEREDITARY BREAST /OVARIAN \nCANCER SYNDROME AND OTHER HIGH-RISK CANCERS (BRCA1,  \nBRCA2,  PALB2)) \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.211 \n \nEffective 1/1/2025  Page 14  \nRAD51D, CDKN2A, CHEK2, and HOXB13, the evidence includes societal guidance from \nNCCN. Due to their recommendation for testing in Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: \nBreast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic, the evidence is sufficient to determine that the technology \nresults in an improvement in the net health outcome.  \n \nFor individuals who receive RNA based genetic testing, there is limited data available. Larger, \nwell-designed prospective studies are needed which demonstrate the clinical utility of RNA \nanalysis alone or paired with DNA analysis to aid in the classification of VUS or to otherwise \ndetect, diagnose or manage cancer. Differences in how RNA analysis is interpreted between \nlaboratories can lead to discrepancies in variant classification.

Policy Description  \n \nWhole genome sequencing (WGS) is the strategy of using next -generation technology to sequence the \nentire genome. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) refers to sequencing of the exome, the component of \nthe genome that predominantly encode proteins. Next generation  sequencing (NGS) involves \nsequencing of multiple small fragments of DNA in parallel, producing fast, accurate sequencing results \n(Hulick, 2024).  \n \nThis policy is applicable for undiagnosed rare germline disorders.  \n \nII.

Scientific Background   \nDNA sequencing is a critical tool for the evaluation of many medical conditions. The two primary \nmethods of DNA sequencing in the clinical setting are Sanger sequencing and next -generation \nsequencing or NGS. NGS is a technique that allows for the rapid seq uencing of multiple strands of DNA. \nIt is not limited to one specific type of test; rather it encompasses numerous technologies that produce \nswift and high -volume sequencing. NGS can be used to sequence larger sequences, such as the exome \nor the entire gen ome. This is opposed to the traditional Sanger sequencing, which is more useful for \nsequencing a specific gene (Hulick, 2024) . \nThe NGS procedure typically includes the following steps: first the patient’s DNA is prepared to serve as \na template, then DNA fragments are isolated (on solid surfaces such as small beads) where sequence \ndata is generated. Then these results are compared against a reference genome. Any DNA sample may \nbe used if the quality and quantity of that sample is sufficient, but the methods of library generation and \ndata analysis often vary from panel to panel. Evaluating the results of a gene panel typically requir es \nexpertise in bioinformatics. Since NGS reports data on any variants found, great care must be taken to \nevaluate these gene variants, especially variants of unknown significance (VUS) and secondary findings \n(Hulick, 2024; Rehm et al., 2013) .  \nExome and genome sequencing are usually performed with NGS. The exome represents all the protein -\nencoding genes, and at least 85% of pathogenic mutations are found in the exome. Further, the exome \nonly comprises approximately 1.5% -2% of the genome, thereby  making it more cost effective to \nsequence than whole genome sequencing. The entire exome includes approximately 30 megabases \ncompared to the genome’s 3.3 gigabases. However, sequencing an entire genome may be useful as a \npathogenic mutation may be in a no ncoding region of the genome, such as gene regulation dysfunction. \nMost clinical NGS testing uses targeted panels or whole exome sequencing (WES), and whole genome \nsequencing (WGS) is only used in select cases. For instance, conditions such as nonsyndromic  hearing \nloss (possible pathogenic variants in over 60 genes) may benefit from WES evaluation (Hulick, 2024) .  \nSeveral companies have pivoted towards focused exome sequencing. These are panels tailored to \nindividual phenotypes and target a maximum number of genes depending on the company. There is a \n>30% diagnostic yield, with freedom for clinicians to choose speci fic genes they are interested in, with \nreduced cost and options to reflex to WES for negative cases (GGC, 2022) . In their study, Jia et al. (2023)  \nretrospectively analyzed 372 pediatric patients who were referred to clinically focused exome \nsequencing (CFES), and concluded that CFES may be first -line for “diagnosing young children with \nsuspected genetic conditions, as it validates the identification  of molecular genetics alterations and \nfacilitates comprehensive medical management. The patients that were more likely to receive diagnoses \nvia CFES were those with “metabolism/homeostasis abnormalities, craniofacial /otolaryngology/ \nophthalmologic abnorm alities, and/or [abnormalities of] the integument” (Jia et al., 2023) . Despite the \nnovelty and expected benefits of focused exome sequencing, more clinical studies with larger sample \nsizes are necessary.  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 8 of 25 \n \nProprietary Testing  \nMany proprietary technologies for WES and WGS are available. Companies such as Variantyx provide \nhighly specialized genetic testing to patients and clinicians. The Genomic Unity® Exome Plus Analysis test \nsequences the exome, including intronic and regulato ry variants, identifies disease causing deletions or \nduplications in the genome, and analyzes the mitochondrial genome with heteroplasmy (≥5%). This test \nmay identify many genes for a variety of disorders including AR, ATN1, ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, ATXN7, \nATXN8OS, ATXN10, C9ORF72, CACNA1A, CNBP, CSTB, DMPK, FMR1, FXN, HTT, JPH3, NOP56, \nNOTCH2NLC, PABPN1, PPP2R2B, TBP  (for adult -onset movement disorders), AFF2, DIP2B, FMR1  (for \nearly -onset intellectual disability disorders), and PHOX2B, TCF4  (for other disorders) (variantyx, 2020) . \nThis test requires either a blood, saliva or gDNA (genomic DNA) sample and has an eight -week \nturnaround time.  \nClinical Utility and Validity  \nAlfares et al. (2018)  compared the cost -effectiveness and clinical utility of both WES and WGS. Data was \nanalyzed from 108 participants; all 108 individuals had negative array comparative genomic \nhybridization (also known as chromosomal microarray) results and negative or inco nclusive WES results \nbefore WGS was performed. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is another common genetic testing \nmethod that can analyze many pieces of DNA simultaneously. The authors only pinpointed three positive \ncases where WGS identified a genetic or inhe rited disorder that WES did not recognize; further, it was \nnoted that “30% of the positive cases identified by WGS could be identified by reanalyzing the WES raw \ndata, and WGS achieved an only 7% higher detection rate. Therefore, until the cost of WGS appr oximates \nthat of WES, reanalyzing WES raw data is recommended before performing WGS” (Alfares et al., 2018) . \nYang et al. (2014)  conducted a single -center observational study of 2000 patients with clinical whole \nexome sequencing performed for a suspected genetic disorder. A molecular diagnosis was reported for \n504 patients (25.2%) with 58% of the diagnostic mutations not previously  reported. The investigators \nconcluded that “the yield of whole -exome sequencing may offer advantages over traditional molecular \ndiagnostic approaches in certain patients” (Yang et al., 2014) . Best et al. (2018)  reviewed 31 different \nWES studies and noted that the diagnostic rates varied between 6.2% and 80%; however, the \nresearchers state that the “differences in inclusion criteria and trio versus singleton approaches to \nsequencing largely account for the wide r ange of diagnostic rates.”  \nTammimies et al. (2015)  evaluated the molecular diagnostic yield of CMA and WES in children with \nautism spectrum disorder (ASD). The patient cohort included 258 consecutively enrolled unrelated \nchildren with ASD, stratified into three groups based on the presence of major congen ital abnormalities \nand minor physical anomalies. All probands underwent CMA, with WES performed for 95 proband -\nparent trios. The molecular diagnostic yields of CMA and WES were comparable. Among the 95 patients \nundergoing WES, eight  children (8.4%)  received an ASD -related molecular diagnosis. Among the children \nwho underwent both CMA and WES testing, the estimated proportion with an identifiable genetic \netiology was 15.8%. The investigators concluded that “if replicated in additional  populations, these \nfindings may inform appropriate selection of molecular diagnostic testing for children affected by ASD” \n(Tammimies et al., 2015) . A similar study was performed by Arteche -López et al. (2021)  to validate WES \nas a “first -tier test for the genetic diagnosis of [ASD], when there is no suspicion of fragile X syndrome.” \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 9 of 25 \n \nUpon comparing the clinical utility of CMA, FMR1  testing, and WES testing, the researchers “achieved a \nglobal diagnostic rate of 12.8% (44/343), the majority of them being characterised by WES (33/44; 75%) \ncompared to CMA (9/44; 20.4%) or  FMR1  testing (2/44; 4.5%),” evidently demonstrating the “higher \ndiagnostic power” of WES compared to CMA (Arteche -López et al., 2021) . \nTaylor et al. (2015)  performed whole genome sequencing in 217 individuals across a broad spectrum of \ngenetic disorders in whom previous screening had identified no pathogenic variants. Disease -causing \nvariants were identified in 21% of cases, with the proportion increasing to  34% (23/68) for mendelian \ndisorders and 57% (8/14) in family trios. The investigators concluded that the results “demonstrate the \nvalue of genome sequencing for routine clinical diagnosis but also highlight many outstanding \nchallenges” (Taylor et al., 2015) . \nMiller et al. (2017)  performed exome/whole genome sequencing to identify the genetic cause in patients \nwith craniosynostosis, in whom prior clinically driven genetic testing had been negative. Out of the 40 \npatients’ tests, associated mutations were identified in 15 patients (37.5%) involving 14 different genes. \nIn five of the 15 positive cases, the molecular diagnosis had immediate, actionable consequences in \npatient management. The investigators concluded that “the benefits of exome/whole genome \nsequencing to identify causal  mutations in craniosynostosis cases for which routine clinical testing has \nyielded negative results” (Miller et al., 2017) . \nCrowley et al. (2020)  used WES in a single -center cohort study of 1005 pediatric IBD patients and found \na 3% prevalence of damaging variants in genes linked to monogenic IBD, and that 1% of monogenic \npediatric IBD patients have variants in genes associated with primary immunod eficiency that are \npotentially curable through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. As rare genetic variants \ncould manifest in different phenotypes, the researchers believe that the “data supports the diagnosis of \nmonogenic disease beyond th e very early onset IBD population especially in children with a family \nhistory of autoimmune diseases and those with evidence of extra -intestinal manifestations of IBD” and \nthat WES will lend itself to provide definitive and personalized treatments in the future (Crowley et al., \n2020) . \nSrivastava et al. (2014)  conducted a retrospective cohort study on 78 children with neurodevelopmental \ndisabilities and a prior unrevealing workup before WES. The overall presumptive diagnostic testing rate \nwas 41% (32/78 patients). Results of WES affected patient management in a ll cases, most often related \nto reproductive planning (27/78). The investigators concluded that the high diagnostic yield of WES \ncould lead to earlier diagnosis, impacting medical management, prognostication, and family planning \n(Srivastava et al., 2014) . \nHaskell et al. (2018)  studied the diagnostic utility of exome sequencing in the evaluation of \nneuromuscular disorders. A total of 93 undiagnosed patients with potential neuromuscular disorders \nparticipated in this study; the diagnostic yield of these 93 patients with exome seq uencing was 12.9% \n“with one or more pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants identified in a causative gene associated with \nthe patient's disorder” (Haskell et al., 2018) . In this study, exome sequencing was able to provide or \nclarify a neuromuscular disorder diagnosis, but only in a small percentage of the population studied.  \nInvolving WGS or WES as a supplemental level of evaluation has been able to effect change in medical \ncare and treatment pathways. In the NIH -funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, among 382 patients \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 10 of 25 \n \nwith complete evaluations, “28 (21%) of the patients who received a diagnosis, the diagnosis led to a \nrecommendation regarding a change in therapy. In 49 (37%), the diagnosis led to a change in care other \nthan therapy, such as the narrowing of diagnostic t esting. In 48 (36%), the diagnosis led to variant -\nspecific genetic counseling but did not lead to a change in the diagnostic or therapeutic strategy.” The \nchanges in therapy ranged from known drugs, vitamins, coenzyme supplementations, and transplant in \none patient. This demonstrated evidence supporting usage of DNA sequencing for genetically \ndetermined conditions and a representative lens of how it can affect medical care (Splinter et al., 2018) . \nMuthaffar (2021)  conducted a retrospective chart review for WES results between January 2018 to \nNovember 2019 for patients at a pediatric neurology clinic in Saudi Arabia to identify the utility of WES. \nIt was found that “twenty -six children with undiagnosed neurological conditions were identified and \nunderwent WES diagnosis. Nineteen patients (73.0%) of the cohort were diagnosed with pathogenic \nvariants, likely pathogenic variants or variants of unknown significance (VUS).” The researcher also \nfurthered the conclusions of  the WES high diagnostic rate by proving direct implications on clinical \nmanagement based on testing results. One patient who had a positive pathogenic BTD mutation, \ndiagnosed at seven -years old with a biotinidase deficiency, was started on biotin supplements after WES \ntesting, and was able to breathe independently off a ventilator, regain motor capabilities with physical \ntherapy, improve hearing, and elimin ate convulsions (Muthaffar, 2021) . \nUsing WES on eleven probands from ten Jordanian families who have been formerly diagnosed with \nlimb -girdle dystrophy (LGMD) and Charcot -Marie -Tooth disease (CMT), Ababneh et al. (2021)  identified \na series of missense, nonsense, and deletion variants associated with neuromuscular disorders. \nConsequently, the researchers argue that “Utilization of WES is helpful to facilitate rapid and accurate \nNMDs diagnosis, complementing a thorough cli nical evaluation”, especially in a country where the risk \nof autosomal -recessive disorders is increased by consanguinity and the implementation of genetic \ndiagnosis is limited and the results misunderstood (Ababneh et al., 2021) .  \nSanford et al. (2019)  investigated the clinical utility of rWGS in children within the pediatric intensive \ncare unit (PICU). They were able to make a molecular diagnosis by rWGS in 17 of 38 children, and in four \nof the 17 children diagnosed by rWGS (24%), “the genetic diagnose s led to a change in management \nwhile in the PICU, including genome -informed changes in pharmacotherapy and transition to palliative \ncare… Eighty -two percent of diagnoses affected the clinical management of the patient and/or family \nafter PICU discharge, i ncluding avoidance of biopsy, administration of factor replacement, and \nsurveillance for disorder -related sequelae” (Sanford et al., 2019) . In this retrospective analysis, benefits \nof rWGS were further elucidated in the setting of unknown or unclear clinical etiologies.  \nReda et al. (2020)  studied WES for metastatic solid cancer diagnoses in 506 patients. In this study, the \nsomatic and germline exome analysis was restricted to 317 specific genes. Exome sequencing was \nsuccessful in 386 tumor samples, and 342 patients received a therapeutic p roposal based on their \ngenetic results. However, only 79 patients were treated with an NGS matched therapy. While this study \nshows that WES is a possible tool to assist with metastatic solid cancer diagnoses and treatments, “no \ndifferences were observed be tween PFS [progression -free survival] ratios of patients treated with \nmatched therapy versus standard therapy” (Reda et al., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 11 of 25 \n \nOther studies have also yielded bifurcating results on the periodic revisiting of unsolved exome cases \nand for variants of unknown significance. Salfati et al. (2019)  found that re -analysis of 101 WES cases \none to seven  years after initial analysis resulted in “the identification of additional diagnostic variants in \n3 rare disease cases (5.9%) and 1 sudden unexplained death case (2%), which increased our molecular \ndiagnostic yield to 31.4% and 12%, respectively.” However,  though they recognize the importance of \nany diagnostic yield to those families potentially affected, the authors also acknowledge that “most of \nour cases remain unexplained after our re -analysis”, which they attribute to an enduring lack of coverage \nof functional exonic variants, along with “the possibility of complicated oligogenic disease that is not \neasily dissected in small families, and the possibility of disease due to epigenetic, somatic, or other \nuninterrogated genomic aberrations.” As such, “We [ the authors] suggest that a 6 -month cycle of \nautomated re -analysis could improve the pace at which new findings are disseminated to patients. \nPeriodic re -analysis by third party or other software not originally used to analyze cases is also \npotentially use ful to uncover pathogenic variants that may be missed by the differences across genome \ninterpretation platforms” (Salfati et al., 2019) .  \nParent -child Trio Testing  \nParent -child trio testing is a strategy which helps to identify single pathogenic mutations among the \nmany genomic variants in an individual. Specifically, the sequencing of both the parents and the patient \nallows for the variant to be identified easier an d “filtered based on consistency or inconsistency \naccording to the laws of Mendelian inheritance” (Sakai et al., 2013) . \nLee et al. (2014)  reported on the initial clinical indications for clinical exome sequencing (CES) referrals \nand molecular diagnostic rates for different indications and different test types. CES was performed on \n814 patients with undiagnosed, suspected genetic conditions who underwent WES. CES was conducted \nusing a trio -CES technique which involves  both parents and their affected child sequenced \nsimultaneously. Overall, a molecular diagnosis with a causative variant in a well -established clinical gene \nwas provided for 213/ 814 (26%) cases. The trio -CES was associated with a higher molecular diagnostic \nyield (31%; 127/410 cases) than proband -CES or traditional molecular diagnostic methods. The \ninvestigators concluded that “additional studies designed to validate these finding s and to explore the \neffect of this approach on clinical and economic outcomes are warranted” (Lee et al., 2014) . \nSoden et al. (2014)  performed diagnostic WGS and/or WES in parent -child trios for 100 families with 119 \nchildren with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). A total of 45% of the families received molecular \ndiagnoses of an established genetic disorder (53/119 affected children) . An accelerated sequencing \nmodality, rapid WGS, yielded diagnoses in 73% of families with acutely ill children (11/15). In this study, \nWES proved to be less costly than continued conventional diagnostic testing of children with NDD in \nwhom initial testing  failed to yield a diagnosis. The investigators concluded that “initial diagnostic \nevaluation of children with NDD should include trio WGS or WES, with extension of accelerated \nsequencing modalities to high -acuity patients” (Soden et al., 2014) . \nAnother study compared fetal WES versus trio analysis WES on fetuses with sonographic abnormalities. \nThe researchers found that trio analysis yielded a positive/definitive diagnosis in 30% (3/10) of the cases \nas compared to only 14.3% (2/14) of the singlet on cases. They conclude, “In order to expedite \ninterpretation of results, trio sequencing should be employed, but interpretation can still be \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 12 of 25 \n \ncompromised by incomplete coverage of relevant genes” (Drury et al., 2015) . Similarly, these data are \nsupported by another study of trio analysis of thirty different cases. A total of 10% of the cases were \npositive for a pathogenic finding, and 17% were de novo, inherited recessive, or X -linked variants. The \nauthors conclude, “T his study outlines the way for a substantial improvement in the diagnostic yield of \nprenatal genetic abnormalities through the application of next -generation sequencing” (Carss et al., \n2014) . \nYates et al. (2017)  performed WES, including trio analysis, using samples obtained from deceased fetuses \nwith ultrasound anomalies. They note that 20% of cases were positive overall with a definitive diagnosis \nwith another 45% positive for possible pathogenic candidate varia nts. Comparing trio analysis to \nsingleton analysis, 24% (n=11) of trio analysis resulted in a definitive diagnostic finding versus 14% (n=3) \nfor singleton testing (Yates et al., 2017) .  \nClark et al. (2018)  compared the diagnostic and clinical utility of WGS, WES and CMA in children with \nsuspected genetic disorders. Trio analyses were also analyzed. Many studies were reviewed in this meta -\nanalysis; the authors state that “In 37 studies, comprising 20,068 chi ldren, diagnostic utility of WGS \n(0.41, 95% CI 0.34 -0.48, I2 = 44%) and WES (0.36, 95% CI 0.33 -0.40, I2 = 83%) were qualitatively greater \nthan CMA (0.10, 95% CI 0.08 -0.12, I2 = 81%) (Clark et al., 2018) . Further, a statistical difference was not \nfound regarding the diagnostic utility of WES and WGS. Finally, “Subgroups with higher WGS/WES \ndiagnostic utility were trios and those receiving hospital -based interpretation. WGS/WES should be \nconsidered a first -line genomic test for children with suspected genetic diseases” (Clark et al., 2018) . \nZhang et al. (2021)  performed WES and trio analysis on 18 unrelated men who have idiopathic \nhypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), which is a rare genetic disorder that causes delayed or absent \npuberty as well as infertility due to gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) insuffi ciency/deficiency, \nand their parents. With this testing, “one reported and 10 novel variants in eight known IHH causative \ngenes ( AXL, CCDC141, CHD7, DMXL2, FGFR1, PNPLA6, POLR3A, and PROKR2 ), nine variants in nine \nrecently reported candidate genes ( DCAF17,  DCC, EGF, IGSF10, NOTCH1, PDE3A, RELN, SLIT2, and \nTRAPPC9 ), and four variants in four novel candidate genes for IHH ( CCDC88C, CDON, GADL1,  and \nSPRED3 ) were identified in 77.8% (14/18) of IHH cases.” This analysis also supported oligogenic etiology \nfor disease presentation, with 44.4% cases carrying at least two variants in IHH -related genes. They also \nfound that the variants “tended to be maternally in herited (maternal with n = 17 vs paternal with n = 7; \nP = 0.028),” which was confirmed by their previous l iterature review, and due to the presence of female \ncarriers, extends the notion that females may be more tolerant of “deleterious” IHH -related gene \nmutations. This study exemplifies the clinical utility of WES and trio analysis for reproductive genetic \ndisorders and could be used to continue pedigree analyses for IHH (Zhang et al., 2021) . \nMalcher et al. (2022)  investigated the use of whole -genome sequencing in identifying new candidate \ngenes for nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA). The authors applied WGS for 39 patients with NOA to \nidentify novel NOA -associated SNVs, yielding “8 potentially disease causing [sic] variants in 4 genes, \nfollowed by 30 variants in 20 genes that were previously linked to infertility, and 20 variants in 13 genes \nthat have never been investigated with respect to male infertility but could be important in patients \nwith NOA” in 29 of the 3 9 azoospermic individuals. Of these 58 variants, 16 were newly discovered and, \nas such, “highly recommended to examine their possible function and mechanism of participation in \ngametogenesis” (Malcher et al., 2022) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 13 of 25 \n \nIn their examination of whole exome and genome sequencing in a Mendelian disorder cohort, Ewans et \nal. (2022)  determined that “WGS resulted in a diagnosis in one third (34%; 13/38 families) of \nundiagnosed families who had previously had WES.” However, when adjusting for “factors such as \nimprovements to gene -disease knowledge and genomic pipelines through contempo rary WES \nreanalysis, the WGS diagnostic yield reduced to 19% (6/31 remaining families)”, primarily due to “due \nto reduced WES coverage of critical regions that may be solved through an improved WES platform.” \nSuch results contribute to the debate about the  “trade -off between the lower cost of WES and the higher \ndiagnostic yield of WGS” and will ultimately be a function of “the clinical scenario and local resourcing \nand availability” (Ewans et al., 2022) . \nV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \n \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics (ACMG)  \nIn 2012, the ACMG released a policy statement outlining points to consider in the clinical application of \ngenomic sequencing to the detection of germ -line mutations. The ACMG recommended that WGS/WES \nshould be considered in the clinical diagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:  \n• “The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but the phenotype \ndoes not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic test targeting a specific gene is \navailable on a clinical basis.”  \n• “A patient presents with a defined genetic disorder that demonstrates a high degree of genetic \nheterogeneity, making WES or WGS analysis of multiple genes simultaneously a more practical \napproach.”  \n• “A patient presents with a likely genetic disorder, but specific genetic tests available for that \nphenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \n• “A fetus with a likely genetic disorder in which specific genetic tests, including targeted \nsequencing tests, available for that phenotype have failed to arrive at a diagnosis.”  \nACMG stated that “WGS/WES may be considered in preconception carrier screening, using a strategy to \nfocus on genetic variants known to be associated with significant phenotypes in homozygous or \nhemizygous progeny.” ACMG further stated that WGS and WES shou ld not be used at this time as an \napproach to prenatal screening or as a first -tier approach for newborn screening (ACMG, 2012) . \nACMG released a guideline on informed consent for genome/exome sequencing. In that guideline, they \nnoted that WGS/WES was not recommended “before the legal age of majority” unless for “phenotype -\ndriven clinical diagnostic uses or circumstances in which ear ly monitoring or interventions are available \nand effective” (ACMG, 2013) . \nIn 2014 the ACMG published guidelines (Alford et al., 2014)  for the clinical evaluation and etiologic \ndiagnosis of hearing loss which state: “Pretest genetic counseling should be provided, and, with patient's \ninformed consent, genetic testing, if available, should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis —this testing \nmay include single -gene tests, hearing loss  sequencing  panels,  whole -exome  sequencing(WES),  whole -\ngenome  sequencing  (WGS), chromosome analysis, or microarray -based copy -number analysis, \ndepending on clinical findings.”  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 14 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG published guidelines on the use of fetal exome sequencing (ES) in prenatal diagnoses. \nThese guidelines are  below (Monaghan et al., 2020) : \nPretest Considerations  \n• “Exome sequencing may be considered for a fetus with ultrasound anomalies when standard CMA \nand karyotype analysis have failed to yield a definitive diagnosis. If a specific diagnosis is \nsuspected, molecular testing for the suggested disorder (with single -gene test or gene panel) \nshould be the initial test. At the present time, there are no data supporting the clinical use for ES \nfor other reproductive indications, such as the identification of sonographic markers suggestive \nof aneuploidy or a history of re current unexplained pregnancy loss.  \n• Trio analysis consisting of the proband and both biological parents is preferred to singleton (fetus \nonly) or duo (fetus and one parent) analyses. Trio analysis consistently shows higher diagnostic \nyields compared with nontrio analysis. It allows for the i mmediate identification of de novo \nvariants, determination of phase for biallelic variants, and confirmation of carrier status in both \nparents when a homozygous variant is detected. For laboratories not requiring trio analysis for \nprenatal ES, all efforts should be made to determine inheritance of identified fetal variants with \ntargeted testing of the biological parents. There may be circumstances where both biological \nparents are unable to submit specimens. In this scenario, variant segregation testing usi ng the \navailable parent or testing of other closely related family members should be considered.  \n• Pretest counseling is ideally provided by a genetics  professional during which the types of variants \nthat may be returned in a laboratory report for all tested family members would be reviewed.  \nPosttest Considerations  \n• Post -test counseling is recommended, regardless of the test result. It should be provided by \nindividuals with relevant expertise, preferably a genetics professional.  \nReanalysis Considerations  \n• For patients with initial negative ES results, reanalysis of exome sequencing data aids clinical \ndiagnosis after 12 months. This outcome has been validated in the pediatric population as \nadditional phenotypic findings might be noted during a child’s growth  and development. \nContinuous updates in database resources and new publications may provide further information \nfor variant and gene classification.  \n• Due to the discovery of new gene –disease associations (that were unknown at the time of initial \nanalysis), reanalysis can also be considered for diagnostic results and results deemed to be \npossibly (but not definitively) associated with the fetal phenotype . \n• For fetal ES with nondiagnostic or negative results, reanalysis may be considered if a new \nphenotype develops in the proband after birth, a future pregnancy is planned, or a significant \namount of time has passed (either at the discretion of the testing lab oratory or at least 12 months) \nsince the initial testing was performed.  \n• If the original prenatal ES report does not account for the complete phenotype or if \nnew/additional phenotypes develop over time, a reanalysis could be considered” (Monaghan et \nal., 2020) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 15 of 25 \n \nIn 2020 the ACMG conducted a systematic evidence review to support guideline development for the \nuse of exome and genome sequencing among patients with congenital anomalies, developmental delay, \nor intellectual disability (CA/DD/ID). From their review, the  ACMG concluded, “There is evidence that \nES/GS for patients with CA/ DD/ID informs clinical and reproductive decision -making, which could lead \nto improved outcomes for patients and their family members. Further research is needed to generate \nevidence regar ding health outcomes to inform robust guidelines regarding ES/GS in the care of patients \nwith CA/DD/ID” (Malinowski et al., 2020) . \nIn 2021 the ACMG asserted that as the body of literature surrounding this continues to burgeon, it urges \nthem to “strongly recommend ES and GS as a first -tier or second -tier test (guided by clinical judgment \nand often clinician –patient/family shared decisi on making after CMA or focused testing) for patients \nwith one or more CAs prior to one year of age or for patients with DD/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage” (Manickam et al., 2021) .  \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Society for Maternal and Fetal \nMedicine (SFM)  \nIn 2016 the ACOG and SFM published a joint committee opinion on “ Microarrays and Next -Generation \nSequencing Technology: The Use of Advanced Genetic Diagnostic Tools in Obstetrics and Gynecology”, \nwhich states that “the routine use of whole -genome or whole -exome sequencing for prenatal diagnosis \nis not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient peer reviewed data and \nvalidation studies are published” (ACOG & SFM, 2016) .  \nHowever, ACOG and SFM note that WES may be considered when “specific genetic tests available for a \nphenotype, including targeted sequencing tests, have failed to determine a diagnosis in a fetus with \nmultiple congenital anomalies suggestive of a genetic di sorder.” The guideline further clarifies that “in \nselect circumstances (recurrent or lethal fetal anomalies in which other approaches have been \nnoninformative), [WES] may be considered as a diagnostic tool, but only after other appropriate testing \nhas been  noninformative and after extensive counseling by an [OB -GYN[ or other health care provider \nwith genetics expertise who is familiar with these new technologies and their limitations” (ACOG & SFM, \n2016) . This committee opinion was reaffirmed in 2023.  \nJoint Position Statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD), the Society for \nMaternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and the Perinatal Quality Foundation (PQF)  \nPer the guideline, the word “sequencing” is used to refer to “whole exome sequencing, targeted analysis \nusing clinical panels, and whole genome sequencing.”  \n“The use of diagnostic sequencing is currently being introduced for evaluation of fetuses for whom \nstandard diagnostic genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA), has already been \nperformed and is uninformative or is offered concurrentl y according to accepted practice guidelines, or \nfor whom expert genetic opinion determines that standard genetic testing is less optimal than \nsequencing for the presenting fetal phenotype” (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nRoutine use of prenatal sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot be supported due to “insufficient” \nvalidation and data about benefits and pitfalls (ISPD et al., 2018) . \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 16 of 25 \n \nWithin the section on recommendations for all diagnostic applications of genome -wide sequencing, \nconcerning trio analysis, they state, “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio \nanalysis, where fetal and both parental samples are s equenced and analyzed together. The trio approach \ncurrently benefits timeliness of result interpretation and aids assignment of pathogenicity for detected \nsequence variants. If proband‐only sequencing is performed, validation of diagnostic or potentially \ndiagnostic findings best includes a determination of inheritance through targeted testing of samples \nfrom biological parents” (ISPD et al., 2018) . However, the guideline could not recommend one \nsequencing method over another, nor was the guideline certain on the best way to interpret variants \nfound in genome -wide sequencing.  \nThe guideline provides three scenarios in which fetal sequencing may be “beneficial”:  \n“A current pregnancy with a fetus with a single major anomaly or with multiple organ system anomalies \nthat are suggestive of a possible genetic etiology, but no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA; or in \nselect situations with no CMA result, following a multidisciplinary review and consensus, in which there \nis a fetus with a multiple anomaly ‘pattern’ that strongly suggests a single gene disorder.”  \n“A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with a major \nsingle anomaly or multiple anomalies suggestive of a genetic etiology, and a recurrence of similar \nanomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic  diagnosis after karyotype or CMA. In addition, \nwhen such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from the affected \nproband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it is considered appropriate \nto of fer sequencing for both biological parents to look for shared carrier status for autosomal recessive \nmutations that might explain the fetal phenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a \nprevious abnormal fetus or child for exome sequencing is  preferable.”  \n“In families with a history of recurrent stillbirths of unknown etiology after karyotype and/or CMA, \nwhere the fetus in the current pregnancy has a recurrent pattern of anomalies (ISPD et al., 2018) . \nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD)  \nIn 2022, the ISPD released an updated position statement on the use of genome -wide sequencing for \nprenatal diagnosis. Below are the pertinent recommendations:  \n• “Diagnostic sequencing for fetal indications is best done as a trio analysis, where fetal and both \nparental samples are sequenced and analyzed together.”  \n• “Approaches to sequence analysis may vary from examination of genes known to be associated \nwith fetal or neonatal phenotypes to a broader genome -wide strategy. It is also uncertain whether \ninterpretation of variants found by genome -wide sequencing should f ollow the general guidelines \nfor interpretation and reporting of results for children and adults, or whether a more restrictive \napproach, limited to those variants that explain the phenotype is preferable in the prenatal \nsetting, or if a new approach restr icting reporting to severe childhood conditions should be \nconsidered.”  \n• “The current existing data support that prenatal sequencing is beneficial for the following \nindications:  \no A current pregnancy with a fetus having a major single anomaly or multiple organ anomalies:  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 17 of 25 \n \n▪ For which no genetic diagnosis was found after CMA and a clinical genetic expert review \nconsiders the phenotype suggestive of a possible genetic etiology.  \n▪ For which the multiple anomaly “pattern” strongly suggests a single gene disorder with \nno prior genetic testing. As pES is not currently validated to detect all CNVs, CMA should \nbe run before or in parallel with pES in this scenario.  \no A personal (maternal or paternal) history of a prior undiagnosed fetus (or child) affected with \na major single or multiple anomalies:  \n▪ With a recurrence of similar anomalies in the current pregnancy without a genetic \ndiagnosis after karyotype or CMA for the current or prior undiagnosed pregnancy.  \n▪ When such parents present for preconception counseling and no sample is available from \nthe affected proband, or if a fetal sample cannot be obtained in an ongoing pregnancy, it \nis considered appropriate to offer sequencing for both biological parents to lo ok for \nshared carrier status for autosomal recessive mutations that might explain the fetal \nphenotype. However, where possible, obtaining tissue from a previous abnormal fetus or \nchild for pES is preferable.  \n• There is currently no evidence that supports routine testing (including upon parental request) on \nfetal tissue obtained from an invasive prenatal procedure (amniocentesis, CVS, cordocentesis, \nother) for indications other than fetal anomalies  \no There may be special settings when prenatal sequencing in the absence of a fetal phenotype \nvisible on prenatal imaging can be considered, such as with a strong family history of a \nrecurrent childhood‐onset severe genetic condition with no prenatal phenotyp e in previous \nchildren for whom no genetic evaluation was done and is not possible. Such scenarios should \nbe reviewed by an expert multidisciplinary team preferentially in the context of a research \nprotocol. If sequencing is done for this indication, it mu st be done as trio sequencing, using \nan appropriate analytical approach” (Van den Veyver et al., 2022) . \nAmerican Academy of Neurology (AAN) and American Association of Neuromuscular and \nElectrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM)  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Kang et al., 2015)  on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management \nof congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) which state: “In individuals with CMD who either do not have \na mutation identified in one of the commonly associated genes or have a phenotype whose genetic \norigins have n ot been well characterized, physicians might order whole -exome or whole -genome \nsequencing when those technologies become more accessible and affordable for routine clinical use \n(Level C).”  \nThe AAN/AANEM published guidelines (Narayanaswami et al., 2014)  on the diagnosis and treatment of \nlimb -girdle and distal dystrophies which state: “In patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom \ninitial clinically directed genetic testing does not provide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic \nconsultation o r perform parallel  sequencing  of targeted exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -\ngenome screening, or next -generation  sequencing  to identify the genetic abnormality (Level C).”  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology (AMP)  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 18 of 25 \n \nThe AMP published a report on the spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing \nprocedures for inherited conditions and cancer. The background of this report states, “Whole genome \nsequencing is currently more expensive than WES, requires gr eater analysis, and generates more \nvariants of uncertain significance. WES is a plausible approach when the clinical picture cannot be \naffirmed using a specific gene panel. As technologies and understanding of variants advance, whole \ngenome sequencing migh t become the test of choice” (Joseph et al., 2016) . \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)  \nAAP published guidelines on the evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorder. According to the \nguidelines, CMA is recommended if the etiology for developmental disability is not known. Since Fragile \nX Syndrome increases the risk for autism spectrum  disorder, DNA testing for Fragile X should be \nrecommended in all children with ASD, especially for boys and children with a family history of \nintellectual disability. “The cytosine -guanine -guanine trinucleotide repeat expansion that is responsible \nfor fra gile X syndrome is not detected on CMA and must be ordered as a separate test. When the history \nand physical examination, CMA, and fragile X analysis do not identify an etiology, the next step at this \ntime in the etiologic evaluation for [autism spectrum d isorder] is whole -exome sequencing (WES).” AAP \ndoes not recommend the use of commercially marketed tests as they do not provide a molecular \netiologic diagnosis (Hyman et al., 2020) .  \nCanadian College of Medical Geneticists  \nIn 2015, the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists published a position statement on genome -wide \nsequencing for monogenic diseases. Their relevant recommendations include the following:  \n• “Recommendations for diagnostic assessment:  \no Clinical exome sequencing, at this time, should only be used to interrogate the genome for \nnucleotide sequence variants in genes known to cause disease. Clinical WGS may be used to \ndetect CNV and structural variation in addition to sequence variants, thoug h it is not currently \na first -tier test for such analyses.  \no Clinical genome -wide sequencing should be considered in the investigation of an affected \nindividual when his/her phenotype or family history suggests a monogenic aetiology in whom \nthe causal mutation(s) are unknown, and one or more of the following additio nal conditions \napply:  \n▪ the phenotype is associated with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity;  \n▪ specific genetic tests have failed to arrive at a diagnosis and testing of other clinically \nrelevant genes is appropriate;  \n▪ genome -wide sequencing is a more cost -effective approach than available individual gene \nor gene panel testing.”  \n• “Until the benefits of reporting incidental findings are established, we do not endorse the \nintentional clinical analysis of disease -associated genes other than those linked to the primary \nindication.”  \nBelow is a figure of a “decision aid to facilitate the diagnostic evaluation of patients with rare disease of \nsuspected monogenic aetiology” (Boycott et al., 2015) .  \n^\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA.  \n \nM2032 – Whole Genome and Whole Exome Sequencing   Page 19 of 25 \n \n \nThe Royal Australasian College of Physicians  \nIn 2021, the Royal Austalasian  College of Physicians provided guidelines on pediatric genetic testing in \nthe context of intellectual disability (ID) and global developmental delay (GDD). For childhood \nsyndromes or ID/GDD, the group recommends WES or WGS as tests of choice, since they o ffer “a broad, \nagnostic screen,” but acknowledge that WES is more widely available and cost -effective at the time of \npublication. In terms of ordering singleton or trio testing, the group states that “the latter (trio) approach \nis highly recommended given it simplifies analysis… it is also a more streamlined clinical test as trio \ntesting identifies fewer variants of uncertain significance than singleton testing” (Sachdev et al., 2021) . \nVI.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

These tests analyze human chromosomes, deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, \ngenes , and other gene products to detect inheritable and/or acquired alterations that cause or are likely to \ncause a particular disorder or condition. Molecular diagnostic testing is a type of genetic test that examines \nthe changes in one or more genes to determine the order of nucleotides in an individual’s genetic code. \nMolecular tests use DNA sequencing to detect abnormalities  in the gene sequence, to test for \nhistocompatibility antigens, to determine prognosis and/or to predict response  to treatment.  One particular  \nmolecular test, next generation  sequencing (NGS) , uses parallel  sequencing assays to analyze the bulk of an \nindividual’s DNA to detect variants in a broad range of rare and complex disorders. It is often used  when \nsingle gene  or panel  testing  has not provided  a diagnosis  or when  the suspected  condition  or genetic  cause  \nis unclear.  \nGenetic  testing  has demonstrated  efficacy in predicting  outcomes  and to be a helpful  clinical  decision-making \ntool.  It may be used for predictive and pre-symptomatic testing for adult -onset and complex disorders, \ndiagnostic and carrier screening for inherited disorders, and pharmacogenetic testing to guide drug dosage, selection, and response. The likelihood of development  of disease depends on the presence of specific \ngenetic variants, inheritance pattern , penetrance , expressivity , the individual’s age, and other contributory \ngenetic and environmental factors. The different methods to identify specific variants include Sanger sequencing, Microarray technologies , and NGS. Choosing the appropriate test to perform depends on the \nindication or presenting features, tests available for the suspected condition(s), and the available information regarding the genetic causes of the condition or presenting condition(s).  \n \nDEFINITIONS:  \nExpressivity : The clinical  differences in the way a disease  is expressed.  \n \nGene: Refers to a gene, region of a gene, and/or  variants)  of a gene  that can be assayed  serially or in parallel.  \n \nGenetic test : Test that involves an  analysis of human  chromosomes,  deoxynucleic  acid, ribonucleic  acid,  \n\n   \nGenetic and Molecular Testing Medical Necessity Guideline  \n2025  \ngenes, and  gene products (e.g., enzymes, proteins, metabolites) used to detect heritable or somatic variants \nthat are related to disease.  \n \nGenotype : Refers  to the DNA  blueprint  and is associated  with  the clinical  manifestations of a trait  or disease.  \n \nGermline: Refers  to the sex cells  (eggs  and sperm)  that reproducing organisms  use to pass on their  genomes  \nfrom  one generation to the next.  \n \nHigh -risk  group : Refers to  an individual with a personal or  family history of autosomal dominant,  autosomal  \nrecessive,  x- linked recessive, x -linked dominant or a family history of chromosomal abnormality (e.g., \nchromosomal translocation or inversion).  \nInheritance  pattern:  Describe  how  genetic  variants are distributed  in families.  Certain  cancer  syndromes  or \nmetabolic disorders may be autosomal or sex -linked, and recessive or dominant.  \n \nMicroarray technologies : Genetic testing method that uses an allele -specific oligonucleotide hybridization \napproach to code for target reference sequence or alternate, disease -associated variant. The purpose of the \ntest is to identify DNA changes at the level of a single nucleot ide, larger portions of one or more genes, or \nlarger regions of one or more chromosomes.  \nMolecular test : A type of genetic test that looks for changes in one or more genes. These tests determine \nthe order of nucleotides (DNA building blocks) in an individual’s genetic code by DNA sequencing to detect \nvariants in genes and to test for histocompatibility anti gens.  \n \nNext generation sequencing (NGS): Genetic testing method that uses rapid, high -throughput parallel \nsequencing of multiple small fragments of DNA to determine sequence.  \n \nPenetrance : Refers to the likelihood that an individual with a disease genotype will actually manifest one or \nme of the clinical features associated with the disease.  \nSanger  sequencing : Genetic testing method  that is  used to determine the nucleotides  present in a fragment \nof DNA. It is considered the gold standard in clinical genetic testing for the detection of point mutations and \nsmall variants.  \nSomatic  cells : Somatic cells  are diploid  and contain  two sets of chromosomes,  one set inherited  from  each \nparent.  Somatic mutations can  impact the individual carrying the mutation but cannot be passed on and have \nno effect  on the offspring.  \n \nVariant : A variation from a reference sequence for clinical testing. Variants are classified into one of five \ncategories: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of uncertain significance, likely benign, or benign.  \n \n \nDECISION GUIDELINES:  \n\n   \nGenetic and Molecular Testing Medical Necessity Guideline  \n2025 \nCommonwealth Care Alliance (CCA) follows applicable Medicare and Medicaid regulations when available  \nto review prior  authorization  requests  for medical  necessity.

This Medical Necessity \nGuideline (MNG) applies to all CCA Products unless a more expansive and applicable CMS National Coverage \nDeterminations (NCDs), Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs), or state -specific medical necessity guideline exists.  \nMedical Necessity Guidelines are published to provide a better understanding of the basis upon which coverage \ndecisions are made. CCA makes coverage decisions on a case -by-case basis by considering the individual member's \nhealth care needs. If at any time an applicable CMS LCD or NCD or state -specific MNG is more expansive than the criteria \nset forth herein, the NCD, LCD, or state -specific MNG criteria shall supersede these criteria . \nBenefit coverage for health services is determined by the member specific benefit plan document and applicable laws \nthat may require coverage for a specific service. This Medical Necessity Guideline is subject to all applicable Plan Policies  \nand Guidelines , including requirements for prior authorization and other requirements in Provider’s agreement with the \nPlan (including complying with Plan’s Provider Manual specifications).  \nThis Medical Necessity Guideline is not a rigid rule. As with all CCA’s criteria, the fact that a member does not meet these criteria does not, in and of itself, indicate that no coverage can be issued for these services. Providers are advised,  \nhowever, that if they request services for any member who they know does not meet our criteria, the request should be \naccompanied by clear and convincing documentation of medical necessity. The preferred type of documentation is the \nletter of medical necessity, indic ating that a request should be covered either because there is supporting science \nindicating medical necessity (supporting literature (full text preferred) should be attached to the request), or describing the member’s unique clinical circumstances, and describing why this service or supply will be more effective and/or less \ncostly than another service which would otherwise be covered. Note that both supporting scientific evidence and a description of the member’s unique clinical circumstances will generall y be required.  \nRELATED REFERENCES:  \n\n   \nGenetic and Molecular Testing Medical Necessity Guideline  \n2025 \n1.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Seizure \ntypes include generalized seizures (absence seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic \nseizures), focal seizures (simple focal seizures, complex focal seizures, secondary \ngeneralized seizures, among others), and seizures for which the type is unknown. \nEpilepsy syndromes can be associated with generalized, focal, or combined \ngeneralized and focal seizures, and can have onset in childhood or adulthood.2 \nEpilepsy syndromes may be associated with developmental and/or epileptic \nencephalopathy (childhood onset) or progressive neurological deterioration (later \nonset).2 \nCause \nEpilepsy has multiple causes, including central nervous system infection, autoimmune \ndisease, structural brain abnormalities, brain tumors, and head trauma.3 There are also\nnumerous genetic conditions associated with epilepsy. It is estimated that \napproximately 40% of individuals with seizures have an underlying genetic basis for \ntheir condition (see Table 1 for a list of common genetic causes).4 Factors that \ncontribute to the likelihood of a genetic basis includes type of seizures (focal or \ngeneralized) or epilepsy syndromes (such as epileptic encephalopathy), age of onset, \nfamily history, and presence of other clinical features.\nThrough Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based testing, including multi-gene \npanels, whole exome and genome sequencing as well as whole-genome screening for \nCNVs, pathogenic sequence variants have been identified in about 30-40% and \ndeletions or duplications in ~5-10% of patients with a range of epilepsy phenotypes, \nincluding focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsies, epileptic encephalopathies, fever-\nassociated epilepsy syndromes, other epilepsy syndromes, and patients with \nneurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.5,6 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 11 of 20\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Epilepsy                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nThere are many different epilepsy syndromes, including generalized epilepsy \nsyndromes, focal epilepsy syndromes, combined generalized and focal epilepsy \nsyndromes, epilepsy syndromes with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy \n(DEE). These syndromes can present at variable ages ranging from neonatal to \nadulthood.2,7 \nDEE is a group of disorders in which seizures are accompanied by developmental \ndelays, cognitive impairment, or a host of other neurological issues such as feeding \ndifficulties, sleep dysregulation, and behavioral problems.8 Knowledge regarding the \ngenetic basis of these disorders has increased significantly in the last decade due to \nthe advent of high throughput NGS methods, resulting in wider availability of multi-gene\npanel testing. The following are examples of epileptic encephalopathies:\nOhtahara Syndrome (Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy)\no“Characterized by early onset intractable tonic spasms, suppression-burst \npattern on interictal EEG, and poor prognosis.”  9 \no“To date various genes, which have essential roles in the brain’s neuronal and \ninterneuronal functions, have been reported to be associated with Ohtahara \nsyndrome. For instance, syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) regulates synaptic\nvesicle release; aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) acts as a regulator of \nproliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors; solute carrier family 25 \nmember 22 (SLC25A22) encodes a mitochondrial glutamate transporter13; and \npotassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 2 (KCNQ2) plays\na key role in a cell’s ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.”  10 \nDravet Syndrome (Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy)\no“Clinical cardinal features include febrile or afebrile generalized or \nhemiconvulsions starting in the first year of life, seizure evolution to a mixture of \nintractable generalized (myoclonic or atonic seizures, atypical absences) and \nfocal seizures, normal early development, subsequent psychomotor retardation, \nand normal brain imaging at onset.”  9 \no“In most of the cases with Dravet syndrome, one single gene has been involved,\nin contrast to other epileptic encephalopathy syndromes.

Seizure, cognitive, and \npsychiatric phenotypes show heterogeneity. Seizures start from the age of 6 to \n36 months and may be precipitated by fever. Seizure types include GTCS, \nmyoclonic and tonic seizures, absences, and focal.”  9 \no“Different mutations of PCDH19 (protocadherin 19), including missense, \nnonsense, and frameshift mutations, have been reported as the cause of \nEFMR.” 9 \nInheritance \nInheritance patterns differ between various epilepsy syndromes, and include \nmonogenic inheritance patterns such as dominant, X-linked, recessive, and \nmitochondrial, in addition to epilepsy caused by de novo (i.e. new) genetic mutations. \nClinical heterogeneity is also seen in these conditions.\nDiagnosis \nAn electroencephalograph (EEG) can be used to help diagnose epilepsy and possibly \ngive information as to the seizure type. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \nscan can further help define whether epilepsy is caused by a structural brain \nabnormality or help determine the origin of epilepsy. \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is complicated by many factors. Epilepsy syndromes \nfrequently have overlapping features, such as the types of seizures involved and/or \nadditional clinical findings. Many (if not most) epilepsy syndromes, including epileptic \nencephalopathy, are genetically heterogeneous, and can be caused by mutations in a \nnumber of different genes. Sometimes, the inheritance pattern or the presence of \npathognomonic features makes the underlying syndrome clear. However, in many \ncases, it can be difficult to reliably diagnose a genetic epilepsy syndrome based on \nclinical and family history alone.\nNGS-based testing has been shown to dramatically improve the diagnostic rate for \nchildren and adults with epilepsy, as well as significantly shorten the time from \nassessment to diagnosis.11-13 The diagnostic yield of NGS in patients with epilepsy is \nestimated to be 20-40%.6,14,15 \nClinical information (e.g. age of onset, seizure type, EEG results, etc.) or family history \nmay be used in some cases to help narrow down the suspected cause.

Not all \ntreatments will work for everyone and often, it takes multiple treatment trials to find a \nregimen that is successful. Refractory epilepsy is diagnosed after two or more AEDs \nhave failed to control seizures. Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined as \"failure of \nadequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules \n(whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom\".16\nIn a rapidly growing number of epilepsy disorders, knowing the genetic mutation that is \nresponsible for the epilepsy has been shown to help guide management and provide \nmore disease-specific treatment.17,18 \nSurvival \nLifespan is dependent upon seizure control and the underlying cause of the individual's\nepilepsy.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nGenetic testing for epilepsy may consist of next-generation sequencing or multigene \npanels.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nMulti-Gene Testing Panels \nThe efficiency of NGS has led to an increasing number of large, multi-gene testing \npanels. NGS panels that test several genes at once are particularly well-suited to \nconditions caused by more than one gene or where there is considerable clinical \noverlap between conditions making it difficult to reliably narrow down likely causes. \nAdditionally, tests should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of identifying mutations \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

In this age period, the diagnostic yield of \ngenetic testing may reach up to 60%. However, age at testing (as opposed to the \nage at onset of epilepsy) should not influence the decision to test or the type of test \nchosen. Individuals who are now adults who had early-onset epilepsy likely \npresented in the era before genetic testing was widely available, and should be \nconsidered candidates for testing.\" \n\"Clinical utility of genetic testing is highest in the more severe, drug-resistant \nepilepsies . Overall, the most obvious indication, in terms of clinical utility and \ndiagnostic yield, is for people with early-onset DEE or neurodevelopmental \ndisorders with epilepsy.

We conditionally recommend ES/GS over MGP as the first-tier test.\"\n\"The MGP panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and include copy number \nanalysis.\"\n\"MGPs are valuable clinical tools that can be employed in a number of clinical \nscenarios, for example, when an individual presents with a defined epilepsy \nsyndrome for which a subset of genes should be interrogated more robustly than \nthrough ES when GS is unavailable. Additionally, if urgent results are required and \nrapid ES/GS is unavailable, a targeted MGP may be considered. MGPs may also \nbe utilized as a first-tier test when access to ES/GS, or the additional genetic \ncounseling required to implement such testing, may be limited.\"\nSelected Relevant Publications \nPeer reviewed and expert authored articles are presented below. \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic testing for epileptic encephalopathy \nstated the following: \no“Second line investigations: Targeted next generation sequencing panels of \nepileptic encephalopathy genes for individuals with epileptic encephalopathy.”  8 \nIn 2016, a peer reviewed article on genetic causes of early-onset epileptic \nencephalopathy stated the following:10 \no“Molecular-based studies on early-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be \nperformed, necessitating programmed genetical algorithms. If the phenotype \ncould be determined with clinical findings, specific gene testing would be helpful \nin diagnosis. However, if the phenotype could not be determined because of \noverlapping phenotypes of different syndromes and the spectrum of phenotypes\nseen in different mutations, the use of gene panels for epilepsy would increase \nthe probability of correct diagnosis. In a recent study, the rate of diagnosis with \ntargeted single gene sequencing has been reported as 15.4%, whereas the rate\nhas increased to 46.2% with the utility of epilepsy gene panels.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family .

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

There are a variety of causes of DCM, including genetic and nongenetic conditions. Genetic forms of DCM are heterogeneous in their\nmolecular basis and clinical expression. Genetic testing for DCM has potential utility for confirming a diagnosis of genetic DCM and as a prognostic test\nin family members when familial DCM is present.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to examine whether genetic testing improves net health outcomes in individuals with suspected dilated\ncardiomyopathy and in asymptomatic individuals who have a relative with dilated cardiomyopathy and a known familial variant.\n \nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nComprehensive genetic testing for individuals with signs or symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy , which is considered idiopathic after a negative\nworkup for secondary causes, is considered medically necessary .\nTargeted genetic testing for asymptomatic individuals with a first-degree relative who has dilated cardiomyopathy and a known familial variant is\nconsidered medically necessary .\nGenetic testing for dilated cardiomyopathy is considered investigational  in all other situations.FEP 2.04.1 14 Genetic Testing for Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\n \nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nStandard W orkup for Patients W ith Signs or Symptoms of Dilated Cardiomyopathy\nThe standard workup for patients with signs or symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) includes a clinical exam, blood pressure monitoring,\nelectrocardiography , echocardiography , and workup for coronary artery disease as warranted by risk factors. An extensive workup including cardiac\nmagnetic resonance imaging, exercise testing, right-sided catheterization with biopsy , and 24-hour electrocardiography monitoring will uncover only a\nsmall number of additional etiologies for DCM.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It was implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (T able PG1). The Society's nomenclature is\nrecommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human  Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology<97>\"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign”<97>to describe\nvariants identified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1. Nomenclature to Report on V ariants Found in DNA\nPrevious Updated Definition\nMutation Disease-associated\nvariantDisease-associated change in the DNA  sequence\n Variant Change in the DNA  sequence\n Familial variant Disease-associated variant identified in a proband for use in subsequent targeted genetic testing in first-\ndegree relatives\nTable PG2.

They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nGenetic Counseling\nGenetic counseling is primarily aimed at patients who are at risk for inherited disorders, and experts recommend formal genetic counseling in most\ncases when genetic testing for an inherited condition is considered. The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient's existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\n \nFDA REGULA TORY STATUS\nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the\ngeneral regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be\nlicensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this\ntest.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who have signs and/or symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) who receive comprehensive genetic testing, the evidence includes\nlarge case series reporting clinical validity and prospective observational studies reporting clinical utility . Relevant outcomes are overall survival, test\nvalidity , symptoms, change in disease status, functional outcomes, quality of life, and treatment-related morbidity . The percentage of patients with\nidiopathic DCM who have a genetic variant (clinical sensitivity) is relatively low , in the range of 10% to 40%. Additional studies assessed clinical\noutcomes of patients with DCM and at least 1 known variant compared with patients with DCM and no known variants. The studies reported that\npatients with DCM and known variants experienced lower event-free survival, earlier onset of symptoms, lower transplant-free survival, and more life-\nthreatening arrhythmias compared with patients with DCM and no known variants. A prospective observational study has reported that patients with\nDCM and known variants experienced high rates of morbidity and mortality during 4 to 8 years of follow-up. While direct evidence of clinical usefulness\nis lacking, confirming a diagnosis can lead to changes in clinical management, which improve net health outcomes. Changes in management may\ninclude earlier implantation of cardiac defibrillators or increased surveillance to detect worsening of symptoms, as well as cascade genetic testing of\nasymptomatic family members. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are asymptomatic with a first-degree relative who has DCM and a known familial variant who receive targeted genetic testing for a\nknown familial variant, the evidence includes retrospective studies and case series reporting clinical value and a prospective observational study\nreporting clinical utility . Relevant outcomes are test validity , symptoms, morbid events, functional outcomes, quality of life, and treatment-related\nmorbidity . For an individual at-risk due to genetic DCM in the family , genetic testing can identify whether a familial variant has been inherited. A\nprospective observational study with 4 to 8 years of follow-up reported the development of cardiac symptoms among patients initially asymptomatic\nwho had DCM-related variants. While direct evidence of clinical usefulness is lacking, confirming a diagnosis can lead to changes in clinical\nmanagement, which improve net health outcomes. Changes in management may include periodic clinical and cardiovascular evaluations to detect the\nearliest signs of disease, as well as genetic counseling. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.FEP 2.04.1 14 Genetic Testing for Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Whole exome sequencing and WGS have been proposed  for use in patients presenting\nwith disorders and anomalies not explained by a standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a\nbroad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether whole exome or whole genome sequencing improves the net health outcome in\nindividuals with suspected genetic disorders.\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

The majority of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated \nwith three common founder mutations, two of which are in the BRCA1 gene and \none in the BRCA2 gene.1,3,4 These three mutations account for up to 99% of \nidentified mutations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.1 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

When a parent has a mutation, each \noffspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation. Males and females are equally \nlikely to be affected.\nBRCA2 mutations inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (mutations in both \ncopies of the gene) cause Fanconi Anemia. BRCA1 mutations inherited in an \nautosomal recessive manner usually end in miscarriage, however, rare reports of \nindividuals with Fanconi Anemia due to biallelic mutations in BRCA1 have been \nreported. For more information on testing for Fanconi Anemia, please refer to the \nguideline Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) Testing , as this testing \nis not addressed here.\nDiagnosis \nThe diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene \nassociated with HBOC.\nManagement \nScreening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased \nrisk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA mutation.1 \nSpecial Considerations \nOther inherited cancer syndromes that can include breast cancer are Li-Fraumeni \nsyndrome10417 (TP53), Cowden syndrome10192 (PTEN), Hereditary Diffuse Gastric \nCancer10317 (CDH1), and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome10643 (STK11). Additionally, other\ngenes that can increase the risk for breast cancer are ATM, BARD1, CHEK2, NF1, and\nPALB210690.1,3,8,9 \nTest information \nIntroduction\nBRCA testing may include known familial mutation analysis, Ashkenazi Jewish founder \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nThis test is appropriate for those who have a known BRCA mutation in the family and \nare not Ashkenazi Jewish.3,4 \nAshkenazi Jewish Founder Mutation Testing \nAshkenazi Jewish founder mutation testing includes the three mutations most \ncommonly found in the Ashkenazi Jewish population:\n185delAG and 5382insC in BRCA1, and\n6174delT in BRCA2\nTesting for these mutations detects up to 99% of mutations in those with Ashkenazi \nJewish ancestry.\nFounder mutation testing may be appropriate for those with Ashkenazi Jewish \nancestry, even with a known familial mutation, since these mutations are common \nenough that multiple mutations can be found in the same Ashkenazi Jewish individual \nor family. If the familial mutation is not one of the three Ashkenazi Jewish mutations, \nthe known familial mutation analysis for that mutation should be performed in addition \nto the founder mutation panel.1,3 \nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis. These assays detect gains and losses too large to be \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Currently, there is insufficient \nevidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in combination with \nmulti-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”  \nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons \nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS, 2019) published a consensus \nguideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. They stated the following:12 \n\"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals \nknowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and counseling and \nmake recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange \ntesting. When the patient’s history and/or test results are complex, referral to a \ncertified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing \nis increasingly provided through multi-gene panels. There are a wide variety of \npanels available, with different genes on different panels. There is a lack of \nconsensus among experts regarding which genes should be tested in different \nclinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the \nunderstanding of risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some \ngenes.\" \n\"Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal history of \nbreast cancer. Recent data support that genetic testing should be offered to each \npatient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or with a personal history). If genetic \ntesting is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and PALB2, with \nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and family history. For patients \nwith newly diagnosed breast cancer, identification of a mutation may impact local \ntreatment recommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic \ntherapy. Additionally, family members may subsequently be offered testing and \ntailored risk reduction strategies.\" \n\"Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. \nEvery patient being seen by a breast surgeon, who had genetic testing in the past \nand no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated \ntesting considered. In particular, a patient who had negative germline BRCA1 and 2\ntesting, who is from a family with no pathogenic variants, should be considered for \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Unaffected patients should be informed that \ntesting an affected relative first, whenever possible, is more informative than \nundergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the affected relative \nfirst, then the unaffected family member should be considered for testing if they are \ninterested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of \n“uninformative negative” results.

The USPSTF guideline recommended:10\nWhen a woman's personal or family history of cancer is consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family \nhistory of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry \nassociated with breast cancer susceptibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) gene mutations with\nan appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. Women with a positive result on \nthe risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after \ncounseling, genetic testing.”  (Evidence grade: B)\nWhen a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 \nmutation: “recommends against routine risk assessment, genetic counseling, or \ngenetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not \nassociated with potentially harmful BRCA1/2  gene mutations.” (Evidence grade: D)\n\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that\nbegins with identifying patients with family or personal histories of breast, ovarian, \ntubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 \nmutations; or ancestry associated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for \nclinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic \ncounseling by suitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of \nselected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results.”\n\"The type of mutation analysis required depends on family history. Individuals from \nfamilies with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain mutations \nare more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for \nthese specific mutations.\"\nNote  This benefit/harm statement only applies to those jurisdictions that do not have \nMedicare guidance. Based upon the guidelines and evidence provided in the clinical \npolicy, following EviCore's criteria for BRCA analysis will ensure that testing will be \navailable to those members most likely to benefit from a genetic diagnosis. For those \nnot meeting criteria, it ensures alternate diagnostic strategies are considered. \nHowever, it is possible that some members who have the condition, but have non-\nstandard features, will not receive an immediate approval for testing.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Policy Description  \nGermline variants or mutations are defined as genetic alteration s that occur within the germ cells (egg \nor sperm), such that the alteration becomes incorporated into the DNA of every cell in the body of the \noffspring. It may a lso be called hereditary mutation.   \n Genetic testing refers to the use of technologies that identify genetic variation, which include genomic, \ntranscriptional, proteomic, and epigenetic alterations, for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease.  \nII. Indications and/or Limitations of Coverage \nApplication of coverage criteria is dependent upon an individual’s benefit coverage at the time of the \nrequest. Specifications pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid can be found in Section V III of this policy \ndocument.  \n1) Genetic counseling MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA AND IS REQUIRED  (IF TESTING IS NOT BEING \nORDERED BY A SPECIALIST IN THE DISEASE PROCESS IN QUESTION (e.g. endocrinologist and maturity onset diabetes of youth gene evaluation)) for individuals prior to and after undergoing genetic testing for diagnostic, carrier, and/or risk assessment purposes.  \n2) Genetic testing of the individual's genome for inherited diseases MEETS COVERAGE CRITERIA , once \nper patient lifetime, when the following criteria are met:  \na) The individual for whom the test is requested is either:  \ni) Is currently symptomatic with suspicion of a known genetic disease where knowledge of mutation will assist in diagnosis, treatment, or procreative management, OR  \nii) Is currently asymptomatic but is judged to be at significant risk for an inherited disorder or \ncancer risk factor based on family history and/or ethnicity, AND , if being tested for risk of \nan adult -onset condition  is at or above the age of majority, (e.g., 18 years), unless there is \ndocumented evidence that early intervention during childhood may prevent disease \nseverity or time of disease onset, OR  \niii) Is asymptomatic but judged to be at risk as a carrier of an inherited disorder or cancer risk factor based on family history and/or ethnicity AND  would benefit from procreative \nmanagement  \nb) Regarding the test being considered ALL  the following are MET:  \ni) Scientific literature shows association of specific a gene mutation (or mutations) is associated with the disease in question and is clinically actionable (there is clinical utility) with non -investigational treatment; AND  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 2 of 10 \nii) Other testing for the disease is equivocal or does not exist and confirmation of gene \nmutation is standard of care for the disease state; AND  \niii) Disease in question is associated with significant morbidity and/or mortality; AND  \niv) Results of testing can impact clinical management via surveillance or treatment strategies \nand will guide decisions on healthcare management to mitigate symptoms or progression \nof the disorder.  \n3) Germline multi- gene panel testing (See Note 1), defined as multiple gene tests for a medical \ncondition or symptoms/non- specific presentation run on one testing platform, MEETS COVERAGE \nCRITERIA  according to the guidelines in the preceding coverage criteria and the reimbursement \nlimitations (see section regarding Reimbursement below).  \nThe following does not meet coverage criteria due to a lack of available published scientific literature \nconfirming that the test(s) is/are required and beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment of a patient’s \nillness. \n4) Genetic testing of an individual’s genome for inherited diseases DOES NOT MEET COVERAGE \nCRITERIA in the following situations:   \na) For risk assessment of an individual’s genome when the criteria defined in the  “MEETS \nCOVERAGE CRIERIA”  criteria above are not met  \nb) For inherited disease diagnosis or carrier assessment using panels of genes that include genes \noutside of those specifically related to the disease being investigated  \nc) Repeat germline testing of a unique gene using the identical method of gene analysis  \nd) Testing as a screening tool in the general population  \ne) Direct -to-consumer genetic testing (e.g. mail order, online ordering, pharmacy, retail)  \nNote 1:  For references regarding the clinical application of genomic sequencing and for appropriate medical coding, please refer to . \nIII. Reimbursement  \n1. If a procedure code is available for the multi- gene panel test, then this code is to be utilized ( i.e. \n81442 Noonan spectrum disorders genomic sequence analysis panel).  \n2. If there is not a specific next generation sequencing procedure code that represents the requested \ntest, the procedure may be represented by  a maximum of ONE  unit of 81479 [unlisted molecular \npathology procedure ] (i.e. 81479 X 1 should account for all remaining gene testing)  OR All genes \ntested on the panel must be represented by ALL appropriate Molecular Pathology Tier 1 or 2 procedure codes (with exception of 81479 x 1 only being listed once if it appropriately represents \nmore than one gene in the panel)  \n3.

Scientific Background  \nGene  mutations  are referred  to as “germline”  if they  are within gametes  (ova  and sperm) . Therefore,  \nthese  mutations  may  be passed  on from  parent  to offspring.  There  are many  different  types  of germline  \nmutations,  such as single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs),  structural  variations  such  as deletions,  \ninversions,  or translocations,  as well as smaller  chromosomal  abnormalities  such as short  tandem  repeats,  \nor gene  fusions. M utations  may  not necessarily  result  in disease.  \nSNPs  are the most  common  type  of genetic  mutation,  such  as missense  mutations.  These mutations  are \nsingle  base -pair changes  where  one nucleotide  is replaced  with  a different  nucleotide . Millions  of \nindividual  SNPs  have  been  identified  through  genome -wide  association  studies,  with  approximately  4000  \nSNPs  with  potential  association  with  disease . Insertion/deletion  (indel)  polymorphisms  are often  a single  \nnucleotide  but may  be up to four nucleotides.  SNPs  often  lead  to frameshift  mutations,  which  can cause  \npremature  stop  codons  and the failure  of the allele . \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 4 of 10 \nStructural variations  are usually  classified  as larger than  1000 base  pairs. These  include  deletions,  \nduplications,  inversions,  translocations,  or ring chromosome  formation.  Due to the large  number  of bases  \naffected,  these  variations  may  lead  to severe  genetic  abnormalities.  For example,  a major cause  of \nDuchenne  muscular  dystrophy  is the deletion  of large  portions  of exons  (coding  portions  of genes) . The \nmost  common  structural  variation  is the copy  number  variant  (CNV),  which  refers  to differing  amounts  of \nDNA  segments  in different  individuals.  For example,  one person  may  have  three  copies  of a specific  \nsegment  whereas  another  may  only  have  two.  These variations  may  lead  to dysregulation,  gain-of-\nfunction,  or loss-of-function  of the affected  genes.  The sensitive  genes  that require  or produce  precise  \namounts  of a protein  product  tend  to suffer more  from  these  variations. \nGermline  mutations  are unique  in that the risk for certain  conditions , including  many  forms  of cancer , \nmay  be passed  from  parent  to offspring. Testing  for these conditions  will often  involve  testing  entire  \nfamilies  if one member  is found to have  a germline  mutation ; for example,  the National Comprehensive  \nCancer  Network  (NCCN ) guidelines  for hereditary  cancer  recommend  testing  for BRCA 1/2, CDH1,  PALB2,  \nPTEN  and TP53  mutations  if any blood  relative  has a known or likely  pathogenic  variant  in a cancer  \nsusceptibility  gene . Wilson  e t  al. (2020)  estimate  that 21,800 adult  survivors  of childhood  cancer in the \nUnited  States  carry  a pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variant  in one of 156 cancer  predisposition  genes.  \n \nOther  types  of mutations  are unique  to germline  mutations.  Errors  in chromosome  number  (aneuploidy)  \nare typically  caused  by non- disjunctions  in meiosis, causing  either  a monosomic  (one  chromosome)  or a \ntrisomic  (three  chromosomes)  set of chromosomes.  Some  aneuploidies , trisomy  21, or Down  Syndrome , \nbeing  most  notable , are compatible  with  life. Aneuploidies  may  also result  with  sex chromosomes,  \nresulting  in conditions  such as Turner’s  Syndrome  (one  X chromosome)  or Klinefelter’s  Syndrome  (XXY).  \nAny size mutation  may  be pathogenic  and must  be classified  as to how  likely  they  are to cause  disease. \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  (ACMG ) has classified  mutations  in five \ncategories,  which  are as follows:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  uncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and \nbenign.  The “likely  pathogenic”  and “likely  benign”  refer to weaker  evidence  than  their  respective  \npathogenic  and benign categories,  and “uncertain  significance”  refers  to evidence  that does  not meet  \ncriteri a for benignity  or pathogenicity  or has conflicting  evidence  from  both  sides.  Prediction  algorithms  \nhave  been used to interpret  variants  and to predict  whether  a variant  will affect  the gene  function or \nsplicing  of the gene.  These  algorithms  are publicly  available  but have  a tendency  of predicting  harmful \nimpact  of a variant.  The specificity  of these  databases  has been estimated  at 60-80%.  \nDue to t he  enormous  number  of variants,  as well as the rate that variants  are discovered,  comprehensive  \ndatabases  of genetic  variants  have  been published and are easily  available. For example,  the Haplotype  \nReference  Consortium  contains  over  40 million  identified  SNPs . Databases  focusing on cancer -specific  \nvariants,  reference  sequences , and the general  population  are all available  publicly.   \nFor many  years,  single -gene  testing  was the standard  approach  for germline  mutation  testing.  In recent  \nyears,  multigene  panel  testing  (MGPT)  has been introduced and widely  accepted  as the first-tier test.  \nMGPT  increases  the probability  of identifying  pathogenic  mutations  and represents  an affordable  \napplication  of next -generation sequencing  (NGS)  into clinical practice.  However,  the clinical utility  of \nMGPT  is not well established,  especially  in cases  where  more  than  one pathogenic  variant  is identified.  \nThe risk for a specific  malignancy  is complex  and if a gene  panel  discovers  a mutation  incidentally,  \nmanagement  can be difficult.  Many  guidelines  call for radical  procedures  for these  disease  states  and it \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 5 of 10 \nmay  cause  unnecessary  harm  for the patient  concerned  about  predisposition  to the disease.  Additionally,  \na combination  of mutations  may  interact  to alter the profile  of the disease. For instance,  certain  \ncombinations  of mutations  may  be detrimental and increase  the overall  risk of cancer  malignancy,  while  \nother  combinations  may  reduce  overall  risk of malignancy.  In this regard,  identifying  clinically  actionable  \nmutations  may  be unclear  with  MGPT.   \nClinical  Utility  and Validity  \nGenetic  testing  for germline  mutations  “can be conducted  on virtually  any tissue  type, ” although  many  \nlaboratories  prefer blood  samples,  check  swabs  or saliva  samples.  Advancements  in technology  and \navailability  of sequencing,  previously  constrained by limitations  of sequential  single -gene  testing  on \nlimited  patient  samples,  have  led to significant  strides  in the understanding  of the genetic  basis  of \ninherited  and somatic  conditions.   \nVariants  detected  by genetic  testing  include  inherited  germline  variants  and somatic  mutations ; next  \ngeneration  sequencing (NGS)  has allowed  for superior  detection  for these  mutations.  The accuracy  of \nNGS  varies  depending on how  many  genes  are sequenced;  fewer  genes  tend  to result  in higher  accuracy  \nsince  there  will be more  “probe -template  overlap .” Although Sanger  sequencing  remains  the most  \naccurate  at >99.99%  accuracy,  it cannot  sequence  a large  quantity  of genes  in a timely  fashion  and is best  \nused  for sequencing  of a specific  gene.  Pogoda  et al. (2019)  identified  rare variants  in the ATM  gene by \nusing single molecule Molecular Inversion Probes (smMIPSs) , an NGS -based screening method . A total \nof 373 patients with dystonia and six positive controls with previously identified ATM  variants \nparticipated in this study. Results generated by the smMIPs  “produced similar results as routinely used \nNGS -based approaches ” (Pogoda et al., 2019) . This suggests that ATM  screening should be routinely \nused when genetic testing dystonia patients.  Further, smMIPs may be an important technique for the \ngermline screening for all rare neurodegenerative disorders.  \nThe c linical  validity  of a genetic  test depends  primarily  on the expressivity  and penetrance  of a given  \nphenotype.  Penetrance  refers  to the likelihood  of developing  a disease  when the pathogenic  mutation  is \npresent,  and expressivity  refers  to the variations  in the way the disease  is expressed.  For example,  \nvirtually  any mutation  in the APC gene  will cause  symptoms  of familial  adenomatous  polyposis,  thereby  \nincreasing  the clinical  validity  of an APC assessment  while  other  conditions  may  not clinically  manifest  at \nall despite  a mutated  genotype.   \nThe clinical  utility  of a genetic  test generally  relies  on available  treatments  for a condition.  Conditions  \nsuch  as Huntington Disease  that do not have  many  options  for treatment  will have  limited  clinical utility  \ncompared to another  condition  even  though the actual test is highly  valid.  Factors , such  as severity of the \ndisease  and management  options , affect  the clinical  utility  of a genetic  test.   \nLincoln  et al. (2020)  performed  a retrospective study  to investigate the yield  and utility  of germline  \ntesting  on cancer  patients  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing.  The authors  calculated  the prevalence  of \npathogenic  germline  variants  (PVG)  and the potential  actionability  of the PVGs  in 2023  cancer  patients . \n30.5%  (n=617)  of participants  had PVGs . Participants  with  PVGs  spanned  all ages  and cancer  types.  \nTumor  DNA  sequencing missed 8.1%  of PGVs . 11.2%  of missed  PVGs  were  only  detected  after \ndeveloping a second  primary  cancer.  The results  suggest  that missed PVGs  could  have  been  detected  \nearlier and the second  cancer  could  have  been  treated  earlier or prevented.  The authors  concluded  \nthat germline  testing  following  tumor  DNA  sequencing can result  in important  findings  that can impact  \npatient  care.  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 6 of 10 \nVI. Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular \nPathology  (AMP)   \nThe ACMG and AMP released criteria on the types and severity of mutations, which are as follows:  \n• Very strong evidence of pathogenicity : Null variants (nonsense, frameshifts, canonical +/ - 1-2 splice \nsites, initiation codon, exon deletions) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease. The guidelines note to use caution in genes where LOF is not a mechanism, if L OF variants \nare at the 3’ end, if exon skipping occurs, and if multiple transcripts are present.  \n• Strong: Amino acid change to a pathogenic version, de novo mutations, established studies \nsupporting a damaging gene or gene product, or if the prevalence of the variant is increased in affected individuals compared to healthy controls. The guidelines note to be careful of changes \nimpacting splicing and if only the paternity has been confirmed.  \n• Moderate: Located in a mutational hot spot or well- established functional domain (e.g., active site \nof an enzyme) without a benign variation, absent from controls in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium, detected in trans  with pathogenic variants for \na recessive disorder, protein length changes, novel missense changes where a different missense \nchange has been pathogenic before, and a possible de novo mutation.  \n• Supporting: Co -segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively \nknown to cause the disease, missense variant in a gene with low rate of benign missense variation, \nif the mutation has evidence that it is deleterious, or if the patient’s phenotype is highly specific for \ndisease with a single genetic cause.  \nThe guidelines also list criteria for benign gene variants.  \n• Stand- alone evidence of benignity: Allele frequency is >5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 \nGenomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium  \n• Strong: Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder, observed in healthy adult with full \npenetrance at early age, lack of segregation in affected family members (although pathogenic variants may masquerade as nonsegregated), or well -established studies that show no damaging \neffect on protein production.  \n• Supporting: Missense variant of a gene for which truncating mutations are pathogenic, indels in \nrepetitive region of unknown function, silent variants, variants of unknown significance, or a trans  \nversion of a cis mutation.  \nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network  (NCCN)   \nMultiple germline  mutations have been incorporated into the diagnostic workups recommended by the \nNCCN. Furthermore, the NCCN has several guidelines which recommend that gene expression profiling, or multiple gene testing, may be helpful, more efficient and/or cost -effecti ve for selected patients. \nPlease see the individual policies.  \nAssociation for Molecular Pathology  (AMP) , American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) , and College \nof American Pathologists ( CAP)  \n^\n\n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA . \nM2145  General Genetic Testing Germline Disorders    Page 7 of 10 \nThe Joint Commission noted that germline variants should focus on the pathogenicity of a given variant \nrather than their impact on clinical care. The guidelines recommend reporting germline variants with known clinical impact , such as BRCA1  or 2. A genetic counseling recommendation should also be \nprovided if a pathogenic germline mutation is found.  \nThe guidelines note that it is critical to identify a somatic vs a germline mutation as the type of mutation \nmay have significant clinical consequences . \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology  (ASCO)   \nThe ASCO published guidelines regarding genetic and genomic testing for cancer susceptibility. These guidelines state that  the “ASCO recognizes that concurrent multigene testing (ie, panel testing) may be \nefficient in circumstances that require evaluation of multiple high -penetrance genes of established \nclinical utility as possible explanations for a patient’s personal or family history of cancer. Depending on the specific genes included on the panel employed, panel testing may also identify mutations in genes associat ed with moderate or low cancer risks and mutations in high -penetrance genes that would not \nhave been evaluated on  the basis of the presenting personal or family history… ASCO affirms that it is \nsufficient for cancer risk assessment to evaluate genes of established clinical utility that are suggested by the patient’s personal and/or family history .” \nASCO released guidelines regarding germline testing for ovarian  cancer. ASCO recommends that “ all \nwomen diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer should be offered germline genetic testing for BRCA1, \nBRCA2 , and other ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, irrespective of their clinical features or family \ncancer history. In addition, “first - or second -degree blood relatives of a patient with ovarian cancer with \na known germline pathogenic cancer susceptibility  gene mutation or variant should be offered \nindividualized genetic risk evaluation, counseling, and genetic testing.” Lastly, “ clinical decisions should \nnot be based on a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).” In this case, the patient’s clinical features and family history should be taken into consideration and should inform clinical decision making.  \nVII.

It is a heterogeneous condition that encompasses many types of seizures and varies in\nage of onset and severity . Many genetic epilepsies are thought to have a complex, multifactorial genetic basis. There are also numerous rare epileptic\nsyndromes associated with global developmental delay and/or cognitive impairment that occur in infancy or early childhood, and that may be caused\nby a single-gene pathogenic variant . Genetic testing is commercially available for a large number of genes that may be related to epilepsy .\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to determine whether genetic testing improves the net health outcome in individuals with infantile- or early-\nchildhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy or with presumed genetic epilepsy .\n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nGenetic testing for genes associated with infantile- and early-childhood onset epilepsy syndromes in individuals with infantile- and early-childhood-\nonset epilepsy syndromes in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (see Policy Guidelines section) may be considered medically necessary  if\npositive test results may:\nLead to changes in medication management; AND/OR\nLead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests are avoided ; AND/OR\nLead to changes in reproductive decision making.\nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other situations.\nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nPolicy Scope\nIncluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that might have a genetic etiology . In 2010, the International League Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as\nhaving underlying genetic cause or etiology when, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic defect and\nseizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or metabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy . The updated 2017 ILAE\nclassification system does not discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause.\nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom ( eg,\nDravet syndrome, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy , generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and intellectual disability limited to\nfemales, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy). Other clinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes  but are generally  secondary to epilepsy\nitself.\nExcluded T ests and Conditions\nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of symptomatology , of which seizures may be one, such as the\nneurocutaneous disorders ( eg, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral malformations or abnormal\ncortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. Genetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed  in other evidence\nreviews (see Related Policies links).\nTesting that is limited to genotyping of cytochrome P450 ( CYP450)  genes is addressed  separately (evidence review 2.04.38).\nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry prior to  considering drug treatment\nwith carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nlabeling for carbamazepine.\nThis policy also does not address the testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA  polymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically\nsuspected mitochondrial disorders prior to  initiation of therapy with valproate. V alproate\"s label contains a black box warning related to increased risk of\nacute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients with POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA  labeling states\nthat valproate \" is contraindicated  in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under 2 years of age who\nare clinically suspected  of having a POLG-related disorder”.\nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and T esting Strategy\nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early childhood, are severe, and are characterized by\nepilepsy as the primary manifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League Against\nEpilepsy , these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndromes associated with a high probability of encephalopathic features\nthat present or worsen after the onset of epilepsy . Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or  intellectual disability , may be\npresent secondary to the epilepsy  itself. Specific clinical syndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include:FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers.

Some of them are summarized  in Table PG1.\nTable PG1.

There is a challenge in defining the population appropriate for testing given that specific epileptic\nsyndromes may be associated  with dif ferent EEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe seizures prior to\nthe onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However , for this policy , the medically necessary policy statement would apply for\npatients with :\nOnset of seizures in early childhood (ie, before the age of 5 years); AND\nClinically severe seizures that af fect daily functioning and/or  interictal EEG abnormalities; AND\nNo other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient\"s symptoms.\n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nTesting Strategy\nThere is clinical and genetic overlap for many of the electroclinical syndromes previously discussed. If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based\non history , EEG findings, and other test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most likely to be involved,\nfollowed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular , if an SCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+),\nmolecular genetic testing of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by deletion and duplication analysis if a pathogenic\nvariant is not identified , should be obtained.\nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses a multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In\nthese cases, panels should meet the criteria outlined in evidence review 2.04.92 (general approach to evaluating the utility of genetic panels). Criteria\nfor use of  whole exome sequencing are outlined  in evidence review 2.04.102 (whole exome and whole genome sequencing for diagnosis of genetic\ndisorders).\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (T able PG2). The Society\"s\nnomenclature is recommended  by the Human V ariome Project, the Human  Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology<97>\"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign”<97>to describe\nvariants identified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG2.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nGenetic Counseling\nGenetic counseling is primarily aimed at patients who are at risk for inherited disorders, and experts recommend formal genetic counseling in most\ncases when genetic testing for an inherited condition is considered. The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient\"s existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\nFDA REGULA TORY STATUS\nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the\ngeneral regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are\navailable under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity testing.\nTo date, the FDA  has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who receive testing for genes associated with epileptic\nencephalopathies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For Dravet syndrome, which\nappears to have the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-associated variants is high (up to 80%). For other\nearly-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true clinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However , studies reporting on the\noverall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy have reported detection rates for clinically significant\nvariants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The clinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known pathogenic variant.\nThe presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication management, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive\nplanning. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants associated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes\nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test validity , changes in reproductive decision making,\nsymptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, resource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity . For most genetic epilepsies, which\nare thought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic variants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a\nlarge body of literature on associations between genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly understood. Published\nliterature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which have not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of\nstudies have also reported associations between genetic variants and antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment response, AED adverse ef fect risk, epilepsy\nphenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The largest number of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics,\nwhich has generally reported some association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , EPHX1 , CYP2C9 ,\nCYP2C19 ) and AED response. Similarly , genetic associations between a number of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported.\nHowever , no empirical evidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the changes in clinical management that\nmight occur as a result of testing are not well-defined. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Neurology et al.\nIn 2006, the American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society published joint guidelines on the diagnostic assessment of children with\nstatus epilepticus.86, These guidelines were reviewed and reaf firmed in 2022. With regard to  whether genetic testing should be routinely ordered  for\nchildren with status epilepticus, the guidelines stated: \"There is insuf ficient evidence to support or refute whether such studies should be done\nroutinely .”\nIn 2000, the American Academy of Neurology , Child Neurology Society , and the American Epilepsy Society published joint guidelines for evaluating a\nfirst nonfebrile seizure in children.87, This guidance was reviewed and reaf firmed in 2023. Routine electroencephalography was recommended  as part\nof the diagnostic evaluation; genetic testing was not addressed .\nInternational League Against Epilepsy\nIn 2015, the International League Against Epilepsy issued a report with recommendations on the management of infantile seizures, which included the\nfollowing related to genetic testing in epilepsy41,:\n\"Genetic screening should not be undertaken at a primary or secondary level of care, as the screening to identify those in need of specific\ngenetic analysis is based  on tertiary settings.”\n\"Standard care should permit genetic counseling by trained personnel to be undertaken at all levels of care (primary to quaternary).”\n\"Genetic evaluation for Dravet syndrome and other infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathies should be available at tertiary and quaternary\nlevels of care (optimal intervention would permit an extended genetic evaluation).”\n\"Early diagnosis of some mitochondrial conditions may alter long-term  outcome, but whether screening at quaternary level is beneficial is\nunknown.”\nNational Society of Genetic Counselors\nIn 2022, the National Society of Genetic Counselors published a practice guideline on genetic testing and counseling for unexplained epilepsies.88,The\nSociety made the following relevant recommendations:\n\"We strongly recommend that individ uals with unexplained epilepsy be of fered genetic testing,  without limitation of age.\nWe strongly recommend comprehensive, multi- gene  testing, such as exome/ge nome sequencing  or multi- gene panel  as a first- tier test.\nWe conditionally recommend exome/ge nome sequencing  over multi- gene panel  as the first- tier test.\nThe multi-gene panel should have a minimum of 25 genes and  include copy number analysis.\"\n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.109 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nEuropean Academy of Neurology\nIn 2010, the European Federation of Neurological Societies (now the European Academy of Neurology) issued guidelines on the molecular diagnosis\nof channelopathies, epilepsies, migraine, stroke, and dementias.89, The guidelines made the following recommendations on epilepsy:\n\"There is good evidence to suggest that a thorough clinical and electrophysiological investigation may lead to the choice of the gene to be tested in\npatients with periodic paralysis (Level B). In myotonic disorders, it is recommended to first search for myotonic dystrophy and use clinical and\nelectrophysiological phenotype characterization to guide for molecular genetic testing (Level B).\nMolecular investigations are possible and may help in some cases to diagnose the condition but cannot be considered  as a routine procedure with\nregard to  the large  number of dif ferent mutations [variants] in dif ferent genes. Furthermore, diagnosis can be made more easily by clinical and\nphysiological investigation (Good Practice Point). One exception of note is the diagnosis of SMEI , in which mutations [variants] are found  in SCN1A  in\n80% of the patients (Level B).”\nNorth American Consensus Panel\nIn 2017, recommendations were published from a consensus panel of 14 physicians and 5 family members/caregivers of patients with Dravet\nsyndrome.90, There was strong consensus among panel members that genetic testing should be completed in all patients with clinical suspicion for\nDravet syndrome since this can lead to earlier diagnosis. Options for testing include SCN1A  sequencing followed by testing for deletions and\nduplications if sequencing is negative, or epilepsy gene panel testing, with no consensus among panel members about which option is superior . There\nwas strong consensus that epilepsy gene panel testing is preferred to SCN1A  testing if the clinical presentation is less clear or if the patient has\natypical features, and that karyotyping is not needed. The panel did not reach consensus about the utility of chromosomal microarray in patients with\nsuspected Dravet syndrome (72.2% agreed, 22.2% disagreed, 5.6% did not know) and concluded that this test can be considered. Based on strong\nconsensus, the panel recommended genetic testing in the following circumstances among children with normal development, seizures of unknown\netiology , and no evidence of causal lesion in the brain: infants with at least 2 prolonged focal febrile seizures, or children aged 1 to 3 years with at least\none prolonged febrile seizure before 18 months of age or myoclonic or atypical absence seizures that are refractory to at least one antiepileptic\nmedication. Infants who experience a single prolonged focal or generalized convulsion do not require genetic testing (strong consensus), but this can\nbe considered in children aged 1 to 3 years who experience multiple brief episodes of febrile seizure activity before 18 months of age or myoclonic or\natypical absence seizures that do not respond to antiepileptic medication (moderate consensus). The panel had moderate consensus about the role of\ngenetic testing (epilepsy gene panel) in teens and adults without congenital dysmorphism who have seizure activity resistant to antiepileptic medication\nand lack an early life history .\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for determining hereditary breast and\novarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy . Testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all\nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years, may be indicated for\nguiding cancer therapies. Genetic testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in breast cancer-, pancreatic cancer-, prostate cancer-, or ovarian cancer-\naffected individuals who are considering systemic therapy is addressed separately in evidence reviews 2.04.151, 2.04.148, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156,\nrespectively . Genetic testing for PALB2  variants in pancreatic cancer-af fected individuals is also addressed in 2.04.148. Additionally , conflicting criteria\nreflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited or no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of\ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.\nCurrent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation. W omen with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should\nreceive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant. In addition, there are potential harms related to stigmatization and discrimination. See policy 2.04.128 regarding testing of BRCA1 , BRCA2,\nand PALB2  for Fanconi anemia. See policies 2.04.148, 2.04.151, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156 regarding genetic testing to guide targeted therapy .\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine T umors\nCurrent NCCN guidelines for pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( v .2.2024) refers to the NCCN guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk assessment of breast,\novarian, and pancreatic cancers detailed above, and state: \"The panel recommends germline testing in any patient with confirmed pancreatic cancer\nand in those in whom there is a clinical suspicion for inherited susceptibility .\" The panel recommends \"using comprehensive gene panels for hereditary\ncancer syndromes.\"89,\nThe NCCN guidelines for genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers ( v .3.2024) states that germline testing is\nclinically indicated for individuals with neuroendocrine pancreatic cancers per the NCCN guidelines on neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors.90, The\nNCCN guidelines for neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors ( v .1.2024) states, \"consider genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing: In a patient with\nduodenal/pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at any age\", noting, \"studies of unselected patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have identified\ngermline variants in 16%-17% of cases. However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result\non the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nStandard whole exome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered medically necessary  for the\nevaluation of unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL of the following criteria are met :\n1. Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

Rapid genome sequencing (81425, 81426, 0094U) is considered investigational  for all \nother indications. \nback to top  \n \nNOTES AND DEFINITIONS  \nExome Sequencing (ES)  is a genomic technique for sequencing all of the protein-coding regions \nof genes in the genome (also known as the exome). \nGenom\ne Sequencing (GS)  is a genomic technique for sequencing the complete DNA sequence, \nwhich includes protein coding as well as non- codin g DNA elements.  \nTrio \nTesting  includes testing of the child and both biological/genetic parents and increases the \nchances of finding a definitive diagnosis, while reducing false- positi ve findings.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  10 \n \nComparator Exome Sequencing is used only for comparison with the proband (individual \nundergoing exome sequencing) and is used to inform the pathogenicity of variants. A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022).

The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available. They suggest that there should be predicted impact on health outcomes, including immediate impact on medical manag ement based on the \nmolecular results.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants.

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES.

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nIn patients with a known high risk of respiratory failure (eg, those with LGMD2I ...), clinicians should\nobtain periodic pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force in the\nupright position and, if normal, in the supine position) or evaluation by a pulmonologist to identify and\ntreat respiratory insuf ficiency .B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2B and LGMD2L  for pulmonary evaluation\nunless they are symptomatic.C\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with excessive daytime somnolence, nonrestorative\nsleep (eg, frequent nocturnal arousals, morning headaches, excessive daytime fatigue), or respiratory\ninsuf ficiency based on pulmonary function tests for pulmonary or sleep medicine consultation for\nconsideration of noninvasive ventilation to improve quality of life.B\nLOE: level of evidence; LGMD: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy .\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a clinical practice guideline for the use of whole exome\nsequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) and made the following recommendation: \"W e strongly recommend ES [exome sequencing]\nand GS [genome sequencing] as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician-patient/family shared decision making\nafter CMA  [chromosomal microarray] or focused testing) for patients with one or more CAs [congenital anomalies] pior to one year of age or for patients\nwith DD/ID [developmental delay/intellectual disability] with onset prior to 18 years of age.\"54, The recommendation was informed by a systematic\nevidence review and a health technology assessment conducted by Ontario Health.\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Dixon-Salazar TJ, Silhavy JL, Udpa N, et al.

Lead to changes in medication management; AND/OR  \n2. Lead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests \nare avoided; AND/OR  \n3. Lead to changes in reproductive decision-making.  \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other indications. There is \ninsufficient evidence to support a general conclusion concerning the health outcomes or \nbenefits associated with this procedure.  \nPolicy Guidelines \nApplication of Medically Necessary Policy Statement  \nAlthough there is no standard definition of epileptic encephalopathies, they are generally \ncharacterized by at least some of the following: (1) onset in early childhood (often in infancy); (2) \nrefractory to therapy; (3) associated with developmental delay or regression; and (4) severe \nelectroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities. There is a challenge in defining the population \nappropriate for testing given that specific epileptic syndromes may be associated with different \nEEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe \nseizures prior to the onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However, for this \npolicy, the medically necessary policy statement would apply for patients with: \n1. Onset of seizures in early childhood (i.e., before the age of 5 years); AND  \n2. Clinically severe seizures that affect daily functioning and/or interictal EEG \nabnormalities; AND POLICY  PRODUCT VARIATIONS  DESCRIPTION/BACKGROUND  \nRATIONALE  DEFINITIONS   BENEFIT VARIATIONS  \nDISCLAIMER  CODING INFORMATION  REFERENCES  \nPOLICY HISTORY     \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 2  \n3. No other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient’s symptoms.  \nIncluded Tests/Conditions \nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that is possibly genetic.  In 2010, the International \nLeague Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as having underlying genetic cause or etiology \nwhen, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic \ndefect and seizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or \nmetabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy. The updated 2017 ILAE classification system does \nnot discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause. \nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (e.g., Dravet syndrome, early infantile \nepileptic encephalopathy, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and \nintellectual disability limited to females, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and others). Other \nclinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes but are generally secondary to the \nepilepsy itself. \nExcluded Tests and Conditions \nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of \nsymptomatology, of which seizures may be one, such as the neurocutaneous disorders (e.g., \nneurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral \nmalformations or abnormal cortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. \nGenetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed in other policies (see Cross-\nreference section).  \nTesting that is limited to genotyping of CYP450  genes is addressed separately (MP 2.234). \nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B*1502 allelic variant in patients \nof Asian ancestry prior to considering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe \ndermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) labeling for carbamazepine. \nThis policy also does not address the use of testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA \npolymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically suspected mitochondrial disorders \nprior to initiation of therapy with valproate. Valproate’s label contains a black box warning \nrelated to increased risk of acute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients \nwith POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA labeling states: “Valproate \nis contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by variants in \nmitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG; e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) and children \nunder two years of age who are suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.  \nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and Testing Strategy \nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, are severe, and are characterized by epilepsy as the primary manifestation, without \nassociated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League \nAgainst Epilepsy, these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndrome \nassociated with a high probability of encephalopathic features that present or worsen after the \nonset of epilepsy. Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 3  \nintellectual disability, may be present secondary to the epilepsy itself. Specific clinical \nsyndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include: \n Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n[SMEI] or polymorphic myoclonic epilepsy in infancy [PMEI]) \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with intellectual disability) \n Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep \n GEFS+ syndrome (generalized epilepsies with febrile seizures plus) \n Ohtahara syndrome (also known as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst \nsuppression pattern) \n Landau-Kleffner syndrome \n West syndrome  \n Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. \nVariants in a large number of genes have been associated with early-onset epilepsies.

If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based on history, EEG findings, and \nother test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most \nlikely to be involved, followed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular, if an \nSCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+), molecular genetic \ntesting of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by \ndeletion/duplication analysis if a pathogenic variant is not identified, should be obtained.  \nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses \na multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In these cases, panels should meet the \ncriteria outlined in MP 2.323 (General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels). \nCriteria for use of whole exome sequencing are outlined in MP 2.324 (Whole Exome and Whole \nGenome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders). \nGenetics Nomenclature Update \nThe Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants \nfound in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \nPG2). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP) standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants \nrepresent expert opinion from ACMG, AMP, and the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG2.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \n \nCross-reference:  \nMP 2.234  Cytochrome P450 Genotype Guided Treatment Strategy \nMP 2.276  Genetic Testing for FMR1  Variants (Including Fragile X Syndrome) \nMP 2.323  General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels       \nMP 2.324  Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic \nDisorders  \nMP 2.326 General Approach to Genetic Testing \n \nII.

It is a common \nneurologic disorder, with approximate 3% of the population developing the disorder over their \nentire lifespan.  \nSudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as a sudden, unexpected, \nnontraumatic, and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy, excluding documented status \nepilepticus, with no cause of death identified following comprehensive postmortem evaluation.  \nClassification \nEpilepsy is heterogeneous in etiology and clinical expression and can be classified in a variety \nof ways. Most commonly, classification is done by the clinical phenotype, i.e., the type of \nseizures that occur. In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) updated its \nclassification system that is widely used for clinical care and research purposes (see Table 1). \nClassification of seizures can also be done on the basis of age of onset: neonatal, infancy, \nchildhood, and adolescent/adult. \nTable 1.

Genetic epilepsies are characterized by recurrent unprovoked \nseizures in patients who do not have demonstrable brain lesions or metabolic abnormalities. In \naddition, seizures are the core symptom of the disorder, and other symptomatology is not \npresent, except as a direct result of seizures. This is differentiated from genetically determined \nconditions in which seizures are part of a larger syndrome, such as tuberous sclerosis, fragile X \nsyndrome, or Rett syndrome. \nThe review focuses on the category of genetic epilepsies in which seizures are the primary \nclinical manifestation. This category does not include syndromes that have multiple clinical \nmanifestations, of which seizures may be one. Examples of syndromes that include seizures are \nRett syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Genetic testing for these syndromes will not be \nassessed herein but may be included in separate reviews that specifically address genetic \ntesting for that syndrome. \nGenetic epilepsies can be further broken down by type of seizures. For example, genetic \ngeneralized epilepsy refers to patients who have convulsive (grand mal) seizures, while genetic \nabsence epilepsy refers to patients with nonconvulsive (absence) seizures. The disorders are \nalso sometimes classified by the age of onset. \nThe category of genetic epilepsies includes a number of rare epilepsy syndromes that present in \ninfancy or early childhood. These syndromes are characterized by epilepsy as the primary \nmanifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. They are often \nsevere and sometimes refractory to medication treatment. They may involve other clinical \nmanifestations such as developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, which in many cases \nare thought to be caused by frequent uncontrolled seizures. In these cases, the epileptic \nsyndrome may be classified as an epileptic encephalopathy, which is described by ILAE as \ndisorders in which the epileptic activity itself may contribute to severe cognitive and behavioral \nimpairments above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology alone \nand that these can worsen over time. A partial list of severe early-onset epilepsy syndromes is \nas follows: \n Dravet syndrome \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with mental retardation) \n Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy \n GEFS+ syndrome (genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus) \n EIEE syndrome (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst) \n West syndrome \n Ohtahara syndrome \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 8  \nDravet syndrome falls on a spectrum of SCN1A- related seizure disorders, which includes febrile \nseizures at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized \ntonic-clonic seizures at the severe end. The spectrum may be associated with multiple seizure \nphenotypes, with a broad spectrum of severity; more severe seizure disorders may be \nassociated with cognitive impairment, or deterioration. Ohtahara syndrome is a severe early-\nonset epilepsy syndrome characterized by intractable tonic spasms, other seizures, interictal \nelectroencephalography abnormalities, and developmental delay. It may be secondary to \nstructural abnormalities but has been associated with variants in the STXBP1  gene in rare \ncases. West syndrome is an early-onset seizure disorder associated with infantile spasms and \nthe characteristic electroencephalography finding of hypsarrhythmia. Other seizure disorders \npresenting early in childhood may have a genetic component but are characterized by a more \nbenign course, including benign familial neonatal seizures and benign familial infantile seizures. \nGenetic Etiology \nMost genetic epilepsies are primarily believed to involve multifactorial inheritance patterns. This \nfollows the concept of a threshold effect, in which any particular genetic defect may increase the \nrisk of epilepsy but is not by itself causative. A combination of risk-associated genes, together \nwith environmental factors, determines whether the clinical phenotype of epilepsy occurs. In this \nmodel, individual genes that increase the susceptibility to epilepsy have a relatively weak \nimpact. Multiple genetic defects, and/or a particular combination of genes, probably increase the \nrisk by a greater amount. However, it is not well understood how many abnormal genes are \nrequired to exceed the threshold to cause clinical epilepsy, nor is it understood which \ncombination of genes may increase the risk more than others. \nEarly-onset epilepsy syndromes may be single-gene disorders. Because of the small amount of \nresearch available, the evidence base for these rare syndromes is incomplete, and new variants \nare currently being frequently discovered.   \nSome of the most common genes associated with genetic epileptic syndromes are listed in \nTable 2.  \nTable 2.

Ohtahara syndrome \nhas been associated with variants in STXBP1  in cases where patients have no structural or \nmetabolic abnormalities. West syndrome is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities or \ntuberous sclerosis or may be secondary to an identifiable infectious or metabolic cause, but \nwhen there is no underlying cause identified, it is thought to be due to a multifactorial genetic \npredisposition.   \nColl et al (2016) evaluated the use of a custom resequencing panel including genes related to \nsudden death, epilepsy, and SUDEP. New potential candidate genes for SUDEP were detected: \nFBN1, HCN1, SCN4A, EFHC1, CACNA1A, SCN11A, and SCN10A. \nTargeted testing for individual genes is available. Several commercial epilepsy genetic panels \nare also available. The number of genes included in the tests varies widely, from about 50 to \nover 450. The panels frequently include genes for other disorders such as neural tube defects, \nlysosomal storage disorders, cardiac channelopathies, congenital disorders of glycosylation, \nmetabolic disorders, neurologic syndromes, and multisystemic genetic syndromes. Some \npanels are designed to be comprehensive while other panels target specific subtypes of \nepilepsy. Chambers et al (2016) reviewed comprehensive epilepsy panels from 7 U.S.-based \nclinical laboratories and found that between 1% and 4% of panel contents were genes not \nknown to be associated with primary epilepsy. Between 1% and 70% of the genes included on \nan individual panel were not on any other panel. \nTreatment \nThe condition is generally chronic, requiring treatment with one or more medications to \nadequately control symptoms. Seizures can be controlled by antiepileptic medications in most \ncases, but some patients are resistant to medications, and further options such as surgery, \nvagus nerve stimulation, and/or the ketogenic diet can be used.   \nPharmacogenomics \nAnother area of interest for epilepsy is the pharmacogenomics of antiepileptic medications. \nThere are a wide variety of these medications, from numerous different classes. The choice of \nmedications, and the combinations of medications for patients who require treatment with more \nthan 1 agent is complex. Approximately one-third of patients are considered refractory to \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 10  \nmedications, defined as inadequate control of symptoms with a single medication. These \npatients often require escalating doses and/or combinations of different medications. At present, \nselection of agents is driven by the clinical phenotype of seizures but has a large trial-and-error \ncomponent in many refractory cases. The current focus of epilepsy pharmacogenomics is in \ndetecting genetic markers that identify patients likely to be refractory to the most common \nmedications. This may lead to directed treatment that will result in a more efficient process for \nmedication selection, and potentially more effective control of symptoms. \nOf note, genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry, prior to \nconsidering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions, is \nrecommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling for carbamazepine.   \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments. Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are \navailable under the auspices of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories \nthat offer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement \nAmendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has \nchosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.  \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \n \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \n \nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who \nreceive testing for genes associated with epileptic encephalopathies, the evidence includes \nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are \ntest accuracy and validity, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For Dravet syndrome, which appears to \nhave the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-\nassociated variants is high ( 80%). For other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true \nclinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However, studies reporting on \nthe overall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy \nhave reported detection rates for clinically significant variants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The \nclinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known \npathogenic variant. The presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication \nmanagement, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive planning. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in \nthe net health outcome. \nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants \nassociated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort \nstudies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, changes in \nreproductive decision making, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For most genetic epilepsies, which are \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 11  \nthought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic \nvariants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a large body of literature on associations \nbetween genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly \nunderstood. Published literature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which \nhave not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of studies have also \nreported associations between genetic variants and AED treatment response, AED adverse \neffect risk, epilepsy phenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. The largest \nnumber of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics, which has generally reported \nsome association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , \nEPHX1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 ), and  AED response. Similarly, genetic associations between a \nnumber of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported. However, no empirical \nevidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the \nchanges in clinical management that might occur as a result of testing are not well defined. The \nevidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nN/A \n \nVI.

P OLICY               \nGenetic testing for genes associated with infantile- and early-childhood onset epilepsy \nsyndromes in individuals with infantile- and early-childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes in which \nepilepsy is the core clinical symptom (see Policy Guidelines section) may be considered \nmedically necessary if positive test results may: \n \n1. Lead to changes in medication management; AND/OR  \n2. Lead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests \nare avoided; AND/OR  \n3. Lead to changes in reproductive decision-making.  \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other indications. There is \ninsufficient evidence to support a general conclusion concerning the health outcomes or \nbenefits associated with this procedure.  \nPolicy Guidelines \nApplication of Medically Necessary Policy Statement  \nAlthough there is no standard definition of epileptic encephalopathies, they are generally \ncharacterized by at least some of the following: (1) onset in early childhood (often in infancy); (2) \nrefractory to therapy; (3) associated with developmental delay or regression; and (4) severe \nelectroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities. There is a challenge in defining the population \nappropriate for testing given that specific epileptic syndromes may be associated with different \nEEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe \nseizures prior to the onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However, for this \npolicy, the medically necessary policy statement would apply for patients with: \n1. Onset of seizures in early childhood (i.e., before the age of 5 years); AND  \n2. Clinically severe seizures that affect daily functioning and/or interictal EEG \nabnormalities; AND POLICY  PRODUCT VARIATIONS  DESCRIPTION/BACKGROUND  \nRATIONALE  DEFINITIONS   BENEFIT VARIATIONS  \nDISCLAIMER  CODING INFORMATION  REFERENCES  \nPOLICY HISTORY     \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 2  \n3. No other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient’s symptoms.  \nIncluded Tests/Conditions \nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that is possibly genetic.  In 2010, the International \nLeague Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as having underlying genetic cause or etiology \nwhen, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic \ndefect and seizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or \nmetabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy. The updated 2017 ILAE classification system does \nnot discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause. \nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (e.g., Dravet syndrome, early infantile \nepileptic encephalopathy, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and \nintellectual disability limited to females, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and others). Other \nclinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes but are generally secondary to the \nepilepsy itself. \nExcluded Tests and Conditions \nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of \nsymptomatology, of which seizures may be one, such as the neurocutaneous disorders (e.g., \nneurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral \nmalformations or abnormal cortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. \nGenetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed in other policies (see Cross-\nreference section).  \nTesting that is limited to genotyping of CYP450  genes is addressed separately (MP 2.234). \nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B*1502 allelic variant in patients \nof Asian ancestry prior to considering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe \ndermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) labeling for carbamazepine. \nThis policy also does not address the use of testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA \npolymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically suspected mitochondrial disorders \nprior to initiation of therapy with valproate. Valproate’s label contains a black box warning \nrelated to increased risk of acute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients \nwith POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA labeling states: “Valproate \nis contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by variants in \nmitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG; e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) and children \nunder two years of age who are suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.  \nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and Testing Strategy \nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, are severe, and are characterized by epilepsy as the primary manifestation, without \nassociated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League \nAgainst Epilepsy, these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndrome \nassociated with a high probability of encephalopathic features that present or worsen after the \nonset of epilepsy. Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 3  \nintellectual disability, may be present secondary to the epilepsy itself. Specific clinical \nsyndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include: \n Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n[SMEI] or polymorphic myoclonic epilepsy in infancy [PMEI]) \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with intellectual disability) \n Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep \n GEFS+ syndrome (generalized epilepsies with febrile seizures plus) \n Ohtahara syndrome (also known as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst \nsuppression pattern) \n Landau-Kleffner syndrome \n West syndrome  \n Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. \nVariants in a large number of genes have been associated with early-onset epilepsies.

If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based on history, EEG findings, and \nother test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most \nlikely to be involved, followed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular, if an \nSCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+), molecular genetic \ntesting of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by \ndeletion/duplication analysis if a pathogenic variant is not identified, should be obtained.  \nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses \na multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In these cases, panels should meet the \ncriteria outlined in MP 2.323 (General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels). \nCriteria for use of whole exome sequencing are outlined in MP 2.324 (Whole Exome and Whole \nGenome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders). \nGenetics Nomenclature Update \nThe Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants \nfound in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \nPG2). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP) standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants \nrepresent expert opinion from ACMG, AMP, and the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG2.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \n \nCross-reference:  \nMP 2.234  Cytochrome P450 Genotype Guided Treatment Strategy \nMP 2.276  Genetic Testing for FMR1  Variants (Including Fragile X Syndrome) \nMP 2.323  General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels       \nMP 2.324  Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic \nDisorders  \nMP 2.326 General Approach to Genetic Testing \n \nII.

It is a common \nneurologic disorder, with approximate 3% of the population developing the disorder over their \nentire lifespan.  \nSudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as a sudden, unexpected, \nnontraumatic, and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy, excluding documented status \nepilepticus, with no cause of death identified following comprehensive postmortem evaluation.  \nClassification \nEpilepsy is heterogeneous in etiology and clinical expression and can be classified in a variety \nof ways. Most commonly, classification is done by the clinical phenotype, i.e., the type of \nseizures that occur. In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) updated its \nclassification system that is widely used for clinical care and research purposes (see Table 1). \nClassification of seizures can also be done on the basis of age of onset: neonatal, infancy, \nchildhood, and adolescent/adult. \nTable 1.

Genetic epilepsies are characterized by recurrent unprovoked \nseizures in patients who do not have demonstrable brain lesions or metabolic abnormalities. In \naddition, seizures are the core symptom of the disorder, and other symptomatology is not \npresent, except as a direct result of seizures. This is differentiated from genetically determined \nconditions in which seizures are part of a larger syndrome, such as tuberous sclerosis, fragile X \nsyndrome, or Rett syndrome. \nThe review focuses on the category of genetic epilepsies in which seizures are the primary \nclinical manifestation. This category does not include syndromes that have multiple clinical \nmanifestations, of which seizures may be one. Examples of syndromes that include seizures are \nRett syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Genetic testing for these syndromes will not be \nassessed herein but may be included in separate reviews that specifically address genetic \ntesting for that syndrome. \nGenetic epilepsies can be further broken down by type of seizures. For example, genetic \ngeneralized epilepsy refers to patients who have convulsive (grand mal) seizures, while genetic \nabsence epilepsy refers to patients with nonconvulsive (absence) seizures. The disorders are \nalso sometimes classified by the age of onset. \nThe category of genetic epilepsies includes a number of rare epilepsy syndromes that present in \ninfancy or early childhood. These syndromes are characterized by epilepsy as the primary \nmanifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. They are often \nsevere and sometimes refractory to medication treatment. They may involve other clinical \nmanifestations such as developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, which in many cases \nare thought to be caused by frequent uncontrolled seizures. In these cases, the epileptic \nsyndrome may be classified as an epileptic encephalopathy, which is described by ILAE as \ndisorders in which the epileptic activity itself may contribute to severe cognitive and behavioral \nimpairments above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology alone \nand that these can worsen over time. A partial list of severe early-onset epilepsy syndromes is \nas follows: \n Dravet syndrome \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with mental retardation) \n Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy \n GEFS+ syndrome (genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus) \n EIEE syndrome (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst) \n West syndrome \n Ohtahara syndrome \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 8  \nDravet syndrome falls on a spectrum of SCN1A- related seizure disorders, which includes febrile \nseizures at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized \ntonic-clonic seizures at the severe end. The spectrum may be associated with multiple seizure \nphenotypes, with a broad spectrum of severity; more severe seizure disorders may be \nassociated with cognitive impairment, or deterioration. Ohtahara syndrome is a severe early-\nonset epilepsy syndrome characterized by intractable tonic spasms, other seizures, interictal \nelectroencephalography abnormalities, and developmental delay. It may be secondary to \nstructural abnormalities but has been associated with variants in the STXBP1  gene in rare \ncases. West syndrome is an early-onset seizure disorder associated with infantile spasms and \nthe characteristic electroencephalography finding of hypsarrhythmia. Other seizure disorders \npresenting early in childhood may have a genetic component but are characterized by a more \nbenign course, including benign familial neonatal seizures and benign familial infantile seizures. \nGenetic Etiology \nMost genetic epilepsies are primarily believed to involve multifactorial inheritance patterns. This \nfollows the concept of a threshold effect, in which any particular genetic defect may increase the \nrisk of epilepsy but is not by itself causative. A combination of risk-associated genes, together \nwith environmental factors, determines whether the clinical phenotype of epilepsy occurs. In this \nmodel, individual genes that increase the susceptibility to epilepsy have a relatively weak \nimpact. Multiple genetic defects, and/or a particular combination of genes, probably increase the \nrisk by a greater amount. However, it is not well understood how many abnormal genes are \nrequired to exceed the threshold to cause clinical epilepsy, nor is it understood which \ncombination of genes may increase the risk more than others. \nEarly-onset epilepsy syndromes may be single-gene disorders. Because of the small amount of \nresearch available, the evidence base for these rare syndromes is incomplete, and new variants \nare currently being frequently discovered.   \nSome of the most common genes associated with genetic epileptic syndromes are listed in \nTable 2.  \nTable 2.

Ohtahara syndrome \nhas been associated with variants in STXBP1  in cases where patients have no structural or \nmetabolic abnormalities. West syndrome is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities or \ntuberous sclerosis or may be secondary to an identifiable infectious or metabolic cause, but \nwhen there is no underlying cause identified, it is thought to be due to a multifactorial genetic \npredisposition.   \nColl et al (2016) evaluated the use of a custom resequencing panel including genes related to \nsudden death, epilepsy, and SUDEP. New potential candidate genes for SUDEP were detected: \nFBN1, HCN1, SCN4A, EFHC1, CACNA1A, SCN11A, and SCN10A. \nTargeted testing for individual genes is available. Several commercial epilepsy genetic panels \nare also available. The number of genes included in the tests varies widely, from about 50 to \nover 450. The panels frequently include genes for other disorders such as neural tube defects, \nlysosomal storage disorders, cardiac channelopathies, congenital disorders of glycosylation, \nmetabolic disorders, neurologic syndromes, and multisystemic genetic syndromes. Some \npanels are designed to be comprehensive while other panels target specific subtypes of \nepilepsy. Chambers et al (2016) reviewed comprehensive epilepsy panels from 7 U.S.-based \nclinical laboratories and found that between 1% and 4% of panel contents were genes not \nknown to be associated with primary epilepsy. Between 1% and 70% of the genes included on \nan individual panel were not on any other panel. \nTreatment \nThe condition is generally chronic, requiring treatment with one or more medications to \nadequately control symptoms. Seizures can be controlled by antiepileptic medications in most \ncases, but some patients are resistant to medications, and further options such as surgery, \nvagus nerve stimulation, and/or the ketogenic diet can be used.   \nPharmacogenomics \nAnother area of interest for epilepsy is the pharmacogenomics of antiepileptic medications. \nThere are a wide variety of these medications, from numerous different classes. The choice of \nmedications, and the combinations of medications for patients who require treatment with more \nthan 1 agent is complex. Approximately one-third of patients are considered refractory to \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 10  \nmedications, defined as inadequate control of symptoms with a single medication. These \npatients often require escalating doses and/or combinations of different medications. At present, \nselection of agents is driven by the clinical phenotype of seizures but has a large trial-and-error \ncomponent in many refractory cases. The current focus of epilepsy pharmacogenomics is in \ndetecting genetic markers that identify patients likely to be refractory to the most common \nmedications. This may lead to directed treatment that will result in a more efficient process for \nmedication selection, and potentially more effective control of symptoms. \nOf note, genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry, prior to \nconsidering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions, is \nrecommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling for carbamazepine.   \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments. Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are \navailable under the auspices of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories \nthat offer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement \nAmendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has \nchosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.  \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \n \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \n \nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who \nreceive testing for genes associated with epileptic encephalopathies, the evidence includes \nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are \ntest accuracy and validity, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For Dravet syndrome, which appears to \nhave the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-\nassociated variants is high ( 80%). For other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true \nclinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However, studies reporting on \nthe overall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy \nhave reported detection rates for clinically significant variants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The \nclinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known \npathogenic variant. The presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication \nmanagement, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive planning. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in \nthe net health outcome. \nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants \nassociated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort \nstudies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, changes in \nreproductive decision making, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For most genetic epilepsies, which are \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 11  \nthought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic \nvariants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a large body of literature on associations \nbetween genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly \nunderstood. Published literature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which \nhave not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of studies have also \nreported associations between genetic variants and AED treatment response, AED adverse \neffect risk, epilepsy phenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. The largest \nnumber of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics, which has generally reported \nsome association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , \nEPHX1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 ), and  AED response. Similarly, genetic associations between a \nnumber of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported. However, no empirical \nevidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the \nchanges in clinical management that might occur as a result of testing are not well defined. The \nevidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nN/A \n \nVI.
