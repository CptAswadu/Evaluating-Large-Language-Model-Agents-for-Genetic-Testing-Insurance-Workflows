Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit). As of September 2024 CytoScan HD Array contains 2.67 million markers for copy number , 750,000 SNVs, and 1.9 million\nnon-polymorphic probes.

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

In addition, in vitro companion diagnostic laboratory tests provide a \nreport of test results of genetic variations an d are essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding \ntherapeutic product. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is one technique that can measure one or more \ngenetic variations as a laboratory diagnostic test, such as when used as a companion in vi tro diagnostic test.  \nPatients with cancer can have recurrent, relapsed, refractory, metastatic, and/or advanced stages III or IV of \ncancer. Clinical studies show that genetic variations in a patient’s cancer can, in concert with clinical factors, \npredict how each individual responds to specific treatments. In application, a report of results of a diagnostic \nlaboratory test using NGS (i.e. information on the cancer’s genetic variations) can contribute to predicting a \npatient’s response to a given drug: good , bad, or none at all. Applications of NGS to predict a patient’s \nresponse to treatment occurs ideally prior to initiation of such treatment.  \nNational Coverage Indications  \nEffective for services performed on or after March 16, 2018, the Centers for  Medica re & Medicaid Services \n(CMS) has determined that Next Generation  Sequencing (NGS) as a diagnostic laboratory test is reasonable \nand necessary  and covered nationally, when performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement  Amendments \n(CLlA) -certified laboratory , when ordered by a treating physician,  and when all of the following requirements \nare met:  \n Patient has:  \n Either recurrent, relapsed, refractory, metastatic, or advanced stage III or IV cancer; and,  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Clinical Medical Policy -Genetic Testing - Page 5 of 8 \n \nNeighborhood Health Plan of RI -910 Douglas Pike, Smithfield, RI 02917. www.nhpri.org .

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Together, all of the exons in a genome are known as the \nexome, which constitutes approximately 1% of the genome and is currently estimated to contain about 85% of heritabl e disease- causing variants.  \nGenome\n sequencing (GS) (also known as ‘whole genome sequencing (WGS)’) is a comprehensive \nmethod that sequences both coding and noncoding regions of the genome. GS has typically been limited to use in the research setting, but is emerging in the clinical setting and has a greater ability \nto detect large deletions or duplications in protein-coding regions compared with ES. GS requires greater data analysis but less DNA preparation prior to sequencing. \nES and GS have been proposed for use in patients presenting with disorders and anomalies not \nimmediately explained by standard clinical workup. Potential candidates for ES and GS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected genetic conditions.  \nRapid exome sequencing (rES) and rapid genome (rGS) sequencing involves sequencing of the exome or genome, respectively, in an accelerated time frame. Preliminary results can typically be returned in less than 7 days, and a final report in less than two weeks. Studies suggest that the use of rES or rGS in acutely -ill infants, presenting with complex phenotypes that are likely rare genetic \nconditions, can identify a genetic diagnosis more quickly, allowing clinicians and family members to change acute medical or surgical management options and end the diagnostic odyssey. Ultra-rapid GS involves sequencing of the genome typically in less than 72 hours and is currently considered investigational.\n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  2 \n \nPOLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

A comparator exome \nis typically one or both biological/genetic parents to the proband. \nCongen\nital anomalies according to ACMG are multiple anomalies not specific to a well -\ndelineated genetic syndrome. These anomalies are structural or functional abnormalities usually evident\n at birth, or shortly thereafter, and can be consequential to an individual’s life expectancy, \nhealth status, physical or social functioning, and typically require medical intervention. \nDeve\nlopmental delay  is a slow -to-meet or not reaching milestones in one or more of the areas of \ndevelopment (communication, motor, cognition, social -emotio nal, or adaptive skills) in the \nexpected way for a child’s age  \nIntellectual disability  (ID) is defined by the DSM- V as:   \na. Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem  solving, planning, \nabstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, \nconfirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence \ntesting. \nb. Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet d evelopmental and \nsociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community. \nc. Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.  \nback to top  \n \nCLINICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  \nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible. Testing of one available parent is a valid alternative if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.  While trio sequencing is preferred and recommended, an alternative method referred to as “Patient Plus” by PreventionGenetics may be considered. “Patient Plus” involves sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) analysis of the patient, and then targeted testing for the key variants found in the patient is p erformed on parental specimens. This approach permits detection of de novo variants \nand phasing of variants in recessive genes to increase diagnostic yield from a singleton sample in situations where full trio sequencing may not be feasible or preferable.  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  11 \n \nExome sequencing or genome sequencing can reveal incidental findings or secondary findings. \nThese findings are defined as results that are not related to the indication for undergoing the sequencing, but may be of medical value or utility. Disclosure of these findings has been a topic of intense debate within the medical genetics community. In 2013, ACMG published recommendations for reporting secondary findings that included a list of conditions to be included. The list currently includes 59 genes that con fer highly -penetrant and medically actionable \nconditions. \nPre-test and post -test genetic counseling that facilitates informed decision -making, the possibility \nto identify secondary finding with the option to ‘opt out’ of receiving these results, elicits patient \npreferences regarding secondary and/or incidental findings if possible, and formulates a plan for returning such results before testing occurs is strongly advised.  \nIf a genetic diagnosis is not found by ES or GS, periodic reanalysis of the previously obtained \ngenomic sequence is recommended. Reevaluation can occur on the variant- level or case-level. \nWhen appropriate, retesting may be considered (see above). Any variants identified and reported prior to the current ACMG variant classification standard s should be reevaluated using the current \nACMG standards.  \nVariant -level reanalysis  should be considered in the following circumstances:  \n● Availability of a new community resource (e.g., gnomAD) \n● Publica\ntion and/or adoption of a novel/updated methodology for variant assessment  \n● Publication of evidence supporting new gene–disease relationships and/or mechanisms of disease  \nCase- level reanalysis should be considered in the following circumstances: \n● Significant changes in clinical and family history occur  \n● Signifi\ncant improvements have been made to the bioinformatics handling of the data  \nback to top  \n \nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  \nStandard Exome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  12 \n \nIn 2021, ACMG published an evidence-based clinical practice guideline on exome and genome \nsequencing for pediat ric patients with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, \n2021).  \n● ACMG recommends using exome or genome sequencing as a first- or second- tier test for \npatients diagnosed with one or more congenital anomalies before the age of 1, or with intellectual disability/developmental delay before the age of 18. (p. 2031)  \n● ACMG recommends exome or genome sequencing for active and long- term clinical \nmanagement of the proband, as well as for implications on family- focused and reproductive \noutcomes. (p. 2032)  \n● These guidelines also recommend consideration of exome sequencing after the results of chromosome microarray or focused genetic testing are uninformative for a patient with one or more congenital anomaly or patients with developmental delay/intell ectual disability. (p. \n2031) \nACMG also released a systematic evidence-based review (Malinowski, 2020) of 167 published studies examining the clinical impact of exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) in individuals with congenital anomalies (CA), developmental delay (DD), and intellectual disability (ID). This systematic review “provide[d] indirect evidence of the clinical and personal utility of ES/GS for patients with CA/DD/ID and their family members,” noting that a “change in clinical management” resulted in over half of the patients examined as a result of their ES/GS results.  \nIn regards to repeat exome sequencing, ACMG published a statement in 2019 recommending that repeat testing be considered when significant changes occur in the patient’s p ersonal and/or family \nhistories, or if there have been improvements in testing methodologies, ability to analyze data, or understanding of the genetic etiology of disease (p. 1296) (Deignan, 2019).  \nIn 2022, ACMG published ACMG SF v3.1, an updated list of genes included in the secondary \nfindings (SF), which added an additional 5 genes bringing the total up to 78 genes (Miller, Lee, Gordon, 2021). ACMG also published a policy statement regarding updated recommendations for reporting of secondary findings in clinical exome and genome sequencing, which clarified that ACMG supports the continued research and discussion around population screening for the genes included in the secondary findings list. However, “ACMG has made it clear that the ACMG SF is not validated for general population screening” (Miller, Lee, Chung, 2021). \nNational Society for Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society for Genetic Counselors (NSGC) released a position statement (2013, updated \n2020) stating the following in regard to secondary and incidental findings in genetic testing:  \n“The National Society of Genetic Counselors strongly advises pre- test counseling that \nfacilitates informed decision -making, elicits patient preferences regarding secondary and/or  \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  13 \n \nincidental findings if possible, an d formulates a plan for returning such results before \ntesting occurs.  \nGermline and somatic genetic testing, in both clinical and research contexts, may identify \nsecondary findings and incidental findings as a part of the test performed. Secondary findings are purposely analyzed as part of the test, but unrelated to the primary testing indication. Incidental findings are detected unexpectedly during the analysis, and also unrelated to the primary testing indication. Both of these types of variants may be di sclosed \nas a part of the return -of-results process.  \nThe pre- test counseling process should establish clear expectations for what categories of \nresults will and will not be returned. Healthcare practitioners conducting the informed consent and return -of-results processes for broad genomic testing and screening should \nensure that their patients have access to practitioners with genetic expertise, such as genetic counselors.”  \nUpToDate   \nUpToDate is an evidence- based clinical decision support resource that is e xpert-authored and goes \nthrough a multi -layered review and consensus process.  \nIntellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause  \n“Whole exome sequencing — WES should be considered for patients with moderate to severe ID \nin whom other standard tests (including CMA) have failed to identify the cause. The diagnostic yield of WES in this setting is approximately 16 to 33 percent. The diagnostic yield is likely lower in patients with mild ID without additional findings and the role of WES testing in this population is not defined. WES testing should be performed with consultation of a clinical geneticist and should include appropriate pretest counseling to discuss the risk of incidental findings unrelated to the child's ID that may be medically actionable (eg, BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). Incidental findings can be minimized if a focused analysis is conducted. Due to the falling costs of sequencing and its high diagnostic yield, WES is rapidly becoming a clinical tool for the evaluation of ID, especially at specialty centers. Adoption of WES testing into the \ndiagnostic process will depend on its cost, availability, access to expert interpretation, and the allocation of resources within each health care setting.”  \nNational Society of Genetic Counselors \nThe National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) published evidence- based practice \nguidelines for individuals with unexplained epilepsy (Smith et al, 2022).

The inclusion criteria for the 1,248 ill infants defined the maximum age at the time of admission as four months.  They found that 24% of infants undergoing rapid exome sequencing had genetic disease. They conclude that diagnostic testing in infants with diseases of unknown etiology, rapid genomic sequencing, including rapid exome \nsequencing can be performed as a fi rst tier test in infants with diseases of unknown etiology at time \nof admission to ICUs. In unstable infants and in those whom a genetic diagnosis was likely to \nimpact immediate management, rapid genomic sequencing had optimal analytic and diagnostic perfo rmance by virtue of shortest time to results. (p. 725) \nPatient-centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nThe PLUGS Exome Sequencing policy acknowledges that exome sequencing “is typically not an \nappropriate first -tier test, but can be appropriate if initial testing is unrevealing, or if there is no \nsingle- gene or panel test available for the particular condition, or if a rapid diagnosis for a \ncritically -ill child is indicated.” (p. 1)\nStandard Genome Sequencing  \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  2021 revision on Next-generation \nsequencing for constitutional variants in the clinical laboratory states the following: \n“… Exome Sequencing or Genome Sequencing provide[s] a broad approach to match detected \nvariants with the clinical phenotype assessed by the laboratory and health- care provider.  Exome \nSequencing may be performed with the intention of restricting interpretation and reporting to \nvariants in genes with specific disease associations with an option to expand the analysis to the \nrest of the exome if the initial analysis is nondiagnostic . Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing \napproaches are most appropriate in the following scenarios: (1) when the phenotype is complex \nand genetically heterogeneous; (2) when the phenotype has unusual features, an atypical clinical   \n \n \n \n\n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Exome and Genome Sequencing for the Diagnosis of \nGenetic   Disorders V2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision : 3/1/2023   \n \n \n  16 \n \ncourse, or unexpected age of onset; (3) when the phenotype is associated with recently described \ndisease genes for which disease -targeted testing is unavailable; (4) when focused testing has \nbeen performed and was nondiagnostic; (5) when sequential testing could cause therapeutic delays; or (6) when the phenotype does not match an identified genetic condition, suggesting the possibility of more than one genetic diagnosis, which has been documented in 4 to 7% of positive cases.  When Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing does not establish a diagnosis, the \ndata can be reanalyzed (section E.6). The potential impact of secondary findings with Exome Sequencing/Genome Sequencing should also be considered (section E.3).” (p. 1400 through 1401)\nRapid Genome Sequencing  \nPatient- centered Laboratory Utilization Guidance (PLUGS) \nPLUGS developed an expert-written rapid genome sequencing coverage policy as part of their \ninsurance alignment focus. This policy references multiple primary research publications with examples of clinical presentations that result in evidence of clinical utility. (p. 3)  \nThey recommend rapid whole genome testing criteria to include acutely ill infants 12 months of age or younger whose features suggest an unknown genetic etiology and have a complex phenotype which may include a combination of multiple congenital anomalies, encephalopathy, symptoms of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, family history suggestive of genetic etiology, laboratory findings suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism and an abnormal response to therapy. The clinical presentation should not fit a well-described syndrome for which rapid \nsingle gene or targeted panel testing is available. They suggest that there should be predicted impact on health outcomes, including immediate impact on medical manag ement based on the \nmolecular results.

Results of testing with ES include known pathogenic variants\ndefinitely associated with disease or a variant of uncertain significance (VUS).13,14 \nPathogenic variants that can be identified by ES include missense, nonsense, \nsplice-site, and small deletions or insertions.\nAt the present time, ES can fail to detect certain classes of disease-causing \nvariants, such as structural variants (e.g., translocations, inversions), abnormal \nchromosome imprinting or methylation, some mid-size insertions and deletions (ca. \n10-500 bp), trinucleotide repeat expansion mutations, deeper intronic mutations, \nand low-level mosaicism. The current evidence base evaluating ES to specifically \nidentify deletions/duplications is limited, but suggests improved detection in recent \nyears.15 \nES has the advantage of decreased turnaround time and increased efficiency \nrelative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes.\nES is associated with technical and analytical variability, including uneven \nsequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, as well as \nvariability in variant classification based on proprietary filtering algorithms and \npotential lack of critical clinical history or family samples.16 \nGuidelines and evidence \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2012) stated the following \nregarding the clinical application of exome and genome testing:17\n\"WGS [whole genome sequencing]/WES should be considered in the clinical \ndiagnostic assessment of a phenotypically affected individual when:\" \no“The phenotype or family history data strongly implicate a genetic etiology, but \nthe phenotype does not correspond with a specific disorder for which a genetic \ntest targeting a specific gene is available on a clinical basis.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

The current technology does not\nsupport short turnaround times, which are often expected in the prenatal setting.\nThere are high rates of false positives, false negatives, and variants of unknown \nclinical significance. These can be expected to be significantly higher than seen \nwhen array CGH is used in prenatal diagnosis.”  \nThe following were recommended pretest considerations: \no“Pretest counseling should be done by a medical geneticist or an affiliated \ngenetic counselor and should include a formal consent process.”  \no“Before initiating WGS/WES, participants should be counseled regarding the \nexpected outcomes of testing, the likelihood and type of incidental results that \ncould be generated, and what results will or will not be disclosed.”  \no“As part of the pretest counseling, a clear distinction should be made between \nclinical and research-based testing. In many cases, findings will include variants \nof unknown significance that might be the subject for research; in such \ninstances a protocol approved by an institutional review board must be in place \nand appropriate prior informed consent obtained from the participant.”  \nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG, 2013) stated the following \nregarding informed consent for exome and genome testing:18\n“Before initiating GS/ES, counseling should be performed by a medical geneticist or\nan affiliated genetic counselor and should include written documentation of consent \nfrom the patient.”  \n“Incidental/secondary findings revealed in either children or adults may have high \nclinical significance for which interventions exist to prevent or ameliorate disease \nseverity. Patients should be informed of this possibility as a part of the informed \nconsent process.”  \n“Pretest counseling should include a discussion of the expected outcomes of \ntesting, the likelihood and type of incidental results that may be generated, and the \ntypes of results that will or will not be returned. Patients should know if and what \ntype of incidental findings may be returned to their referring physician by the \nlaboratory performing the test.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

They stated:19\n“The overall goal of the SFWG [Secondary Findings Working Group] is to \nrecommend a minimum list of genes that places limited excess burden on patients \nand clinical laboratories while maximizing the potential to reduce morbidity and \nmortality when ES/GS is being performed.”  \n“Variants of uncertain significance should not be reported in any gene.”  \n“It is important to reiterate here that use of the SF results should not be a \nreplacement for indication-based diagnostic clinical genetic testing.” \nA table of “ACMG SF v3.0 gene and associated phenotypes recommended for \nreturn as secondary findings from clinical exome and genome sequencing” was \nprovided.

In the future, whole exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing may \nbe part of the stillbirth workup, but it is not currently part of the standard evaluation.\"\nAmerican College Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal \nFetal Medicine \nIn a joint statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the \nSociety for Maternal Fetal Medicine (ACOG/SMFM, 2016; reaffirmed 2023) stated the \nfollowing regarding prenatal ES.27\n“The routine use of whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing for prenatal \ndiagnosis is not recommended outside of the context of clinical trials until sufficient \npeer-reviewed data and validation studies are published.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Since ultrasound and/or MRI imaging is frequently \nlimited, the fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described and \nnew fetal phenotypes for conditions recognized postnatally are now being \nidentified.” \n“There is no universal consensus on the management of IF [incidental findings] and\nSF [secondary findings] and each center should convey their policy detailing \nwhether they are or are not reported, and if reported what is included for parents \nand fetus.” \nData support benefit of prenatal genomic analysis for clinical indications such as \nmultiple congenital anomalies with a negative microarray and previous undiagnosed\nfetus with major or multiple anomalies. Routine prenatal genomic testing (by \nparental request) is not supported by the current body of evidence.\nInternational Society for Prenatal Diagnosis, Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine, \nand Perinatal Quality Foundation \nA joint statement from the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis (ISPD, 2018), \nthe Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM, 2018), and the Perinatal Quality \nFoundation (PQF, 2018) on prenatal ES stated:29\n“The routine use of prenatal [genome wide] sequencing as a diagnostic test cannot \ncurrently be supported due to insufficient validation data and knowledge about its \nbenefits and pitfalls. Prospective studies with adequate population numbers for \nvalidation are needed…. Currently, it is ideally done in the setting of a research \nprotocol. Alternatively, sequencing may be performed outside a research setting on \na case-by-case basis when a genetic disorder is suspected for which a confirmatory\ngenetic diagnosis can be obtained more quickly and accurately by sequencing. \nSuch cases should be managed after consultation with and under the expert \nguidance of genetic professionals working in multidisciplinary teams with expertise \nin the clinical diagnostic application of sequencing, including interpretation of \ngenomic sequencing results and how they translate to the prenatal setting, as well \nas expertise in prenatal imaging and counseling.”  \n“There is currently limited genotype-phenotype correlation for the genetic disorders \nidentified in the fetal period because ultrasound imaging is frequently limited, and \nthe fetal phenotypes of many conditions have not been well described.”  \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

ES \nserves as a powerful diagnostic tool for individuals with rare genetic conditions in which\nthe specific genetic etiology is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup.10,15,30-\n32 \nThe average diagnostic yield of ES is 20-40% depending on the individual's age, \nphenotype, previous workup, and number of comparator samples analyzed.8,11,30,33 \nAmong individuals with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic findings by ES, 5-7% \nreceived a dual molecular diagnosis (i.e., two significant findings associated with \nnon-overlapping clinical presentations).30,33 \nThe use of family trio ES reduces the rate of uncertain findings, adds to the clinical \nsensitivity with regard to the interpretation of clinically novel genes, and increases \nthe diagnostic utility of ES. For example, in three publications the positive rate \nranges from 31-37% in patients undergoing trio analysis compared to 20-23% \npositive rate among proband-only ES.5,30,34,35 \nRe-evaluation of previously obtained exome sequence has the potential for \nadditional diagnostic yield because of constant expansions of existing variant \ndatabases, as well as periodic novel gene discovery.36-38 \nReferences \n1.Shashi V, McConkie-Rosell A, Rosell B, et al The utility of the traditional medical \ngenetics diagnostic evaluation in the context of next-generation sequencing for \nundiagnosed genetic disorders.

Not all of the NCCN criteria are clearly separated for determining hereditary breast and\novarian cancer syndrome versus for guiding therapy . Testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and/or PALB2  outside of the above criteria, such as testing all\nindividuals with triple negative breast cancer or testing all individuals diagnosed with breast cancer under the age of 50 years, may be indicated for\nguiding cancer therapies. Genetic testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in breast cancer-, pancreatic cancer-, prostate cancer-, or ovarian cancer-\naffected individuals who are considering systemic therapy is addressed separately in evidence reviews 2.04.151, 2.04.148, 2.04.155, and 2.04.156,\nrespectively . Genetic testing for PALB2  variants in pancreatic cancer-af fected individuals is also addressed in 2.04.148. Additionally , conflicting criteria\nreflect that some of the NCCN criteria are based on limited or no evidence; the lower level of evidence might be needed when determining coverage of\ntesting mandated by state biomarker legislation.\nCurrent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines recommend screening women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation. W omen with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should\nreceive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation).FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Recommended strategies are listed below .\nIn individuals with a known familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant, targeted testing for the specific variant is recommended.\nIn individuals with unknown familial BRCA  or PALB2  variant:\nTo identify clinically significant variants, NCCN advises testing a relative who has early-onset disease, bilateral disease, or multiple\nprimaries, because that individual has the highest likelihood of obtaining a positive test result. Unless the af fected individual is a\nmember of an ethnic group for which particular founder pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are known, comprehensive genetic\ntesting (ie, full sequencing of the genes and detection of large gene rearrangements) should be performed.\nIf no living family member with breast or ovarian cancer exists, NCCN suggests testing first- or second-degree family members af fected\nwith cancer thought to be related to deleterious BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants (eg, prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , melanoma).\nIf no familial variant can be identified, 2 possible testing strategies are:\nFull sequencing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  followed by testing for large genomic rearrangements (deletions, duplications) only if sequencing\ndetects no variant (negative result).\nMore than 90% of BRCA  variants will be detected by full sequencing.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nAlternatively , simultaneous full sequencing and testing for large genomic rearrangements (also known as comprehensive BRCA  testing; see\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis below) may be performed as is recommended by NCCN.\nComprehensive testing can detect 92.5% of BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants.\nTesting for BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and PALB2  through panel testing over serial testing might be preferred for ef ficiency . Multi-gene panels often\ninclude genes of moderate or low penetrance, and genes with limited evidence on which to base management decisions. When considering a\ngene panel, NCCN recommends use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes\".\nAshkenazi Jewish descent\nIn individuals of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent, one approach is to test for the 3 known founder mutations (185delAG and 5182insC\nin BRCA1 ; 6174delT  in BRCA2 ) first; if testing is negative for founder mutations and if the individual's ancestry also includes non-\nAshkenazi ethnicity (or if other BRCA1/2  testing criteria are met), comprehensive genetic testing should be considered.\nTesting strategy may also include testing individuals not meeting the above criteria who are adopted and have limited medical information on biological\nfamily members, individuals with small family structure, and individuals with presumed paternal transmission.\nComprehensive V ariant Analysis\nComprehensive variant analysis currently includes sequencing the coding regions and intron and exon splice sites, as well as testing to detect large\ndeletions and rearrangements that can be missed with sequence analysis alone. In addition, before August 2006, testing for large deletions and\nrearrangements was not performed, thus some individuals with familial breast cancer who had negative BRCA  testing before this time may consider\nrepeat testing for the rearrangements (see Policy section for criteria).\nHigh-Risk Ethnic Groups\nTesting of eligible individuals who belong to ethnic populations in which there are well-characterized founder mutations should begin with tests\nspecifically for these variants. For example, founder mutations account for approximately three-quarters of the BRCA  variants found in Ashkenazi\nJewish populations (see Rationale section). When testing for founder mutations is negative, a comprehensive variant analysis should then be\nperformed.\nTesting Unaffected Individuals\nIn unaf fected family members of potential BRCA  or PALB2  variant families, most test results will be negative and uninformative. Therefore, it is strongly\nrecommended that an affected  family member be tested first whenever possible to adequately interpret the test. Should a BRCA  or PALB2  variant be\nfound in an af fected family member(s), DNA  from an unaffected  family member can be tested specifically for the same variant of the af fected family\nmember without having to sequence the entire gene. Interpreting test results for an unaf fected family member without knowing the genetic status of the\nfamily may be possible in the case of a positive result for an established disease-associated variant but leads to dif ficulties in interpreting negative test\nresults (uninformative negative) or variants of uncertain significance because the possibility of a causative BRCA  or PALB2  variant is not ruled out.\nTesting for known variants of BRCA  or PALB2  genes in an unaf fected reproductive partner may be indicated as carrier screening for rare autosomal\nrecessive conditions.\nConfirmatory T esting\nConsideration might be given at the local level for confirmatory germline testing of a BRCA  or PALB2  pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant found on\ntumor genomic analyses, direct-to-consumer testing, or research testing.\nTesting Minors\nThe use of genetic testing for BRCA1, BRCA2,  or PALB2  variants for identifying hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome has limited or no\nclinical utility in minors, because there is no change in management for minors as a result of knowledge of the presence or absence of a deleterious\nvariant. In addition, there are potential harms related to stigmatization and discrimination. See policy 2.04.128 regarding testing of BRCA1 , BRCA2,\nand PALB2  for Fanconi anemia.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology- \"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"- to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity , and quality of life (QOL). The accuracy\nof variant testing has been shown to be high. Studies of lifetime risk of cancer for carriers of a BRCA  variant have shown a risk as high as 85%.\nKnowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals at risk of a BRCA  variant may impact health care decisions to reduce risk, including intensive\nsurveillance, chemoprevention, and/or prophylactic intervention. In individuals with BRCA1  or BRCA2  variants, prophylactic mastectomy and\noophorectomy have been found to significantly increase disease-specific survival and OS. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals diagnosed\nwith breast cancer may impact treatment decisions. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.\nFor individuals who have other high-risk cancers (eg, cancers of the fallopian tube, pancreas, prostate) who receive genetic testing for a BRCA1  or\nBRCA2  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test validity ,\nand QOL. The accuracy of variant testing has been shown to be high. Knowledge of BRCA  variant status in individuals with other high-risk cancers can\ninform decisions regarding genetic counseling, chemotherapy , and enrollment in clinical trials. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with a risk of HBOC syndrome who receive genetic testing for a PALB2  variant, the evidence includes studies of clinical validity and\nstudies of breast cancer risk, including a meta-analysis. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . Evidence supporting\nclinical validity was obtained from numerous studies reporting relative risks (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs). Study designs included family segregation, kin-\ncohort, family-based case-control, and population-based case-control. The number of pathogenic variants identified in studies varied from 1 (founder\nmutations) to 48. The RR for breast cancer associated with a PALB2  variant ranged from 2.3 to 13.4, with the 2 family-based studies reporting the\nlowest values. Evidence of preventive interventions in women with PALB2  variants is indirect, relying on studies of high-risk women and BRCA  carriers.\nThese interventions include screening with magnetic resonance imaging, chemoprevention, and risk-reducing mastectomy . Given the penetrance of\nPALB2  variants, the outcomes following bilateral and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy examined in women with a family history consistent with\nhereditary breast cancer (including BRCA1  and BRCA2  carriers) can be applied to women with PALB2  variants, with the benefit-to-risk balance\naffected by penetrance. In women at high-risk of hereditary breast cancer who would consider risk-reducing interventions, identifying a PALB2  variant\nprovides a more precise estimated risk of developing breast cancer compared with family history alone and can of fer women a more accurate\nunderstanding of benefits and potential harms of any intervention. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement\nin the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology\nIn 2024, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a guideline on germline testing in patients with breast cancer .85, The guideline\nrecommends BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing for all patients with breast cancer who are younger than 65 years of age, and some patients over age 65\nyears (including those who are eligible for poly-ADP  ribose polymerase [P ARP] inhibitor therapy). Patients with a history of breast cancer may also be\ncandidates for BRCA1  and BRCA2  testing if it would help determine their personal and family risk. Testing for other high-penetrance genes (ie, PALB2 ,\nTP53 , PTEN , STK1 1, and CDH1 ) may be appropriate for some patients.\nIn 2024, ASCO also published a guideline on germline genetic testing in patients with cancer . Genes with a strong testing recommendation are those\nthat confer a higher cancer risk or are highly actionable. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes for testing and inclusion in\nmultigene panels are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Of these, CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53  are associated with\nspecific syndromes and can be excluded from testing if personal or family history do not suggest an increased risk of the syndrome.86, For epithelial\novarian cancer , the more strongly recommended genes are: BRCA1 , BRCA2 , BRIP1 , EPCAM , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , PALB2 , PMS2 , RAD51C , and\nRAD51D . Testing for BRCA1  and BRCA2  is also strongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer , and testing for PALB2  is\nstrongly recommended for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The authors note that including BRCA1 , BRCA2 , and L ynch syndrome genes (ie, MLH1 ,\nMSH2 , MSH6 , PMS2 , and EPCAM ) in multigene panels for any patient with cancer is reasonable due to their importance and prevalence.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nBreast Cancer and Ovarian Cancer\nCurrent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ( v .3.2024) guidelines on the genetic and familial high-risk assessment of breast, ovarian,\nand pancreatic cancers include criteria for identifying individuals who should be referred for further risk assessment and separate criteria for genetic\ntesting.87, Patients who satisfy any of the testing criteria listed in CRIT -1 through CRIT -4 should undergo \"further personalized risk assessment, genetic\ncounseling, and often genetic testing and management.” For these criteria, both invasive and in situ breast cancers were included. Maternal and\npaternal sides of the family should be considered independently for familial patterns of cancer . Testing of unaf fected individuals should be considered\n\"when no appropriate af fected family member is available for testing.”\nThe recommendations are for testing high penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, specifically BRCA1 , BRCA2 , CDH1 , PALB2 , PTEN,  STK1 1,\nand TP53 . Use of \"tailored panels that are disease-focused and include clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes is preferred over large panels\nthat include genes of uncertain clinical relevance\".\nThe panel does not endorse population based testing, stating instead that the panel, \"continues to endorse a risk-stratified approach and does not\nendorse universal testing of all patients with breast cancer due to limitations of this approach, such as low specificity , shortages in trained genetics\nhealth professionals to provide appropriate pre- and post-test genetic counseling, and lack of evidence to support risk management for genes included\nin many multi-gene panels.\"\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  somatic only variants are uncommon. The NCCN recommends if a somatic variant is identified through tumor profiling, then\nBRCA1  and BRCA2  germline testing is recommended.\nAdditionally , the NCCN ovarian cancer guidelines ( v .2.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for persistent/recurrent disease (OV -6) and describe\nin multiple algorithms that testing should include at least BRCA1/2,  homologous recombination, microsatellite instability , tumor mutational burden, and\nneurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase, (OV -6, OV -7, OV -B Principles of Pathology , OV-C Principles of Systemic Therapy).88,\n \n FEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

However , these studies involved relatively small cohorts of patients.\"\nProstate Cancer\nThe current NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer are version 4.2024.91, The Principles of Genetics and Molecular/Biomarker Analysis section (PROS-\nC) provides appropriate scenarios for germline genetic testing in individuals with a personal history of prostate cancer .\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.92, The guideline states that genetic testing\nshould be made available to all patients with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with\nother genes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, patients who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to patients without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet NCCN\nguideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nSociety of Gynecologic Oncology\nIn 2015, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) published an evidence-based consensus statement on risk assessment for inherited gynecologic\ncancer .93, The statement includes criteria for recommending genetic assessment (counseling with or without testing) to patients who may be\ngenetically predisposed to breast or ovarian cancer . Overall, the SGO and the NCCN recommendations are very similar; the main dif ferences are the\nexclusion of women with breast cancer onset at age 50 years or younger who have 1 or more first-, second-, or third-degree relatives with breast\ncancer at any age; women with breast cancer or history of breast cancer who have a first-, second-, or third-degree male relative with breast cancer;\nand men with a personal history of breast cancer . Additionally , SGO recommends genetic assessment for unaf fected women who have a male relative\nwith breast cancer . Moreover , SGO indicated that some patients who do not satisfy criteria may still benefit from genetic assessment (eg, few female\nrelatives, hysterectomy , or oophorectomy at a young age in multiple family members, or adoption in the lineage).\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017, reaf firmed 2021) published a Practice Bulletin on hereditary breast and ovarian\ncancer syndrome.94, The following recommendation was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (level C): \"Genetic testing is recommended\nwhen the results of a detailed risk assessment that is performed as part of genetic counseling suggest the presence of an inherited cancer syndrome\nfor which specific genes have been identified and when the results of testing are likely to influence medical management.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force\nCurrent U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations (2019)95, for genetic testing of BRCA1  and BRCA2  variants in women\nstate:\n\"The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer\nor who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2  gene mutation with an appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result\non the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, genetic testing (B recommendation). The USPSTFFEP 2.04.02 Germline Genetic Testing for Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Syndrome and Other High-Risk Cancers (BRCA1, BRCA2, P ALB2)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

(D recommendation)\"\nRecommended screening tools included the Ontario Family History Assessment Tool, Manchester Scoring System, Referral Screening Tool, Pedigree\nAssessment Tool, 7-Question Family History Screening Tool, International Breast Cancer Intervention Study instrument (T yrer-Cuziak), and brief\nversions of the BRCAPRO.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere are no national coverage determinations. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of\nlocal Medicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Chapman-Davis E, Zhou ZN, Fields JC, et al.

CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1  variants are considered to be of moderate penetrance. Female carriers of CHEK2, ATM, and\nBARD1  have an approximately 2- to 4-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer compared with the general population. Risk estimates may be\nhigher in patients with a family history of breast cancer or a family history of a specific variant.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this review is to determine whether testing for CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1  variants in individuals with a risk of hereditary breast/ovarian\ncancer improves the net health outcome.\n FEP 2.04.126 Germline Genetic Testing for Gene V ariants Associated With Breast Cancer in Individuals at High Breast Cancer Risk (CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Updated versions of the criteria are available on the NCCN website.\nThe recommended testing strategy for BRCA1, BRCA2,  and PALB2  is described in review 2.04.02 (genetic testing for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer\nsyndrome) .\nGenetic Counseling\nGenetic counseling is primarily aimed at patients who are at risk for inherited disorders, and experts recommend formal genetic counseling in most\ncases when genetic testing for an inherited condition is considered. The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient's existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\n \nFDA REGULA TORY STATUS\n \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the\ngeneral regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1  testing are available under the auspices\nof the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories of fering to test and voluntarily listing is available through the National Center for\nBiotechnology Genetic Testing Registry . Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement\nAmendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\nCustomized next-generation sequencing panels provide simultaneous analysis of multiple cancer predisposition genes, and typically include both\nmoderate- and high-penetrant genes.\n FEP 2.04.126 Germline Genetic Testing for Gene V ariants Associated With Breast Cancer in Individuals at High Breast Cancer Risk (CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member .

Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, and test validity .\nThe available studies on clinical validity have demonstrated that CHEK2  variants are of moderate penetrance, and confer a risk of breast cancer 2 to 4\ntimes that of the general population. Direct evidence for the clinical utility of genetic testing for CHEK2  variants in individuals with risk of HBOC was not\nidentified. It is unclear whether the relative risk (RR) associated with the moderate penetrance variants would increase risk enough beyond that already\nconferred by familial risk to change screening behavior . In contrast to high-penetrance variants , there is unlikely to be a similar benefit-to-risk calculus\nfor risk-reducing mastectomy in women with a moderate penetrance variant such as CHEK2 . The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the\ntechnology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals with risk of HBOC who receive genetic testing for an ATM variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and studies of\nbreast cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . The available studies on clinical validity have demonstrated\nthat ATM variants are of moderate penetrance; moreover , ATM variants confer a risk of breast cancer 2 to 4 times that of the general population. Direct\nevidence for the clinical utility of genetic testing for ATM variants in individuals with risk of HBOC was not identified. It is unclear whether the RR\nassociated with the moderate penetrance variants  would increase risk enough beyond that already conferred by familial risk to change screening\nbehavior . In contrast to high-penetrance variants, there is unlikely to be a similar benefit-to-risk calculus for preventive interventions in women with a\nmoderate penetrance variant such as ATM. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health\noutcome.\nFor individuals with risk of HBOC who receive genetic testing for a BARD1  variant, the evidence includes studies of variant prevalence and studies of\nbreast cancer risk. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, and test validity . The available studies on clinical validity have demonstrated\nthat BARD1  variants are of low to moderate penetrance; BARD1  variants confer a risk of breast cancer about 2 to 3 times that of the general\npopulation. Direct evidence for the clinical utility of genetic testing for BARD1  variants in individuals with a risk of HBOC was not identified. It is unclear\nwhether the RR associated with the low to moderate penetrance variants would increase risk enough beyond that already conferred by familial risk to\nchange screening behavior . In contrast to high-penetrance variants, there is unlikely to be a similar benefit-to-risk calculus for preventive interventions\nin women with a low to moderate penetrance variant such as BARD1 . The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\n \nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nIn 2023, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics published a practice resource on management of individuals with germline\npathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in CHEK2 .48, The guidance document included the following relevant statements:\n\"For CHEK2 heterozygotes with truncating variants, ACMG advises the following:\nPersonalized risk assessment using at least assessment of family history but ideally with a model such as CanRisk is important to consider\nwhen making BC surveillance recommendations.\nFor women with BC, contralateral RRM should not routinely be of fered but may be considered based on personalized risk assessment using a\nmodel such as CanRisk, the competing risk of first cancer prognosis, and shared medical decision making.\nFor women without a prior diagnosis of breast cancer , bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy should not routinely be of fered but may be considered\nbased on a personalized risk assessment using a model such as CanRisk and shared medical decision making.FEP 2.04.126 Germline Genetic Testing for Gene V ariants Associated With Breast Cancer in Individuals at High Breast Cancer Risk (CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nEducation on modifiable risk factors for cancer is undertaken.\"\n\"For CHEK2 heterozygotes with missense variants, ACMG advises the following:\nIn general, risk and penetrance are reduced compared with CHEK2 truncating variants, and in isolation, they are unlikely to reach a level of\nclinical actionability ,\nalthough some exceptions may exist, such as p.(Arg1 17Gly).\nBreast cancer , colorectal cancer , and prostate cancer surveillance should not be based on CHEK2 status but rather on personalized risk\nassessment, including family history and other risk factors, and joint decision making is encouraged.\nEducation on modifiable risk factors for cancer is undertaken.\"\nAmerican College of Radiology\nThe American College of Radiology (ACR) has established Appropriateness Criteria for breast cancer screening (T able 1).49, This includes high-risk\nwomen with a BRCA  gene mutation and their untested first-degree relatives, women with a history of chest irradiation between 10 to 30 years of age,\nand women with 20% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer as follows:\nTable 1. American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for Breast Cancer Screening in High-Risk W omen\nScreening Procedure Appropriateness Category\nMammography Usually appropriate\nDBT Usually appropriate\nBreast MRI without and with IV contrast Usually appropriate\nBreast US May be appropriate (Disagreement)\nMammography with IV contrast May be appropriate (Disagreement)\nSestamibi MBI Usually not appropriate\nBreast MRI without IV contrast Usually not appropriate\nDBT: digital breast tomosynthesis; FDG-PEM: flurodeoxyglucose positron emission mammography; IV : intravenous; MBI: molecular breast imaging; MRI: magnetic resonance  \nimaging; US: ultrasound. \nSpecific recommendations for CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1  variant carriers are not available.\nAmerican Society of Breast Surgeons\nA consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer was updated in February 2019.50, Guidelines state that genetic testing should be\nmade available to all individuals with a personal history of breast cancer and that such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2  and PALB2 , with other\ngenes as appropriate for the clinical scenario and patient family history . Furthermore, individuals who had previous genetic testing may benefit from\nupdated testing. Finally , genetic testing should be made available to individuals without a personal history of breast cancer when they meet National\nComprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline criteria. The guidelines also note that variants of uncertain significance are not clinically actionable.\nFor individuals with mutations in ATM and CHEK2 , enhanced screening is recommended, however , the data are not suf ficient to support risk-reducing\nmastectomy in the absence of other factors such as strong family history . For individuals with BARD1  mutations, evidence is insuf ficient  to support\nchange in breast cancer risk management based on the presence of a  mutation alone.\n FEP 2.04.126 Germline Genetic Testing for Gene V ariants Associated With Breast Cancer in Individuals at High Breast Cancer Risk (CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\n \nAmerican Society of Clinical Oncology and Society of Surgical Oncology\nIn 2024, the  American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Society of Surgical Oncology published recommendations on germline genetic testing\nin individuals with breast cancer .51, The recommendations included the following relevant statements:\n\"Recommendation 4.2.  Testing for moderate penetrance breast cancer genes currently of fers no benefits for treatment of the index breast cancer but\nmay inform risks of second primary cancer or family risk assessment, and thus may be of fered to appropriate patients who are undergoing BRCA1 /2\ntesting (T ype: Formal Consensus; Agreement: 87.50%).\"\n\"Recommendation 4.3.  If a multi-gene panel is ordered, the specific panel chosen should take into account the patient's personal and family history .\nConsultation with a provider experienced in clinical cancer genetics can be helpful in selecting a specific multi-gene panel or interpreting its results and\nshould be made available to patients when possible (T ype: Formal Consensus; Agreement: 91.43%).\"\nThe document further states, \"Other breast cancer susceptibility genes are often considered for testing. The particular genes included on breast cancer\nsusceptibility gene panels varies between testing laboratories. Almost all include ATM, CHEK2 , and PALB2 . These genes do not currently have direct\nrelevance for treatment of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer as P ARP inhibitors are not approved for treatment of individuals with germline\nPVs in any of these genes, and contralateral risks are modest at best. Affected women with PVs in these genes may be at suf ficient risk to benefit from\nbreast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening and PALB2  is linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer that may warrant post-menopausal\nsalpingo-oophorectomy . The major benefit of testing for these genes, however , is to inform risk assessment of family members.\"51,\nAlso in 2024, ASCO published a consensus guideline on the selection of germline genetic testing panels in individuals with cancer .52, The document\nincluded a list of genes recommended for testing and inclusion in multigene panels. For breast cancer , the more strongly recommended genes (higher\nrelative risk of cancer or highly actionable) were BRCA1 , BRCA2 , PALB2 , CDH1 , PTEN , STK1 1, and TP53 . Less strongly recommended genes\n(moderate risk of cancer or potential impact for therapy/change in medical management) were ATM,BARD1, CHEK2, RAD51C, RAD51D , and NF1.\nNational Comprehensive Cancer Network\nThe NCCN (v .3. 2024) guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk assessment for breast and ovarian cancer review single-gene tests for CHEK2, ATM, and\nBARD1 .53, The guidelines state that for those that meet hereditary cancer testing criteria, testing for a specific familial pathogenic/likely pathogenic\nvariant may be recommended for appropriate genes. For individuals who meet criteria with no known familial variants, comprehensive testing of a\nmultigene panel may be considered. This testing may consider a number of genes, including but not limited to CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1.  However , the\ninclusion of certain genes in the guideline does not imply the endorsement \"for or against multigene testing for moderate-penetrance genes\" and there\nare limited data on the degree of cancer risk associated with some genes in multigene panels. Testing an af fected family member first has the highest\nlikelihood of a positive result. The guidelines state that the panel recommends an annual mammogram for women with CHEK2 , ATM, or BARD1\nmutations beginning at age 40, with consideration of annual breast magnetic resonance imaging. The guidelines also state there is insuf ficient\nevidence to draw conclusions on risk-reducing mastectomy in individuals with CHEK2 , ATM, or BARD1  mutations and that patients should be managed\nbased on family history .\nThe NCCN guidelines on breast cancer screening and diagnosis ( v .2.2024)54, recommend the following:\nAnnual mammogram.\nAnnual breast magnetic resonance imaging if the patient has >20% risk of breast cancer based on models largely dependent on family history .\nConsideration of risk-reducing strategies based on family history .\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNo U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1  variant testing have been identified.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.FEP 2.04.126 Germline Genetic Testing for Gene V ariants Associated With Breast Cancer in Individuals at High Breast Cancer Risk (CHEK2, ATM, and BARD1)\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Genes included in this policy are those associated with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndromes that have been shown to have\nhigh penetrance, meaning that a large proportion of individuals with certain mutations in the gene will develop the disorder .\nGenetic testing for cancer susceptibility may be approached by a focused method that involves testing for well-characterized mutations based on a clinical\nsuspicion of which gene(s) may be the cause of the familial cancer . Panel testing involves testing for multiple mutations in multiple genes at one time.\nSeveral companies of fer genetic testing panels for assessing risk of hereditary cancers that use next generation sequencing methods. Next generation\nsequencing refers to one of several methods that use massively parallel platforms to allow the sequencing of large numbers of DNA  segments. Panel\ntesting is potentially associated with greater ef ficiencies in evaluating genetic diseases; however , it may provide information on genetic variants of unclear\nclinical significance, or which would not lead to changes in patient management.\nFDA approval is not currently required for these genetic tests. Clinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house (\"home-brew\") and market them\nas a laboratory service. The laboratory of fering the service must be licensed by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) for high-complexity\ntesting.\nGenetic Counseling\nDetermining the appropriateness of genetic testing for a particular individual can be complex due to the many personal and family history factors that must\nbe taken into consideration to determine which, if any , test is appropriate. Interpretation of test results and discussion of the possible health implications for\nthe patient and family members are also important considerations. \nDefinitions\nClose Blood Relative:  for the purposes of this policy , a relative is someone who is related by blood; a first-, second-, or third-degree relative from the same\nside of the family .\nFirst degree relative:   A family member who shares about 50 percent of their genes with a particular individual in a family . First degree relatives\ninclude parents, of fspring, and siblings.\nSecond degree relative:   A family member who shares about 25 percent of their genes with a particular individual in a family . Second degree\nrelatives include grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and half-siblings.\nThird degree relative :  A family member who shares about one-eighth of their genes, such as first cousins, great-grandparents, great-aunts, great-\nuncles.\nUnaffected Member\nThe purpose of this genetic testing is to help inform a person's likelihood of developing a specific condition. Increased risk of developing a condition, or of\npassing on a genetic condition to their children. Testing should be considered in appropriate individuals where it is likely to impact the risk management\nand/or treatment of the tested individuals and/or their family members who also have increased risk. For the purpose of this policy , an unaf fected member is\none that has no personal history of breast and/or ovarian cancer and has not had testing to determine if genetic variants increase their risk of developing\nbreast and/or ovarian cancer . \nAffected Family Member\nFor the purpose of this policy , an af fected family member is one that has a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer or has a history of another cancer that\nthereby increases the risk of the development of breast and/or ovarian cancer (i.e. fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , pancreatic cancer , or\nprostate cancer) Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota Medical Policy25. 4. 8. 오후  4:05 VI-16-014\nhttps://securecms.bluecrossmnonline.com/content/medpolicy/en/minnesota/core/all/policies/Laboratory/VI-16/VI-16-011111.html 1/7\n\nGleason score  is the preferred system for histopathological grading of prostate cancer . The score reflects the dif ferentiation of cells in primary and\nsecondary patterns. The combined scores from each pattern may range from 2-10. A Gleason score of 7 indicates a moderately aggressive tumor with\nintermediate dif ferentiation. A score of 8 or greater indicates poorly dif ferentiated or undif ferentiated cells and a more aggressive tumor .\nLynch Syndrome-related cancers include colorectal, endometrial, gastric, ovarian, exocrine pancreatic, upper tract urothelial, glioblastoma, biliary tract,\nand small intestinal cancers.\nGermline: Hereditary variant identified through a blood or saliva sample.\nThis policy is designed to address medical guidelines that are appropriate for the majority of individuals with a particular disease, illness, or condition.

About 1 in 400-500 people in the general population has a BRCA1 or\nBRCA2 mutation. The prevalence of mutations is higher in people of Norwegian, Dutch, Greenland, or Icelandic ethnicity . The prevalence of BRCA\nmutations varies among African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and non-Hispanic whites. About 1 in 40 people of Ashkenazi Jewish\nancestry has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Most of the risk in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is associated with three common founder mutations,\ntwo of which are in the BRCA1 gene and one in the BRCA2 gene. People with a BRCA  mutation have an increased risk of various types of cancer .\nUp to 10% of all breast cancer and 15% of all ovarian cancer is associated with an inherited gene mutation, with BRCA1 and BRCA2 accounting for\nabout 20-25% of all hereditary cases. As additional genes and cancers are linked to the risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer , multigene\npanel testing has increased. \nRationale\nIndividuals and/or families with HBOC may have the following histories of cancer or other characteristics:\nbreast cancer ata  young age, typically under 50\nmultiple breast primaries in one individual and/or family memebers (on the same side of the family)\ntriple negative breast cancer (ER-, PR-, HER2-)\novarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal can cer\nmetastatic (radiographic evidence of or biopsy-proven disease)\nintraductal/cribriform histology , high-risk, or very-high-risk group prostate cancer as defined by NCCN\nmale breast cancer\nexocrine pancreatic cancer\nmultiple cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer in a family or one individual with breast and ovarian cancer\na confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer and a family history of ovarian, breast, prostate, or pancreatic cancer\npreviously identified germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation in the family , or\nany of the above with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry . \nHBOC due to a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 is an autosomal dominant disorder . In autosomal dominant inheritance, individuals have 2 copies of\nthe gene and only one mutation is required to cause disease. When a parent has a mutation, each of fspring has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutation.\nMales and females are equally likely to be af fected.. The diagnosis is established by the identification of a pathogenic mutation in a gene associated\nwith HBOC. Screening and prevention options are available to specifically address the increased risk of these cancers in a person with a BRCA\nmutation. BRCA  testing may include known familial mutation anslysis. Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation analysis, next generation sequencing,\nand/or deletion/duplication analysis. 25. 4. 8. 오후  4:05 VI-16-014\nhttps://securecms.bluecrossmnonline.com/content/medpolicy/en/minnesota/core/all/policies/Laboratory/VI-16/VI-16-011111.html 4/7\n\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (2019) issued a statement regarding BRCA1/2 testing in all individuals with breast cancer:\n“With the advances in sequencing technologies and increasing access to and expanding indications for genetic testing, it remains critical to ensure\nthat implementation of testing is based on evidence. Currently , there is insuf ficient evidence to recommend genetic testing for BRCA1/2 alone or in\ncombination with multi-gene panels for all breast cancer patients.”\nThe American Society of Breast Surgeons (2019) published a consensus guideline on genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer . They stated the\nfollowing: \"Breast surgeons, genetic counselors, and other medical professionals knowledgeable in genetic testing can provide patient education and\ncounseling and make recommendations to their patients regarding genetic testing and arrange testing. When the patient’ s history and/or test results\nare complex, referral to a certified genetic counselor or genetics professional may be useful. Genetic testing is increasingly provided through multi-\ngene panels. There are a wide variety of panels available, with dif ferent genes on dif ferent panels. There is a lack of consensus among experts\nregarding which genes should be tested in dif ferent clinical scenarios. There is also variation in the degree of consensus regarding the understanding\nof risk and appropriate clinical management of mutations in some genes. Genetic testing should be made available to all patients with a personal\nhistory of breast cancer . Recent data supports the idea that genetic testing should be of fered to each patient with breast cancer (newly diagnosed or\nwith a personal history). If genetic testing is performed, such testing should include BRCA1/BRCA2 and P ALB2, with other genes as appropriate for\nthe clinical scenario and family history . For patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer , identification of a mutation may impact local treatment\nrecommendations (surgery and potentially radiation) and systemic therapy . Additionally , family members may subsequently be of fered testing and\ntailored risk reduction strategies. Patients who had genetic testing previously may benefit from updated testing. Every patient being seen by a breast\nsurgeon, who had genetic testing in the past and no pathogenic variant was identified, should be re-evaluated and updated testing considered. In\nparticular , a patient who had negative germline BRCA1 and 2 testing, who is from a family with no pathogenic variants, should be considered for\nadditional testing. Genetic testing performed prior to 2014 most likely would not have had P ALB2 or other potentially relevant genes included and\nmay not have included testing for large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Genetic testing should be made available to patients without\na history of breast cancer who meet NCCN guidelines. Unaf fected patients should be informed that testing an af fected relative first, whenever\npossible, is more informative than undergoing testing themselves. When it is not feasible to test the af fected relative first, then the unaf fected family\nmember should be considered for testing if they are interested, with careful pre-test counseling to explain the limited value of “uninformative\nnegative” results. It is also reasonable to order a multi-gene panel if the family history is incomplete (i.e., a case of adoption, patient is uncertain of\nexact type of cancer af fecting family members, among others) or other cancers are found in the family history , as described above.\"\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023) evidence and consensus-based guidelines addressed test indications for BRCA  testing. These\nguidelines included recommendations related to unaf fected individuals with a family history of cancer , those with a known mutation in the family ,\nthose with a personal history of breast cancer , exocrine pancreatic cancer , ovarian cancer , a confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer , and men with\nbreast cancer . They take into consideration age of diagnosis, tumor pathology , degree of relationship, and Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry .\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2019) recommendations addressed women with a personal and/or family history of breast cancer and/or\novarian, tubal, or primary peritoneal cancer . The USPSTF guideline recommended: “When a woman's personal or family history of cancer is\nconsistent with a BRCA1/2 mutation: “that primary care clinicians assess women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or\nperitoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with breast cancer susceptibility 1 and 2 (BRCA1/2) gene mutations with an appropriate brief\nfamilial risk assessment tool. W omen with a positive result on the risk assessment tool should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after\ncounseling, genetic testing. When a woman's personal or family history is not consistent with a BRCA1/2 mutation: “recommends against routine risk\nassessment, genetic counseling, or genetic testing for women whose personal or family history or ancestry is not associated with potentially harmful\nBRCA1/2 gene mutations. Genetic risk assessment and BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a multistep process that begins with identifying patients with\nfamily or personal histories of breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer; family members with known harmful BRCA1/2 mutations; or ancestry\nassociated with harmful BRCA1/2 mutations. Risk for clinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations can be further evaluated with genetic counseling by\nsuitably trained health care clinicians, followed by genetic testing of selected high-risk individuals and posttest counseling about results. The type of\nmutation analysis required depends on family history . Individuals from families with known mutations or from ancestry groups in which certain\nmutations are more common (eg, Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations) can be tested for these specific mutations.\"\n \nReference List\n1.

Intellectual disability (ID, formerly \nreferred to as mental retardation) is \"a disability characterized by significant limitations \nin both intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, \nsocial and practical adaptive skills.\"1 Global developmental delay (GDD) categorizes \nyounger children (typically less than 5 years of age) who have significant delay \n(characterized as performance two standard deviations or more below the mean on \nage-appropriate, standardized, normal-referenced testing) in two or more \ndevelopmental domains, including gross or fine motor, speech and language, cognitive,\nsocial and personal, and activities of daily living.2 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

With current diagnostic criteria, these categories were\nsubsumed under the diagnosis of ASD.\nSymptom onset is in early childhood (typically before 3 years of age).6,7 ASD is often \naccompanied by intellectual disability, behavioral difficulties, and/or sensory \nabnormalities. \nID and GDD may present in infancy or early childhood. ID is assessed in three \ndomains: intelligence (IQ), adaptive behavior, and systems of supports the individual \nrequires.1 Children with GDD have significant delay in two or more developmental \ndomains. Young children with GDD may later be diagnosed with ID and/or ASD.2,4 \nThere are both syndromic and non-syndromic forms of inherited ASD, ID, and GDD. \nThe constellation of associated findings is highly dependent on the underlying etiology. \nClinical information (e.g. presence of specific congenital malformations, dysmorphic \nfeatures, and other symptoms) may be used in some cases to help narrow down the \nsuspected cause. In these cases, it may be possible to identify a narrow subset of \ngenes that may be responsible for an individual's neurodevelopmental concerns.\nCause \nASD, ID, and GDD can develop secondary to head injury, birth complication, endocrine\ndisorder (e.g., hypothyroidism), toxic exposure (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome), inborn \nerror of metabolism (e.g., phenylketonuria), and central nervous system infection.2,6,7 \nThere are also many known genetic conditions that are associated with an increased \nrisk for ASD, ID, and GDD. A thorough clinical genetics evaluation is estimated to result\nin an identified cause in 30–40% of affected individuals with ASD.6 Chromosome \nmicroarray analysis was previously thought to have the highest diagnostic yield of any \nsingle test for these disorders, with an estimated detection rate of at least 10-20% for \nASD, ID, and GDD (often grouped together as neurodevelopmental disorders, or \nNDDs).4,6,8,9 Whole exome and genome sequencing have more recently been \ndemonstrated to have diagnostic yields of up to 35% for those with NDDs and \npotentially higher for those with other comorbidities such as epilepsy or congenital \nanomalies.9 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Inherited forms of these disorders can show autosomal dominant, autosomal \nrecessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial patterns of inheritance. \nDiagnosis \nASD, ID, and GDD are diagnosed through the evaluation of an individual's \ndevelopment and behaviors by an appropriate specialist (such as neurodevelopmental \npediatrician or developmental-behavioral pediatrician). Medical tests such as hearing \nscreening, vision screening, and neurological evaluations may also be performed.2,5 A \ndiagnosis of ASD and/or ID is often difficult to establish in infants and very young \nchildren, as the standardized methods used for diagnosis are less reliable in children \nunder the age of 5 years; the term \"global developmental delay\" is thus used to \ncategorize these individuals.2 Identifying an underlying genetic etiology for an \nindividual's NDD cannot provide a diagnosis of ASD versus ID versus a specific \nlearning disability.\nManagement \nManagement for ASD includes behavioral interventions such as applied behavioral \nanalysis (ABA) therapy, structured educational interventions, and in some cases, \npharmacotherapy.6,7 NDDs are also managed with therapies and educational \nintervention plans tailored to the individual's needs. In a limited number of cases \n(mostly metabolic disorders), knowing the genetic mutation that is responsible for a \nneurodevelopmental disorder can help to guide management. Identifying a genetic \nsyndrome may also alert the healthcare team to potential comorbidities for which \nevaluation and surveillance may be needed.\nSurvival \nWhile life expectancy in autism may be reported as reduced, this is often secondary to \naccidents such as drowning.3 With the exception of individuals with multiple disabilities \n(such as Down syndrome), the life expectancy of individuals with intellectual disability \nis now similar to that of the general population.10 Comorbid conditions can also affect \nsurvival in these disorders.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nTesting for ASD, ID, and GDD may include known familial mutation analysis, single \ngene sequence analysis, single gene deletion/duplication analysis, or multi-gene \npanels of various sizes. \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 9 of 17\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Autism                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nKnown Familial Mutation (KFM) Testing \nKnown familial mutations analysis is performed when a causative mutation has been \nidentified in a close biological relative of the individual requesting testing. Analysis for \nknown familial mutations typically includes only the single mutation. However, if \navailable, a targeted mutation panel that includes the familial mutation may be \nperformed.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries. Promoter regions and intronic sequences may also be sequenced if \ndisease-causing mutations are known to occur in these regions of a gene.\nDeletion and Duplication Analysis \nAnalysis for deletions and duplications can be performed using a variety of technical \nplatforms including exon array, Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification \n(MLPA), and NGS data analysis. These assays detect gains and losses too large to be \nidentified through standard sequence analysis, often single or multiple exons or whole \ngenes.\nMulti-Gene Testing Panels \nThe efficiency of NGS has led to an increasing number of large, multi-gene testing \npanels. NGS panels that test several genes at once are particularly well-suited to \nconditions caused by more than one gene or where there is considerable clinical \noverlap between conditions making it difficult to reliably narrow down likely causes. \nAdditionally, tests should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of identifying mutations \nin the genes of interest, contribute to alterations in management for an individual, and/\nor minimize the chance of finding variants of uncertain clinical significance. \nASD, ID and GDD multi-gene panels include a wide variety of genes: from a few to \nhundreds or even thousands. These disorders may also be grouped together in broad \n\"neurodevelopmental\" panels. Multi-gene panels may also include genes believed to \nbe associated with disease (e.g. \"susceptibility\" genes), but with a lower impact on risk \nthan recognized syndromes. Results for such genes are of less clear value because \nthere often are not clear management recommendations for mutation-positive \nindividuals.\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Seizure \ntypes include generalized seizures (absence seizures, tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic \nseizures), focal seizures (simple focal seizures, complex focal seizures, secondary \ngeneralized seizures, among others), and seizures for which the type is unknown. \nEpilepsy syndromes can be associated with generalized, focal, or combined \ngeneralized and focal seizures, and can have onset in childhood or adulthood.2 \nEpilepsy syndromes may be associated with developmental and/or epileptic \nencephalopathy (childhood onset) or progressive neurological deterioration (later \nonset).2 \nCause \nEpilepsy has multiple causes, including central nervous system infection, autoimmune \ndisease, structural brain abnormalities, brain tumors, and head trauma.3 There are also\nnumerous genetic conditions associated with epilepsy. It is estimated that \napproximately 40% of individuals with seizures have an underlying genetic basis for \ntheir condition (see Table 1 for a list of common genetic causes).4 Factors that \ncontribute to the likelihood of a genetic basis includes type of seizures (focal or \ngeneralized) or epilepsy syndromes (such as epileptic encephalopathy), age of onset, \nfamily history, and presence of other clinical features.\nThrough Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based testing, including multi-gene \npanels, whole exome and genome sequencing as well as whole-genome screening for \nCNVs, pathogenic sequence variants have been identified in about 30-40% and \ndeletions or duplications in ~5-10% of patients with a range of epilepsy phenotypes, \nincluding focal epilepsy, generalized epilepsies, epileptic encephalopathies, fever-\nassociated epilepsy syndromes, other epilepsy syndromes, and patients with \nneurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.5,6 \n©2024 eviCore healthcare. All Rights Reserved. 11 of 20\n400 Buckwalter Place Boulevard, Bluffton, SC 29910 (800) 918-8924 www.eviCore.com \n          Epilepsy                    \n\nLab Management Guidelines V1.0.2025\nThere are many different epilepsy syndromes, including generalized epilepsy \nsyndromes, focal epilepsy syndromes, combined generalized and focal epilepsy \nsyndromes, epilepsy syndromes with developmental and/or epileptic encephalopathy \n(DEE). These syndromes can present at variable ages ranging from neonatal to \nadulthood.2,7 \nDEE is a group of disorders in which seizures are accompanied by developmental \ndelays, cognitive impairment, or a host of other neurological issues such as feeding \ndifficulties, sleep dysregulation, and behavioral problems.8 Knowledge regarding the \ngenetic basis of these disorders has increased significantly in the last decade due to \nthe advent of high throughput NGS methods, resulting in wider availability of multi-gene\npanel testing. The following are examples of epileptic encephalopathies:\nOhtahara Syndrome (Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy)\no“Characterized by early onset intractable tonic spasms, suppression-burst \npattern on interictal EEG, and poor prognosis.”  9 \no“To date various genes, which have essential roles in the brain’s neuronal and \ninterneuronal functions, have been reported to be associated with Ohtahara \nsyndrome. For instance, syntaxin binding protein 1 (STXBP1) regulates synaptic\nvesicle release; aristaless-related homeobox (ARX) acts as a regulator of \nproliferation and differentiation of neuronal progenitors; solute carrier family 25 \nmember 22 (SLC25A22) encodes a mitochondrial glutamate transporter13; and \npotassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 2 (KCNQ2) plays\na key role in a cell’s ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.”  10 \nDravet Syndrome (Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy)\no“Clinical cardinal features include febrile or afebrile generalized or \nhemiconvulsions starting in the first year of life, seizure evolution to a mixture of \nintractable generalized (myoclonic or atonic seizures, atypical absences) and \nfocal seizures, normal early development, subsequent psychomotor retardation, \nand normal brain imaging at onset.”  9 \no“In most of the cases with Dravet syndrome, one single gene has been involved,\nin contrast to other epileptic encephalopathy syndromes. SCN1A mutations \nhave been shown in at least 80% of patients with Dravet syndrome.”  10 \nInfantile Spasms (West Syndrome and X-linked Infantile Spasms)\no“West syndrome is characterized by a specific seizure type, i.e., epileptic \nspasms, a unique interictal EEG pattern termed hypsarrhythmia, and \npsychomotor retardation. Spasms start within the first year of life, mainly \nbetween 4 and 6 months of age.”  9 \no“There are multiple genetic determinants of infantile spasms, which are usually \nexplained by mutations in distinct genes. Genetic analysis of children with \nunexplained infantile spasms have demonstrated mutations on the X \nchromosome in genes such as ARX, cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), \nand UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit (ALG13) as well as de novo \n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Seizure, cognitive, and \npsychiatric phenotypes show heterogeneity. Seizures start from the age of 6 to \n36 months and may be precipitated by fever. Seizure types include GTCS, \nmyoclonic and tonic seizures, absences, and focal.”  9 \no“Different mutations of PCDH19 (protocadherin 19), including missense, \nnonsense, and frameshift mutations, have been reported as the cause of \nEFMR.” 9 \nInheritance \nInheritance patterns differ between various epilepsy syndromes, and include \nmonogenic inheritance patterns such as dominant, X-linked, recessive, and \nmitochondrial, in addition to epilepsy caused by de novo (i.e. new) genetic mutations. \nClinical heterogeneity is also seen in these conditions.\nDiagnosis \nAn electroencephalograph (EEG) can be used to help diagnose epilepsy and possibly \ngive information as to the seizure type. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \nscan can further help define whether epilepsy is caused by a structural brain \nabnormality or help determine the origin of epilepsy. \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is complicated by many factors. Epilepsy syndromes \nfrequently have overlapping features, such as the types of seizures involved and/or \nadditional clinical findings. Many (if not most) epilepsy syndromes, including epileptic \nencephalopathy, are genetically heterogeneous, and can be caused by mutations in a \nnumber of different genes. Sometimes, the inheritance pattern or the presence of \npathognomonic features makes the underlying syndrome clear. However, in many \ncases, it can be difficult to reliably diagnose a genetic epilepsy syndrome based on \nclinical and family history alone.\nNGS-based testing has been shown to dramatically improve the diagnostic rate for \nchildren and adults with epilepsy, as well as significantly shorten the time from \nassessment to diagnosis.11-13 The diagnostic yield of NGS in patients with epilepsy is \nestimated to be 20-40%.6,14,15 \nClinical information (e.g. age of onset, seizure type, EEG results, etc.) or family history \nmay be used in some cases to help narrow down the suspected cause. In these cases,\n©2024 eviCore healthcare.

Not all \ntreatments will work for everyone and often, it takes multiple treatment trials to find a \nregimen that is successful. Refractory epilepsy is diagnosed after two or more AEDs \nhave failed to control seizures. Drug-resistant epilepsy is defined as \"failure of \nadequate trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen and used AED schedules \n(whether as monotherapies or in combination) to achieve sustained seizure freedom\".16\nIn a rapidly growing number of epilepsy disorders, knowing the genetic mutation that is \nresponsible for the epilepsy has been shown to help guide management and provide \nmore disease-specific treatment.17,18 \nSurvival \nLifespan is dependent upon seizure control and the underlying cause of the individual's\nepilepsy.\nTest information \nIntroduction \nGenetic testing for epilepsy may consist of next-generation sequencing or multigene \npanels.\nNext Generation Sequencing Assay \nNext generation sequencing (NGS), which is also sometimes called massively parallel \nsequencing, was developed in 2005 to allow larger scale and more efficient gene \nsequencing. NGS relies on sequencing many copies of small pieces of DNA \nsimultaneously and using bioinformatics to assemble the sequence. Sequence analysis\ndetects single nucleotide substitutions and small (several nucleotide) deletions and \ninsertions. Regions analyzed typically include the coding sequence and intron/exon \nboundaries.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their\nhealth care providers. The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

There are a variety of causes of DCM, including genetic and nongenetic conditions. Genetic forms of DCM are heterogeneous in their\nmolecular basis and clinical expression. Genetic testing for DCM has potential utility for confirming a diagnosis of genetic DCM and as a prognostic test\nin family members when familial DCM is present.\nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to examine whether genetic testing improves net health outcomes in individuals with suspected dilated\ncardiomyopathy and in asymptomatic individuals who have a relative with dilated cardiomyopathy and a known familial variant.\n \nPOLICY  STATEMENT\nComprehensive genetic testing for individuals with signs or symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy , which is considered idiopathic after a negative\nworkup for secondary causes, is considered medically necessary .\nTargeted genetic testing for asymptomatic individuals with a first-degree relative who has dilated cardiomyopathy and a known familial variant is\nconsidered medically necessary .\nGenetic testing for dilated cardiomyopathy is considered investigational  in all other situations.FEP 2.04.1 14 Genetic Testing for Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\n \nPOLICY  GUIDELINES\nStandard W orkup for Patients W ith Signs or Symptoms of Dilated Cardiomyopathy\nThe standard workup for patients with signs or symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) includes a clinical exam, blood pressure monitoring,\nelectrocardiography , echocardiography , and workup for coronary artery disease as warranted by risk factors. An extensive workup including cardiac\nmagnetic resonance imaging, exercise testing, right-sided catheterization with biopsy , and 24-hour electrocardiography monitoring will uncover only a\nsmall number of additional etiologies for DCM.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It was implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (T able PG1). The Society's nomenclature is\nrecommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human  Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology<97>\"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign”<97>to describe\nvariants identified that cause Mendelian disorders.\nTable PG1.

They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nGenetic Counseling\nGenetic counseling is primarily aimed at patients who are at risk for inherited disorders, and experts recommend formal genetic counseling in most\ncases when genetic testing for an inherited condition is considered. The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered. Please see Section 6 General exclusions.\nBenefits are available for specialized diagnostic genetic testing when it is medically necessary to diagnose and/or manage a patient's existing medical\ncondition. Benefits are not provided for genetic panels when some or all of the tests included in the panel are not covered, are experimental or\ninvestigational, or are not medically necessary .\n \nFDA REGULA TORY STATUS\nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service; laboratory-developed tests must meet the\ngeneral regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be\nlicensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this\ntest.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who have signs and/or symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) who receive comprehensive genetic testing, the evidence includes\nlarge case series reporting clinical validity and prospective observational studies reporting clinical utility . Relevant outcomes are overall survival, test\nvalidity , symptoms, change in disease status, functional outcomes, quality of life, and treatment-related morbidity . The percentage of patients with\nidiopathic DCM who have a genetic variant (clinical sensitivity) is relatively low , in the range of 10% to 40%. Additional studies assessed clinical\noutcomes of patients with DCM and at least 1 known variant compared with patients with DCM and no known variants. The studies reported that\npatients with DCM and known variants experienced lower event-free survival, earlier onset of symptoms, lower transplant-free survival, and more life-\nthreatening arrhythmias compared with patients with DCM and no known variants. A prospective observational study has reported that patients with\nDCM and known variants experienced high rates of morbidity and mortality during 4 to 8 years of follow-up. While direct evidence of clinical usefulness\nis lacking, confirming a diagnosis can lead to changes in clinical management, which improve net health outcomes. Changes in management may\ninclude earlier implantation of cardiac defibrillators or increased surveillance to detect worsening of symptoms, as well as cascade genetic testing of\nasymptomatic family members. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are asymptomatic with a first-degree relative who has DCM and a known familial variant who receive targeted genetic testing for a\nknown familial variant, the evidence includes retrospective studies and case series reporting clinical value and a prospective observational study\nreporting clinical utility . Relevant outcomes are test validity , symptoms, morbid events, functional outcomes, quality of life, and treatment-related\nmorbidity . For an individual at-risk due to genetic DCM in the family , genetic testing can identify whether a familial variant has been inherited. A\nprospective observational study with 4 to 8 years of follow-up reported the development of cardiac symptoms among patients initially asymptomatic\nwho had DCM-related variants. While direct evidence of clinical usefulness is lacking, confirming a diagnosis can lead to changes in clinical\nmanagement, which improve net health outcomes. Changes in management may include periodic clinical and cardiovascular evaluations to detect the\nearliest signs of disease, as well as genetic counseling. The evidence is suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net\nhealth outcome.FEP 2.04.1 14 Genetic Testing for Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Referral to centers expert in genetic\nevaluation and family-based management should be considered (Level of Evidence B).”\n\"Genetic testing should be considered for the one most clearly af fected person in a family to facilitate screening and management.”\n\"Genetic and family counseling is recommended for all patients and families with cardiomyopathy (Level of Evidence A).”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination.

Scientific Background  \nCardiomyopathies  \nIn 1995, the WHO divided cardiomyopathies into five categories:  dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) , \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) , restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) , arrhythmogenic right \nventricular  cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) , and unclassified cardiomy opathies . Cardiomyopathies \nhave a variety of genotypes and phenotypes that typically require echocardiographic evaluation . Either \nphase of the heartbeat (systole or diastole) may be affected . \nSystolic dysfunction is usually characterized by a decrease in myocardial contractility. This decrease \ncauses a reduction in the ejection fraction of the left ventricle (LV), thereby forcing one of two \ncompensatory mechanisms ; either the LV  itself increases in size (leading to larger stroke volume) or the \ncontractility of the heart increases in response to increased stretch. However, these compensatory \nmechanisms will eventually fail,  leading to physiological manifestations of heart failure.  This dysfunction \nis often seen in DCM, as well as some HCM patients . \nDiastolic dysfunction refers to abnormal LV relaxation and filling, as well as elevated filling pressures.  As \nwith systolic dysfunction, the primary issue with diastole is caused by abno rmal contractility of the heart \nmuscle. The contractility of the myocardium influences both the LV relaxation phase  (the isovolumetric \nperiod between the aortic valve’s close and mitral valve’s opening)  and passive compliance phase  \n(variable pressure, starting at mitral valve’s opening)  of diastole. Due to the impaired contractility of the \nmyocardium, the pressure  in each phase is abnormal. Dysfunction in this phase is often seen in HCM, \nRCM, and  DCM . \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)  \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a commonly inherited cardiovascular disease defined as \nthickening of the ventricular wall resulting from more than 1500 mutations in 11 or more genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere.  \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH, thickness of ≥15 mm), observed by echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging and not otherwise explainable by other cardiovascular issues, such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease, and \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 6 of 35 \ncongenital heart disease. Development of LVH usually starts in adolescence and is complete by early \nadulthood. Symptoms include chest pain, dyspnea and syncope, and severe disease can lead to disabling complicat ions, including heart failure and malignant ventricular arrhythmias. However, many patients \nwith HCM are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms and are only discovered through means such \nas family screenings or an abnormal ECG. HCM is the most frequent caus e of sudden death in young \npeople and can lead to functional disability from heart failure and stroke.  HCM is a relatively common \nfinding with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 500 people.  However, estimates of clinically expressed \nHCM plus gene carriers are as high as 1 in 200.  \nM\nore than 90% of HCM is inherited as an autosomal\n-d\nominant disease with variable expressivity and \nage-re\nlated penetrance. Currently, relevant genetic abnormalities can be detected in approximately 60 \npercent of patients with clinically documented HCM. Most of the genetic mutations associated with HCM are found in the genes encoding various proteins that make up the cardiac sarcomere, the basic \ncontractile unit of cardiac myocytes.\n More than 1500 pathogenic variants have been identified in at least \n11 different genes. Mutations in myosin heavy chain ( MYH7 ) and myosin- binding protein C ( MYBPC3 ) \nare the most common and account for roughly 70 percent of HCM. Other genes implicated in HCM are regulatory myosin light chain ( MYL2) and cardiac troponin T ( TNNT2 ). Non -sarcomeric genes encoding \nplasma membrane or mitochondrial proteins, or Z\n-d\nisc encoding genes, have also been documented.  \nW\nide phenotypic variability exists, ranging from asymptomatic to severe life -threatening heart failure \neven  within the same mutation. This variability in clinical expression may be related to environmental \nfactors and modifier genes. Moreover, no  strong correlation between left ventricular problems and \nsymptoms  exists ; patients with major obstructions or hypert rophy may be asymptomatic and vice versa. \nThe primary characteristic of LVH is present in multiple conditions , such as systemic hypertension, Fabry \ndisease, aortic stenosis, and more. Such conditions should be excluded before a diagnosis of HCM is made.  \nDiagnostic screening of first -degree relatives is important to identify at risk patients. Guidelines have \nbeen established for clinically unaffected relatives of affected individuals. Clinical screening with physical examination, electrocardiography, and ech ocardiography is recommended every 12 to 18 months for \nindividuals between the ages of 12 to 18 years and every 3 to 5 years for adults with additional screening recommended for any change in symptoms.  \nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)  \nDilated cardiomyopathy (D CM) is characterized by dilation and impaired contraction of one or both \nventricles. The dilation often becomes severe and is invariably accompanied by an increase in total cardiac mass. Affected patients have impaired systolic function and clinical presentation is usually with features of heart failure.  \nDilated cardiomyopathy is caused by a variety of disorders. The cause is unknown for over 50% of patients with the disease. Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by a genetic mutation in 20 -35% \nwith the disease. DCM is transmitted primarily in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Mutations \nin over 30 genes have been determined to cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy.  \nOther common causes for DCM include  coronary heart disease, heart attack, hig h blood pressure, \ndiabetes, thyroid disease, viral hepatitis and HIV, infections, especially viral infections that inflame the heart muscle, alcohol, complications during the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months of birth, certain toxins such as cobal t, certain drugs (such as cocaine and amphetamines) and two medicines used \nto treat cancer (doxorubicin and daunorubicin).   \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 7 of 35 \nGenetic forms of dilated cardiomyopathy are diagnosed by family history and molecular testing. Genes \nassociated with familial dilate d cardiomyopathy include  MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNC1, TNNI3, TPM1, \nMYL2, MYL3, ACTC1, ACTN2, CSRP3, PLN, TTR, PRKG2, LAMP2, GLA, LMNA, BAG3, RBM20, SCN5A, DES, DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP, PKP2, RYR2, TMEM43, and TTN . \nNotably, the frequencies of DCM mutations in any one gene are low (<<1% to 6 -8%), and a genetic cause \nis identified in only 30 -35% of familial DCM cases. Therefore, routine genetic testing for DCM was only \nrecommended in familial disease (≥2 affected family members). However, as molecular genetic testing \nlaboratories offer DCM genetic testing panels of 12 -30 genes utilizing next generation sequencing \nmethods, testing sensitivity now ranges from 15 -25%, has become standard of care.   \nGuidelines now recommend testing for all patients with ca rdiomyopathy even if no other disease is \nevident in the family. Genetic testing is clinically useful in the management of affected individuals, as \nwell as to assess risk in relatives. LMNA  mutations are associated with high rates of conduction system \ndisea se, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death (SCD), and may consequently lower the \nthreshold for prophylactic ICD implantation. DCM patients with a variant of the  SCN5A  gene exhibit a \nphenotype associated with significant arrhythmias and frequent premature ventricular complexes. \nAlthough such patients responded poorly to conventional HF therapy, treatment with sodium channel \nblocking drugs produced a dramatic reduction in ectopy and normalization of left ventricular (LV) \nfunction. \nRestrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)  \nRestrictive cardiomyopathy  (RCM ) differs from other cardiomyopathies in that there may not be many  \nphysical  abnormalities (i.e. , no dilation or hypertrophy). However, the ventricular filling process is still \nsignificantly impaired. RCM may be difficult to see on two -dimensional imaging, and assessment of flow \nvelocity across the mitral valve is more accurate in detecting these filling abnormalities. Some cases of RCM are secondary to a more apparent cardiac condition. However, idiopathic cas es of RCM are \ngenerally genetic conditions. Pathogenic mutations in sarcomeric or cytoskeletal genes such as TNNI3, \nTNNT2,  and TPN1  have been linked to familial RCM .  \nArrhythmogenic right ventricular  cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D)  \nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy  (ARVC ) is characterized by changes in myocardium of \nthe right (and often left as well) ventricular free wall. This myocardium is replaced by fibrous or fibro -\nfatty tissue , causing dysfunction of the affected ventricles . At the molecular level, the desmosomes are \ntypically impaired due to genetic mutations. This causes the mechanical stress of the heart to detach myocytes, which eventually leads to their death. The initial repair mechanisms of this detachment are \nwhat produces  the fibrous tissue . Up to 30% of ARVC cases are familial, and  mutations in gene  products \nsuch as plakoglobin  and desmoplakin  have been associated with ARVC . \nUnclassified Cardiomyopathies  \nOther types of cardiomyopathies  that do not fall into one of the other four categories are considered \n“unclassified .” For example, left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC)  falls in this category due to its \ncharacteristic myocardial wall; the myocardial wall consists of “prominent trabeculae and deep \nintertrabecular recesses ”, thereby resulting in  two layers of myocardium of different thickness. This \ncondition may be sporadi c or familial; up to 50% of LVNC cases are familial. Genes such as a lpha -\ndystrobrevin  or other sarcomeric genes may contribute to LVNC .  \nThis category also includes cardiomyopathies such as s tress -induced cardiomyopathy  and c irrhotic \ncardiomyopathy . \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 8 of 35 \nClinical Utility  and Validity (Cardiomyopathies)  \nA recent study by  Cirino et al. (2017)  compared the results from panel genetic testing to whole genome \nsequencing (WGS). Forty -one patients with HCM who had undergone targeted genetic testing (either \nmultigene panel or familial variant test) were recruited into a clinical trial of WGS. Panel size ranged \nfrom 4 -62 genes, and all but two subjects were tested for the main eight sarcomeric genes ( MYH7, \nMYBPC3, TNNT2, TPM1, MYL2, MYL3, TNNI3, ACTC ). The authors stated that WGS detected nearly all \nvariants identified on panel testing and allowed further analysis of posited disease genes. Several variants of uncertain clinical use and other genetic findings were also identified. Panel testing and WGS provided similar results, but WGS provides reanalysis over time; however, WGS also requires genomic expertise to correctly interpret results.  \nA study focusing on the non -sarcomeric genes contributing to HCM was performed by Walsh et al. \n(2017) . A reference sample of 60,7 06 exomes were analyzed and compared to 6,179 HCM cases. This \ncomparison revealed a large number  of gene variants in the main eight sarcomeric genes ( MYH7, \nMYBPC3, TNNT2, TPM1, MYL2, MYL3, TNNI3, ACTC1) but very few variants of the non -sarcomeric genes \nin HCM cases. The authors concluded the variation in most of the non -sarcomeric genes does not affect \nHCM significantly as 99% of HCM pathogenic variants were found to be in the main eight sarcomeric genes. Four non -sarcomeric genes were found to have an excess of variants, but even these amounted \nto only 2% of the HCM cases overall; the other 26 non -sarcomeric genes examined were found to have \nvery little or no excess variation over the reference sample of exomes. Furthermore, the authors state that only the well-known variants are symptomatic whereas the other variants are of unknown \nsignificance or benign, making clinical sequencing of limited use. The authors recommended that the only genes tested should be the eight sarcomeric genes, the metabolic cardiomy opathy genes, and \npossibly ACTN2 and MYOZ2 .  \nBhonsale et al. (2015)  assessed the impact of genotype on clinical outcomes of ARVC patients. \nPathogenic mutations were evaluated in 577 patients. The investigators found that patients with a desmoplakin- associated mutation had an over four-fold occurrence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction \nand heart failure than PKP2  carriers. No significant difference was found between clinic al outcomes of \npatients with missense mutations and patients with truncating or splice site mutations. Patients with multiple mutations had more severe symptoms, such as lower survival rate without ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, more frequent LV dysfunction, heart failure, cardiac transplant, and earlier \noccurrence of sustained v entricular fibrillation and tachycardia, as compared to those with only one \nmutation.  \nKostareva et al. (2016)  evaluated the “genetic spectrum” of idiopathic RCM. The authors screened for \n108 cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia- associated genes  in 24 patients with idiopathic RCM. They found \npathogenic and “likely -pathogenic” variants in 13 of the 24 patients (54%), and half of these genotype -\npositive patients carried a combination of pathogenic variants, likely -pathogenic variants, and variants \nof unknown significance. Th e most frequent combination included mutations in sarcomeric and \ncytoskeletal genes.  \nKayvanpour et al. (2017)  evaluated the genetic -phenotype associations for DCM. 48 studies \nencompassing 8097 patients were included, and the authors investigated mutations  in LMNA, PLN, \nRBM20, MYBPC3 , MYH7, TNNT2  and TNNI3 . The authors results were as follows: “ The average frequency \nof mutations in the investigated genes was between 1 and 5 %. The mean age of DCM onset was the beginning of the fifth decade for all genes. Heart transplantation (HTx) rate was highest in LMNA mutation carriers (27 %), while RBM20  mutation carriers were transplanted at a markedly younger age \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 9 of 35 \n(mean 28.5 years). While 73 % of DCM patients with LMNA  mutations showed cardiac conduction \ndiseases, low  voltage was the reported ECG hallmark in PLN mutation carriers. The frequency of \nventricular arrhythmia in DCM patients with LMNA  (50 %) and PLN (43 %) mutations was significantly \nhigher. The penetrance of DCM phenotype in subjects with TTN  truncating var iants increased with age \nand reached 100 % by age of 70 .” \nGenetic testing has been recognized  as a valuable part of diagnosis and classification in pediatric \ncardiomyopathy. Lipshultz et al. (2019)  identified a single -center study of 63 children with \ncardiomyopathy that reported  that 42% of the illness could be attributed to a genetic cause, as defined \nby the presence of an affected first -degree family member having tested positive for an HCM or DCM \ngene panel mutation. However, it was noted that though the morphofunctional phenotype in children \nmay be similar to th ose of adults, the causes and proportion resulting from them differ. These \ndifferences are believed to be neuromuscular, metabolic, mitochondrial, and syndromic causes also \nplaying  important role s in children. Lipshultz et al. (2019)  identified another study to  corroborate this  \nfinding: in 916 children with an identified case of cardiomyopathy,  an underlying metabolic or syndromic \ncause was present in more than a third,  and a metabolic or syndromic cause was present in 40% to 50% \nof 61 children with HCM and 8% of 1731 children with DCM in the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry.  \nParker and Landstrom (2021)  reviewed current literature on what role genetic testing plays in diagnosing \nand managing patients and families with a  history of pediatric CM. With relation to HCM, the researchers \nidentified multiple studies demonstrating that patients with “sarcomere variants tend to be more severely affected than patients with non -sarcomeric variants” and “within the sarcomere genes, some \nargue that specific sarcomere variants are inherently more pathogenic than others.” On top of that, there appear to be some other genetic and environmental factors that influence the HCM phenotype in each patient, thus indicating that the genotype- phenotype correlation could greatly affect the clinical \ncourse and prognosis. Especially for metabolic forms of HCM and patients with a clear genetic etiology, treatment may be adopted based on these genetic findings; for instance, “in GAA - positive Pompe \ndisease, alpha- glucosidase enzyme replacement therapy is associated with HCM reversal in affected \nchildren .” \nSimilar concepts were mentioned for DCM, as some genotypes yielded worse phenotypes. For example, “TNNC1  variants are associated with early onset DCM,  and increased rates of heart transplant and SCD \ncompared to other genes.” Gene therapy could also be explored as an option, such as for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, to “target and rescue functional expression of pathogenic variants.” For arrhythmic cardio myopathy (ACM), Parker and Landstrom (2021)  specifically mention how confirming an ACM \ndiagnosis via genetic testing “versus an arrhythmic syndrome secondary to a cardiac channelopathy” could aid clinical management. Variants in the PKP2  and TMEM43  genes have been found to be \nassociated with exercise- induced disease progression and risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), so this \ncould impact chosen involvement in sports.  \nCardiac Ion Channelopathies  \nThe electromechanical pumping action of the heart maintains circulation and ensures the delivery of blood and nutrients to all organs to support their normal function. Synchronized contraction of the myocardium is necessary to generate sufficient pressure to drive blood flow. Mechanical contraction of cardiac myocytes is coordinated by the generation and propagation of an action potential through the synergistic activation and inactivation of several voltage -dependent ion channels. Membrane \ndepolarization during the action potential leads to the opening of the voltage -gated calcium \nchannels  resulting in an inward current, followed by the efflux of potassium ions, generation of an \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 10 of 35 \noutward current, and cell repolarization.  Action potential duration is determined by the magnitude and \ntiming of inward and outward currents. Differential expression, selectivity , and gating properties of \ncardiac ion channels in distinct regions of the heart promote unidirectional propagation of electrical \nactivity.  \nMutations in genes encoding these specific channels or associated proteins may impair ionic conduction resulting in changes in action potential, synchronization, and/or propagation of electrical impulse and predispose to potentially malignant arrhythmias . Dyssynchronous c ontraction of the ventricle, arising \nfrom electrical activation delays, also significantly worsens morbidity and mortality in heart failure (HF) patients. Ion channelopathies have been identified as a significant cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in pati ents with structurally normal hearts, and some cases of otherwise unexplained stillbirth.  \nPatients can show early symptoms of palpitations or hemodynamic compromise, including dizziness, seizure, or syncope, particularly following exertion ; however , in many cases SCD is the only sign of \ncardiac trouble. Electrical disturbances in the heart rhythm that can be detected on electrocardiogram (ECG) of some patients with channelopathies result in diagnosis of:  \n• Long QT Syndrome (LQTS)  is characterized by prolonged ventricular repolarization  and \nelectrocardiographic prolongation of the QT interval (QTc ≥ 480  ms in repeated 12 -lead ECG, \nalthough a QTc ≥ 460  ms is sufficient in the presence of unexplained syncope). The variable clinical \nmanifestations of LQTS range from asymptomatic patients diagnosed through family screening, to \nSCD, syncope, convulsions, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, VF, and  torsade de pointes . The \nprevalence of LQTS in infants is approximately 1/2000.  \n• Brugada Syndrome (BrS) is clinically characterized by right ventricular conduction delay and ST -\nsegment elevation in the anterior right precordial leads. Syncope is one of the main clinical manifestations; individuals with BrS develop a monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that may precipitate during sleep, rest , or fever. Recent reports suggest that BrS could be responsible for 4%–\n12% of all sudden death ( SD) and up to 20% of SD in patients with structurally normal hearts.  \n• Short QT Syndrome (SQTS) is characterized by abnormally short  QT intervals and an increased \npropensity to develop atrial and ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the absence of structural heart disease. Cardiac arrest seems to be the most frequent symptom (up to 40%). Palpitations are a common symptom (30%), followed by s yncope (25%) and atrial fibrillation (AF), which are the first \nsymptoms of the disease in up to 20% of patients. The episodes may occur in a wide range of situations , such as in reaction to loud noise, at rest, during exercise, and during daily activity . \n \n• Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) is characterized by a normal ECG and ventricular arrhythmia in genetically predisposed individuals during intense physical exercise or acute emotional stress. Typical clinical manifestations of C PVT include dizziness and syncope. \nVentricular arrhythmia, however,  may degenerate into rapid polymorphic ventricular tachycardia \nand ventricular fibrillation, leading to SCD.  \n \n \n• Progressive Cardiac Conduction Disease (CCD) is characterized by problems with  the cardiac impulse  \nof the heart.

For example, \nGeneDX offers several customizable panels for various channelopathies and cardiomyopathies. Conditions such as ARVC, Brugada Syndrome, and CPVT are available as separate panels, and GeneDX offers combined panels such as a “Custom Arrhythmia Panel ”, a “ Custom Cardiomyopathy Panel”, and \na “Combined Cardiac Panel.”  Other commercially available panels include offerings from Invitae \n(Invitae) , Fulgent, and BluePrint Genetics . \nAnalytical Validity  (Channelopathies)  \nWare et al. (2013)  compared two NGS approaches for diag nostic sequencing inherited  arrhythmia  \nsyndromes. PCR -based target enrichment and long- read sequencing (PCR -LR) was compared to  in-\nsolution hybridization -based enrichment and short -read sequencing (Hyb -SR). The PCR -LR assay \ncomprehensively assessed five long -QT genes  (KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1 and KCNE2 ) and \"hot \nspots\" in RYR2 . The  Hyb-SR assay targeted 49 genes, including those  in the PCR -LR assay. \nThe sensitivity  for detection of control variants was identical. In both assays, the major limitation was \nupstream target capture, particularly  in regions of extreme GC content. These initial experiences with \nNGS cardiovascular diagno stics achieved up to 89%  sensitivity  at a fraction of current costs . \nProost et al. (2017)  validated a targeted gene panel for next- generation sequencing of 51 genes \nassociated with primary electrical disease with 20 Human Polymorphism Study Center samples and 19 positive control samples with a total of 1479 variants. “An analytical sensitivity and specificity  of 100% \nand 99.9% were obtained .” After validation, the assay was applied to “114 PED patients which identified \n107 variants in 36 different genes, 18 of which were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, 54 variants were of unknown significance, and 35 were classified as likely benign .” They concluded “that \nthe PED Multiplex Amplification of Specific Targets for Resequencing Plus assay is a proficient and highly reliable  test to routinely screen patients experiencing primary  arrhythmias .” \nClinical Utility  and Validity (Channelopathies)  \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 15 of 35 \nGarcia et al. (2016)  proposed a framework for establishing clinical validity for assessing polymorphisms \nof inherited cardiac conditions, as well as evaluating the strength of association bet ween genotype and \nphenotype , from a logical argument. Clinical validity of a gene is established when a gene is known to \ncause disease ; since a specific  variant must be responsible for causing t he disease, a  gene  variant must \nbe known to cause that disease . Conversely, if no variants can be established to cause disease, the \nclinical validity association has not been established.  Variants of unknown significance (VUS) would, \ntherefore, not have established clinical validity. Garcia et al. (2016)  proposed three categories of \nstrength of association : strong, suggested, and emerging.  \n• “Strong” refers to “ cases where there exists at least one clinically observed variant supported by \nsufficient evide nce to classify that variant as pathogenic. “Strong” indicates that the relationship \nhas been proven .” \n• “Suggested” is used in cases where some preliminary evidence exists suggesting a causal \nrelationship, but the relationship has not yet been formally prov en.” \n• “Emerging” is used to describe a growing suspicion that a specific condition is caused by a gene that has already been proven to cause disease.  \nThe authors go on to state that if  one “strong” relationship exists, then clinical validity has been \nestablished.  If not, the gene should be considered of “uncertain significance .” \nThe authors also provide recommendations for gene panels to test for certain  conditions. They “propose \nthat a  comprehensive panel test designed for the molecular diagnosis of a particular condition should \ninclude the following classes of genes:  \n• Genes that have been conclusively proven to cause the condition in question.  \n• Genes suspected but not yet proven to cause  the condition in question.  \n• Genes that have been conclusively proven to cause a condition within the clinical differential. This category should include genes that cause a condition that can progress into the condition in question, genes that cause a condition that can be confused with the condition in question, and genes that cause a syndrome that include the condition in question as a primary feature.  \nThey suggest that the clinical validity of a panel is established when that panel includes a set of genes  \nthat account for a substantial proportion of the genetic causes of the disease in question. Conversely, a panel is NOT valid if it omits certain genes that account for a substantial proportion of the known genetic risk. A clinically valid panel may also include genes for which some preliminary evidence of clinical validity exists (“preliminary evidence genes”) . \nHofman et al. (2013)  analyzed the yield of DNA testing over 15 years. They analyzed results from 7021 \nindividuals who were counseled, 6944 from 2298 different families (aged 41±19 years; 49% male). In \n702 families (31%), a possible disease -causing mutation was detected. The yield of DNA testing of \nprobands with primary electric diseases was 47% in LQTS, 26% in BrS, and 37% in CPVT. Cascade \nscreening revealed 1539 mutation -positive subjects, and in 372 families counseled after sudden \nunexplained death an inherited arrhythmia syndrome was diagnosed in 29% (n=108).  \nLe Scouarnec et al. (2015)  et al . examined 167 index cases presenting with a  Brugada pattern on the \nelectrocardiogram as well as 167 individuals aged over 65 -year s old and showing no history of cardiac \narrhythmia. They found that “a significant enrichment in rare coding variation  (with a minor allele \nfrequency below 0.1%) was observed only for SCN5A , with  rare coding variants carried by 20.4% of cases \nwith BrS versus 2.4% of control individuals . No significant enrichment was observed for any \nother  arrhythmia- suscept ibility  gene, including SCN10A  and CACNA1C . These results indicate that, \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 16 of 35 \nexcept for SCN5A , rare coding variation  in previously reported arrhythmia- susceptibility  genes  do not \ncontribute significantly to the occurrence of BrS in a population with European ancestry. Extreme \ncaution should thus be taken when interpreting genetic  variation  in molecular diagnostic setting, \nsince  rare coding variants were observed in a similar extent among cases versus controls, for most \npreviously reported BrS -suscepti bility  genes .” \nTester et al. (2012) examined 173 cases of sudden unexpl ained death that were referred for cardiac \nchannel molecular autopsy.  The mutational analysis included the long QT syndrome genes ( KCNQ1 , \nKCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1 , and KCNE2 ) and a catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)  \ntype 1 –associated g ene (RYR2 ). Overall, 45 putative pathogenic mutations absent in 400 to 700 controls \nwere identified in 45 autopsy -negative SUD cases (26.0%).   \nSeidelmann et al. (2017)  evaluated the use of whole exome sequencing for clinical diagnosis, risk \nstratification, and management of inherited  CVD. They found that g enetic  diagnosis was reached with a \nsuccess rate of 26.5% (53 /200 patients). This compares to 18% (36 /200) that would have been diagnosed \nusing commercially available  genetic panels ; although , this finding was not statistically significant . The \nauthors concluded , “Whole exome sequencing was particularly useful for clinical diagnosis in patients \nwith aborted sudden  cardiac  death, in whom the primary insult for the presence of both \ndepressed  cardiac  function and prolonged QT had remained unkno wn. The analysis of the remaining \ncases using genome annotation and disease segregation led to the discovery of novel candidate genes in another 14% of the cases .” \nMunroe et al. (2018)  examined tissue  from 242 stillbirths (≥22 weeks), including those where no definite \ncause of death could be confirmed after a full autopsy. Seventy  cases  were examined , which were then \nsequenced for a custom panel of 35 genes.  One putative pathogenic  variant was found , and several \nnovel variants of uncertain significance resulting in cardiac channelopathies was identified in some cases of otherwise unexplained stillbirth. The authors concluded “these variants may have a role in fetal demise .” \nWang et al. (2017)  examined the “genetic spectrum” of LVNC. The authors sequenced 73 \ncardiomyopathy -related genes in 102 patients, and 43 pathogenic variants were identified in 16 genes \nin 39 patients. Sarcomeric variants accounted for 63% of these variants whereas variants associated with channelopathies accounted for 12%. MYH7  and TAZ path ogenic variants were the most common , and \npatients with pathogenic variants showed more severe symptoms such as earlier age of onset . \nvan Lint et al. (2019)  evaluated the detection rates for variants of unknown  (class 3) , likely  (class 4) , and \ncertain  (class 5)  pathogenicity in cardiogenetic gene panels. 936 patients were evaluated with the \narrhythmia panel s (four  versions ), and 1970 patients were evaluated with the cardiomyopath y panels \n(six versions ). The arrhythmia  panel s detected class 3 variants in 34.8% of patients, class 4 variants in \n4.2% of patients, and class 5 variants in 4.6% of patients. The cardiomyopathy panels  detected class 3 \nvariants in 40.8% of patients, class 4  variants in 7.9% of patients, and class 5 variants in 12% of patients. \nOverall, the arrhythmia  panels detected variants of interest in 44% of patients, and the cardiomyopathy  \npanels detected variants of interest in 61% of patients. The authors concluded t hat “l arger gene panels \ncan increase the detection rate of likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants, but mainly increase the frequency of variants of unknown pathogenicity .” \nV. Guidelines and Recommendations  \nAmerican Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and the Heart Rhythm Society   \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 17 of 35 \nIn 2017 the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Heart \nRhythm Society (HRS) published the Guideline for Management of Patients With Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death that recom mends  the following : \nGenetic Considerations in Arrhythmia Syndromes  \n• In patients and family members in whom genetic testing for risk stratification for SCA or SCD is recommended, genetic counseling is beneficial. (I)  \n• The diagnosis of most inherited arrhythmia syndromes is based on clinical features and family history. The availability of genetic testing for inherited arrhythmia syndromes can: 1) provide opportunity to confirm a suspected clinical diagnosis and sometimes provide prognostic information for the  proband and 2) offer cascade screening of potentially affected family members \nwhen a disease -causing mutation is identified in the proband. The yield of genetic testing varies by \ndisease.  \n• Genotyping is frequently most useful when a pathogenic mutation is identified in the proband, such that screening can be applied to relatives who are in a preclinical phase, allowing institution of \nlifestyle changes, therapy, or ongoing monitoring for those who are gene mutation positive . \n• In young patients (<40 years of a ge) without structural heart disease who have unexplained cardiac \narrest, unexplained near drowning, or recurrent exertional syncope, genetic testing may be \nimportant to identify an inherited arrhythmia syndrome as a likely cause . \nArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy  \n• “Selected first -degree relatives refers to relatives who are willing to undergo further testing and \nwho could benefit from further screening and testing (and not the terminally ill patients or those who do not want to be screened and  tested).”  \n• “Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is detected clinically in approximately 35% to \n40% of first -degree relatives, most commonly in siblings or symptomatic first -degree relatives”  \n• “The proband with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is usually diagnosed by the \npresence of clinical symptoms along with the presence of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy Task Force criteria”  \n• “A pathogenic genetic mutation  was added to the major Task Force criteria in 2010. The yield of \ngenetic testing in probands with suspected arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is generally 30% to 54%, and is up to 58% among patients with a strong family history of SCD in multiple members. A negative genetic test for arrhythmogenic  right ventricular cardiomyopathy \ndoes not exclude the disease, and a positive genetic test currently does not guide therapy.”  \nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy  \n• “In ﬁrst -degree relatives of patients with HCM due to a known causative mutation, genetic \ncounseling and mutation -speciﬁc genetic testing are recommended .” \n• “In patients with clinically suspected or diagnosed HCM, genetic counseling and genetic testing are reasonable.”  \n• “When genetic testing reveals a mutation in the index patient, ascertainment of genetic status in first- and second -degree relatives can be predictive of risk for developing HCM. Relatives with overt \nHCM will have the same pathogenic HCM mutation as the index patient.”  \nCardiac Channelopathies  \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 18 of 35 \n• In first -degree relatives  of patients who have a causative mutation for long QT syndrome, \ncatecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, short QT syndrome, or Brugada syndrome, \ngenetic counseling and mutation -specific genetic testing are recommended (I)  \n• Clinical screening of first -degree relatives of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes is crucial \nto identifying affected family members. Due to the increased risk of adverse cardiac events in genotype positive patients with long QT syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorp hic ventricular \ntachycardia, and Brugada syndrome, targeted screening for the identified family -specific mutation \ncan identify individuals who are at risk for these adverse outcomes  \nCongenital Long QT Syndrome  \n• In patients with clinically diagnosed long QT syndrome, genetic counseling and genetic testing are recommended (I)  \n• Genetic testing for disease- causing mutations in long QT syndrome offers important diagnostic, \nprognostic, and therapeutic information in addition to the clinical evaluation, and a positive test can facilitate establishing risk for family members. The yield of genetic testing in long QT syndrome phenotype -positive patients is 50% to 86%, with the higher range present in patients with marked \nQT prolongation or positive family history of SCD . A negative genetic test does not exclude the \ndiagnosis of long QT syndrome, which relies on the clinical evaluation.  \nCatecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) \n• In patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and w ith clinical VT or \nexertional syncope, genetic counseling and genetic testing are reasonable (IIa)  \n• Genetic testing may be useful to confirm the diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which is suggested by the development of bidirectional VT with exertion or stress. Recognition of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia as the cause for exertional symptoms should prompt aggressive therapy to prevent the significant risk of SCD. Therapy for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is not guided by genotype status, but screening of first -degree relatives may be facilitated with genetic testing.  \nBrugada Syndrome  \n• In patients with suspected or established Brugada syndrome, genetic counseling and genetic testi ng \nmay be useful to facilitate cascade screening of relatives (IIb)  \n• The yield of genetic testing in phenotype positive patients is approximately 20% to 30% in Brugada syndrome. SCN5A  variants account for most of this subset of genotype positive Brugada syndrome. \nHowever, 2% to 10% of otherwise healthy individuals host a rare variant of SCN5A . A negative \ngenetic test does not exclude the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome, which is usually based on electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics. Risk stratification is based on symptoms and clinical findings; genotype status is  not correlated with the risk of adverse events. Identification of a \npathogenetic mutation may help facilitate recognition of carrier status in family members, allowing for lifestyle modification and potential treatment.  \nShort QT syndrome  \n• In patients with short QT syndrome, genetic testing may be considered to facilitate screening of first-degree relatives (IIb)  \n• Pathogenic mutations in potassium channels have been identified in approximately 10% to 20% of \npatients with short QT syndrome, including in KCNH2  (SQT1), KCNQ1  (SQT2), and KCNJ2  (SQT3).  \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 19 of 35 \nEarly Repolarization “J -wave” Syndrome  \n• In patients with early repolarization pattern on ECG, genetic testing is not recommended (III -no \nbenefit)  \nPostmortem Evaluation of SCD  \n• In first -degree relatives of SCD victims who were 40 years of age or younger, cardiac evaluation is \nrecommended, with genetic counseling and genetic testing performed as indicated by clinical \nfindings (I)  \n• For family risk profiling, it is important to use the disease -specific genetic test panel that \ncorresponds to the autopsy findings. Risk profiling of family members of an SCD victim suspected of having an inherited cardiomyopathy at autopsy is important. Although phenotyping of surviving family members is crucial, genotyping of the SCD proband provides a mechanism for efficient follow -\nup evaluation of those relatives with the disease-causing mutation found in the proband.  \nAmerican Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America (AHA/ACC/HFSA ) Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure \nThese 2022 guidelines provide guidelines on genetic evaluation  and testing for the management of \nheart failure. The relevant recommendations are captured below:  \n• “In first -degree relatives of selected patients with genetic or inherited cardiomyopathies, genetic \nscreening and counseling are recommended to detect cardiac disease and prompt consideration of treatments to decrease HF progression and sudden death.”  \n• “In select patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, referral for genetic counseling and testing is reasonable to identify conditions that could guide treatment for patients and family members.”  \nThese joint recommendations also urge that “ In patients in whom a genetic or inherited cardiomyopathy \nis suspected, a family history should be performed, including at least 3 generations and ideally diagrammed as a family tree pedigree .” \nHeart Failure Society of American and American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)   \nIn 2018, the Heart Failure Society of America and the American College of Medical Genetics and \nGenomics  published a clinical practice resource for the genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy. There,  \n“Recommendation 1. Genetic testing is recommended for patients with cardiomyopathy  \n(a) Genetic testing is recommended for the most clearly affected family member.  \n(b) Cascade genetic testing of at -risk family members is recommended for pathogenic and likely \npathogenic variants.  \n(c) In addition to routine newborn screening tests, specialized evaluation of infants with cardiomyopathy is recommended, and genetic testing should be considered.”  \nOn the point of whom to test, the societies  have the following to say:  \n“To yield the most conclusive, informative results, diagnostic genetic tes ting is optimally initiated on a \nconfirmed affected individual. Furthermore, as there are sometimes multiple genetic variants contributing to disease in a single family, the testing should ideally be initiated on the person who is \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 20 of 35 \nmost likely to harbor the  disease -causing variant or variants. This is frequently the individual in the family \nwith the most severe disease and/or the earliest disease onset. This is a well  established principle in \nclinical genetics, as selecting the individual with the most evident disease increases the likelihood of \nfinding a genetic cause. If the ideal person for initiation of genetic testing in a family is unavailable or \nunwilling to proceed, then comprehensive genetic testing should be considered for another \nunequivocally affected family member.”  \nAs for when to test, ACMG “recommend[s] genetic testing at the time a new cardiomyopathy diagnosis is made, but it can be conducted at any time following diagnosis. Education and counseling regarding genetic testing options are a key component of the process. For those who have had genetic testing in the past, retesting may be appropriate if the previous testing produced negative or inconclusive results and the test’s detection rate has improved. This latter point is particularly relevant for DCM as the gene \npanels have rapidly expanded (e.g., TTN and others) and are anticipated to continue”  (Hershberger et \nal., 2018) . A chart of selected genes implicated in various cardiomyopathies is included below.  \n \n(Table 1 above appropriated  from (Hershberger et al., 2018) ) \nThe specific cardiomyopathy comments are as follows:  \nHCM  \n• “Beyond sarcomeric genes, core genes to screen in patients with HCM include GLA, PRKAG2 , and \nLAMP2 .” \n• “Consultation with a geneticist is indicated.” \n \nDCM  \n• “Core genes to be tested in individuals with DCM include genes encoding sarcomeric and \ncytoskeletal proteins.”  \n• “Genetic testing is important in mothers of individuals with Duchenne or Becker to determine \ncarrier status because carrier females may develop DCM in the third to fifth decade of life.”  \nLVNC  \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 21 of 35 \n• “Genetic testing is not recommended when  the LVNC phenotype is identified serendipitously in \nasymptomatic individuals with otherwise normal cardiovascular structure and function.”  \nAs such, these genes may form an important backdrop upon which the following is performed: \n“Recommendation 2. Focused cardiovascular phenotyping is recommended when pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants in cardiomyopathy genes, designated for reporting of secondary findings by the ACMG, are identified in an individual.  \n(a) If a cardiovascular phenotype is identified as would be predicted by currently available knowledge \nof the gene/ variant pair, all usual approaches described in this document for a genetic evaluation, including family -based approaches, are recommended.  \n(b) If no cardiovascular disease phenotype is identified in the individual, recommendations for surveillance screening at intervals should be considered.  \n(c) If no cardiovascular phenotype is identified in the individual, cascade evaluation of at -risk relatives \nmay be considered, tempered by the strength of evid ence supporting the pathogenicity of the \nvariant, the usual age of onset of the gene/variant pair, and pedigree information (e.g., the ages of at-risk family members, other previously known cardiovascular clinical data in the pedigree, and \nrelated informat ion).” \nAmerican College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)   \nMoreover, in  2021 , ACMG referenced  several myopathies and channelopathies in  their “minimum” list \nof genes for which mutations should be reported when whole genome sequencing is performed for other primary purposes (incidental findings). Those genes are listed below:  \n• FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, ACTA2, MYH11  for aortopathies  \n• PKP2,  DSP, DSC2, TMEM43, and DSG2  for ARVC  \n• RYR2 , CASQ2, and TRDN  for Catecholaminergic  polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) \n• TNNT2, LMNA, FLNC, and TTN for DCM  \n• COL3A1 for Ehlers -Danlos syndrome, vascular type  \n• LDLR, APOB, and PCSK9  for Familial hypercholesterolemia  \n• MYH7, MYBP3, TNNI3, TPM1, MYL3, ACTC1, PRKAG2, and MYL2  for HCM  \n• KCNQ1  and KCNH2  for Long QT syndrome types 1 and 2  \n• SCN5A  for Long QT syndrome 3; Brugada syndrome   \nIn an erratum published in 2021, the authors appended a series of  new gene- phenotype pairings , each \nassociated with the cardiovascular phenotype “ Risk of sudden death with preventive interventions \navailable ”: CASQ2 /catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) , \nTRDN /catecholaminergic polymorphic v entricular tachycardia (CPVT) & long QT syndrome , \nFLNC /cardiomyopathy , and TTN/cardiomyopathy.  \nThe Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) /The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) Expert Consensus \nStatement   \nHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy  (HCM)  \nClass I recommendations  (is recommended) :  \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 22 of 35 \n• “Comprehensive or targeted (MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1) HCM genetic testing is \nrecommended for any patient in whom a cardiologist has established a clinical diagnosis of HCM based on examination of the patient's clinical history, family history, and \nelectrocardiographic/echocardiographic phenotype.”  \n• “Mutation -specific genetic testing is recommended for family members and appropriate relatives \nfollowing the identification of the HCM -causative mutation in an index case .” \nDilated Cardiomyopathy  (DCM) \nClass I recommendations:  \n• “Comprehensive or targeted ( LMNA and SCN5A ) DCM genetic testing is recommended for patients \nwith DCM and significant cardiac conduction disease (i.e., first -, second -, or third - degree heart \nblock) and/or with a family history of premature unexpected sudden death. ” \n• “Mutation -specific testing is recommended for family members and appropriate relatives following \nthe identification of a DCM -causative mutation in the index case. ” \nClass IIa recomme ndations:  \n• Genetic testing can be useful for patients with familial DCM to confirm the diagnosis, to recognize \nthose who are highest risk of arrhythmia and syndromic features, to facilitate cascade screening within the family, and to help with family planning.  \nArrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy  (ARVC)  \nClass I recommendations:  \n• “Mutation -specific genetic testing is recommended for family members and appropriate relatives \nfollowing the identification of the ACM/ARVC - causative mutation in an index  case.”  \nClass II recommendations:  \n• “Comprehensive or targeted ( DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP, PKP2, and TMEM43) ACM/ARVC genetic testing \ncan be useful for patients satisfying task force diagnostic criteria for ACM/ARVC.”  (II-A, can be \nuseful ) \n• “Genetic testing may be  considered for patients with possible ACM/ARVC (1 major or 2 minor \ncriteria) according to the 2010 task force criteria (European Heart Journal) .” (II-B , may be \nconsidered ) \nLeft Ventricular Noncompaction (LVNC)  \nClass I recommendations : \n• “Mutation -specific genetic testing is recommended for family members and appropriate relatives \nfollowing the identification of a LVNC -causative mutation in the index case.” \nClass II recommendations : \n• LVNC genetic testing can be useful for patients in whom a  cardiologist has established a clinical \ndiagnosis of LVNC based on examination of the patient's clinical history, family history, and electrocardiographic/echocardiographic phenotype.

This guideline replaced the 2011 guideline released \njointly by the ACCF and the AHA. The updated 2020 guideline has also been endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). With relation to genetic testing, they released the following with a  level B -NR \nquality of evidence, signifying “moderate -quality evidence from 1 or more well- designed, well -executed \nnonrandomized studies, observational studies, or registry studies; meta -analyses of such studies”:  \nClass 1 (Benefit >>> Risk)  \n• “In patients wi th HCM, evaluation of familial inheritance, including a 3 -generation family history, is \nrecommended as part of the initial assessment  \n• In patients with HCM, genetic testing is beneficial to elucidate the genetic basis to facilitate the identification of family members at risk for developing HCM (cascade testing)  \n• In patients with an atypical clinical presentation of HCM or when another genetic condition is suspected to be the cause, a work- up including genetic testing for HCM and other genetic causes of \nunexplained cardiac hypertrophy (“HCM phenocopies”) is recommended  \n• In patients with HCM who choose to undergo genetic testing, pre- and posttest genetic counseling \nby an expert in the genetics of cardiovascular disease is recommended so that risks, benefits,  \nresults, and their clinical significance can be reviewed and discussed with the patient in a shared decision -making process  \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 26 of 35 \n• When performing genetic testing in an HCM proband, the initial tier of genes tested should include \ngenes with strong evidence to b e disease -causing in HCM*  \n• In first -degree relatives of patients with HCM, both clinical screening (ECG and 2D echocardiogram) \nand cascade genetic testing (when a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant has been identified in the proband) should be offered  \n• In families where a sudden unexplained death has occurred with a postmortem diagnosis of HCM, \npostmortem genetic testing is beneficial to facilitate cascade genetic testing and clinical screening in first -degree relatives  \n• In patients with HCM who have under gone genetic testing, serial reevaluation of the variant(s) \nidentified is recommended to assess for variant reclassification, which may impact diagnosis and cascade genetic testing in family members  \n• In affected families with HCM, preconception and prenatal  reproductive and genetic counseling \nshould be offered” \n• NOTE: “Strong evidence HCM genes include, at the time of this publication, MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, MYL2, MYL3, and ACTC1 ” \nClass 2b (Benefit ≥ Risk)  \n• “In patients with HCM, the usefulness of genetic testing in the assessment of risk of SCD [sudden cardiac death] is uncertain  \n• In patients with HCM who harbor a variant of uncertain significance, the usefulness of clinical genetic testing of phenotype- negative relatives for the purpo se of variant reclassification is \nuncertain”  \nNo benefit  \n• “For patients with HCM who have undergone genetic testing and were found to have no pathogenic variants (ie, harbor only benign/likely benign variants), cascade genetic testing of the family is not useful  \n• Ongoing clinical screening is not indicated in genotype -negative relatives in families with genotype -\npositive HCM, unless the disease- causing variant is downgraded to variant of uncertain significance, \nlikely benign, or benign variant during follow -up.”  \nThe ACCF and AHA also published a joint guideline, regarding the “Management of Heart Failure”, which states that “Increasingly, it is recognized that many (20% to 35%) patients with an idiopathic DCM have \na familial cardiomyopathy (defined as 2 close ly related family members who meet the criteria for \nidiopathic DCM).” “Advances in technology permitting high -throughput sequencing and genotyping at \nreduced costs have brought genetic screening to the clinical arena” and refers to the 2009 and 2011 publis hed guidelines. The guidelines further note that genetic testing may be considered in conjunction \nwith counseling in familial DCM . \nEuropean Society of Cardiology (ECS)   \nGenetic counselling is recommended for all HCM patients when the HCM is not explained solely by a non-genetic cause.  \nGenetic testing is recommended for patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for HCM, both as a confirmatory test and to enable genetic testing for relatives. Both cascade genetic screening and a clinical evaluation are recommended for first -degree relatives that carry the same mutation as the HCM \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 27 of 35 \npatient (“proband”). Even if a mutation is absent, relatives should consider reassessment sho uld \nsymptoms appear or other clinical data emerges. A genetic analysis, such as pedigree analysis and high -\nthroughput sequencing, should include the most implicated  sarcomere protein genes. If a rarer \ncondition is suspected, the analysis should include the  gene responsible for that condition.  \nPre-natal genetic testing is not recommended due to phenotypic variability.  \nHeart Rhythm Society (HRS ) \nArrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathies   \nThe HRS published an “Expert Consensus Statement” on “ Evaluation, Risk Stratificat ion, and \nManagement of Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy .” In it, they include recommendations on genetic \ntesting for this set of cardiac disorders.  \n“For individuals and decedents with either a clinical or necropsy  diagnosis of ACM, genetic testing of the \nestablished ACM -susceptibility genes is recommended. ” \n“For genetic testing of the established ACM -susceptibility genes,  comprehensive analysis of all \nestablished genes with full coverage  is recommended.” \n“When a likely pathogenic or pathogenic genetic variant has been identified in the proband, cascade \ngenetic testing can be offered to first- degree at -risk relatives … Cascade genetic testing is therefore only \noffered to family members where a likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant in a known disease -\nassociated gene is identified in the proband .” \nAmerican Heart Association (AHA)  \nThe AHA published a guideline regarding cardiomyopathy in children. In it, they state that “ genetic \ntesting should first be performed in the individual known to have a specific cardiomyopathy phenotype \nand should be informed by the child’s overall presentation, with a detailed examination looking for dysmorphic features, muscle weakness, scoliosis, or specific laboratory findings.”  They also state that \nindications for genetic testi ng include “ determining the cause of HCM, predicting the clinical course and \nseverity, screening first -degree relatives, and determining recurrence risk .”  \nThis guideline addresses HCM, DCM, RCM, LVNC, Arrhythmogenic Ventricular Cardiomyopathy  (both \nright and left ventricles) , as well as cardiomyopathy caused by channelopathies such as Long- QT \nsyndrome . However, though it addresses the many manifestations of cardiomyopathy, few suggestions \nfor clinical practice are made due to “the lack of evidence and consensus in the classification and diagnosis of children with cardiomyopathy”, such that the document takes the form of a scientific statement instead of clinical guidelines.  \nThe AHA also published a guideline discussing early repolarization. In it, they remark that the biological basis for early repolarization pattern “remains incompletely understood .” Therefore, the AHA proposes \n“large -scale, unbiased (eg, genome -wide association studies), family -guided genetic discovery \napproaches, as well as efforts aimed at understanding both the mechanisms underlying ER and the associated arrhythmogenesis .” \nIn a 2020 statement from the AHA titled “ Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiovascular Diseases: A \nScientific Statement From the Am erican Heart Association ”, the AHA pointed towards  a 2018 conjoint \n^\n\n \n \nAvalon Healthcare Solutions is an independent company providing laboratory benefits management on behalf of HMSA .  \n \nM2025 Genetic Testing for Inherited Cardiomyopathies and Channelopathies   Page 28 of 35 \nguideline by the HFSA with the ACMG for guidance  for genetic testing of cardiomyopathies . The \npertinent recommendations were extracted and are presented below:  \n“A family history of at least  3 generations should be obtained for all patients with a primary \ncardiomyopathy. Second, clinical screening for cardiomyopathy is recommended for at -risk first -degree \nrelatives. Third, patients with genetic, familial, or other unexplained forms of cardiom yopathy should be \nreferred to expert centers. Genetic counseling is recommended for all patients with cardiomyopathy \nand their family members.  \nIn a family, testing should be directed to the most clearly affected family member. If that individual is \nfound t o have a gene variant that is judged to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic, then cascade genetic \ntesting for that variant should be offered to at -risk family members. For infants with cardiomyopathy, in \naddition to any routine newborn screening tests that might have been performed, the specialized \nevaluation is likely to include genetic testing and should also include an evaluation for syndromic or metabolic conditions for which a specific intervention or therapy might be warranted .” \nFinally, the guideline notes that the management of certain conditions may benefit or otherwise be \ninfluenced by the results of genetic testing. Long -QT syndrome, HCM, DCM, and RCM are listed as having \nvariants that may be specifically targeted with certain treatments.  \nVI.

Hereditar y arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies are primarily \ndiagnosed clinically and symptoms can be variable, even within the same family. Most hereditary cardiac conditions are associated with multiple genes and while genetic test results may not guide medical management for those with a clinical diagnosis, identification of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant can allow for cascade testing of asymptomatic family members who might benefit from life -saving treatment.  \nCongenital heart defects (CHDs) are structural heart defects that are present a t birth. CHDs affect 1  \nto 1.2% of live births and can be caused by genetic and environmental factors. Determining an \nunderlying genetic cause for CHD can aid in assessing recurrence risks for at -risk family members, \nevaluating for associated extracardiac i nvolvement, assessing for neurodevelopmental delays, and \nproviding a more accurate prognosis for the patient.  \nFamilial \nhypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease and is \ncharacteri\nzed by sev erely elevated LDL ch\nolesterol (LDL -C) levels that lead to atherosclerotic \nplaque deposition in the coronary arteries and proximal aorta at an early age, leading to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. An estimated 70%  to 95% of FH results from a \nheterozygous pathogenic variant in one of three genes ( APOB, LDLR, PCSK9 ) and determining the \ngenetic cause of FH can aid in identifying at- risk family members and directing treatment options.  \nThis docum\nent addresses genetic testing for cardiac disorders, focusing on cardiomyopathy, \narrhythmia, congenital heart defects, and cholesterol disorders.   \n \n\n \n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Cardiac Disorders  \nV2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023    \n \n \n \n 2 \n POLICY REFERENCE TABLE \nBelow is a list of higher volume tests and the associated laboratories for each coverage criteria \nsection.

Oftentimes, the best way to find the genetic cause is to start by testing someone in the family who is known or strongly suspected to have the disease. If their testing is positive, then we can say that we have found the familial pathogenic (harmful) variant. We can use this as a marker to test other members of the family to see who is also at risk. \n \nComprehensive Cardiomyopathy Panels  \nHeart Failure Society of America and American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG)  \n\n \n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Cardiac Disorders  \nV2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023    \n \n \n \n 18 \n The Heart \nFailure Society of America published joint guidelines with the American College of \nMedical Genetics and Genomics (Hershberger et al, 2018) and made the following \nrecommendations: \n● Guideline 4: Genetic testing is recommended for patients with cardiomyopathy (Level of \nevidence \nA) \n○ 4a: Genetic testing is recommended for the most clearly affected family member.  \n○ 4b: Cascade genetic testing of at -risk family members is recommended for pathogenic \nand likely pathogenic variants. \n○ 4c: In addition to routine newborn screening tests, specialized evaluation of infants \nwith cardiomyopathy is recommended, and genetic testing should be considered (p. \n289) \nPer the guideline, multigene panel genetic testing is recommended over a serial single -gene testing \napproach owing to the genetically and heterogeneous nature of cardiomyopathy. (p.290) \nAsia P\nacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) \nThe Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) published an \nexpert consensus statement (Stiles et al, 2020) on the investigation of decedents with sudden unexplained death and patients wi th sudden cardiac arrest, and of their families that includes the \nfollowing “take -home messages” related to genetic testing:  \n● For survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), victims of sudden unexplained death (SUD), and their relatives, a multidisciplinary team is central to thorough investigation, so as to maximize the opportunity to make a diagnosis. Where there has been an SCD or resuscitated SCA and a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing and counseling is essential for families, to ensure that risk s, benefits, results, and the clinical significance of \ngenetic testing can be discussed. (p. e3) \n● A comprehensive autopsy is an essential part of the investigation of SUD and should include collection and storage of tissue suitable for genetic analysis. When the autopsy suggests a possible genetic cause, or no cause and the heart is normal, referral to a multidisciplinary team for further investigation is indicated. (p. e3)  \n● For victims of SCD or survivors of cardiac arrest where the phenotype is known, genet ic \ntesting of the proband focused on likely candidate genes, along with clinical evaluation of family members, aids in identifying family members with, or at risk of developing, the same condition. (p. e3) \n● For the investigation of SCA survivors, essential inquiry includes detailed personal and \nfamily history, witness accounts, physical examination, multiple electrocardiograms (ECGs), and cardiac imaging. Ambulatory monitoring and/or provocative testing (exercise, pharmacological, and invasive electrophysiol ogical) may provide additional useful \n\n \n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Cardiac Disorders  \nV2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023    \n \n \n \n 19 \n information\n.

(p. e4) \n● Genetic investigation of SCA survivors is best undertaken at a center with multidisciplinary \ncare infrastructure and should focus on likely candidate genes known to be causally related \nto the suspected phenotype. In some cases, genetic evaluation without a suspected phenotype may be undertaken with appropriate genetic counseling, although genetic evalu ation of patients with a known nongenetic cause of cardiac arrest is discouraged.

Screening first -degree famil y members of patients with \nHCM, using either genetic testing or an imaging/electrocardiographic surveillance protocol, can begin at any age and can be influenced by specifics of the patient/family history and family preference. As screening recommendations for family members hinge on the pathogenicity of any detected variants, the reported pathogenicity should be reconfirmed every 2 to 3 years.” (p. e161) \nAmerican College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association \nThe American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) (2011) issued joint guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. They state that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is clinically recognized by a maximal left ventricular wall thickness of 15mm or greater in adults, and the equivalent relative to body surface area in children. They also recommended that screening (with or without genetic testing) be performed in first- degree\n  relatives of indiv iduals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The following recommendations were made for DCM:  \n“Evidence indicates that clinical genetic testing can identify the cause of DCM in families with autosomal dominant inheritance in approximately 25  to 40% o\n f cases, whereas in \nisolated cases of DCM, the yield of testing is commonly estimated at 10  to 25%. Core \ngene\ns to be tested in individuals with DCM include genes encoding sarcomeric and \ncytoskeletal proteins, although DCM testing panels typically carry several dozen genes, some with uncertain significance. In most cases, all HCM and ARVC genes are included in DCM panels because of gene/phenotype overlap.” ( p. 903) \n“As in HCM, infants and children with DCM may require additional diagnostic evaluation.” (p. 904)  \nThis guideline also acknowledges that DCM can be caused by non- genetic factors including \n“...coronary artery disease, primary valvular or congenital heart disease, or previous exposure to \ncancer chemotherapy or other injurious drugs… ” and therefore these causes must be excluded \nwhen c\nonsi\ndering genetic testing.

(Class I)  \n● Comprehensive or LQT1-3 ( KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A ) targeted LQTS genetic testing is \nrecommended for any asymptomatic patient with QT prolongation in the absence of other clinical conditions that might prolong the QT interval (such as electrolyte abnormalities, hypertrophy, bundle branch block, etc, ie, otherwise idiopathic) on serial 12- lead ECGs \ndefined as QTc.480 ms (prepuberty) or 500 ms (adults). (Class I) \n● Mutation -specific genetic testing is recommended for family members and other \nappropriate relatives subsequently following the identification of the LQTS -causative \nmutation in an index case. (Class I) \n● Comprehensive or LQT1-3 ( KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A ) targeted LQT S genetic testing may \nbe considered for any asymptomatic patient with otherwise idiopathic QTc values 460 ms (prepuberty) or 480 ms (adults) on serial 12- lead ECGs. (Class I)  \nSchwartz, Crotti; 2012 \nSchwartz and Crotti published a scoring system in which to  diagnose LQTS. They suggest  using \nthe Schwartz score for  “selection of those patients who should undergo molecular screening \n(everyone with a score greater than or equal to 3.0) and in the use of “cascade screening” for the identification of all affected family members including the silent mutation carriers (p. 5)”.  \nSCORE: less than or equal to 1 point: low probability of LQTS.  \n1.5 to 3 points: intermediate probability of LQTS.  \n3.5 points or more: high probability. \n \nBrugada Syndrome Panels or SCN5A Variant Analysis  \n\n \n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Cardiac Disorders  \nV2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023    \n \n \n \n 29 \n Heart Rhythm Society and European Heart Rhythm Association \nThe Heart Rhythm Society and the European Heart Rhythm Association (2011) published joint \nrecommendations and made the following recommendations for genetic testing for BrS (p. 1311): \n● Mutation- sp\necific genetic testing is recommended for family members and appropriate \nrelatives following the identification of the BrS -causative mutation in an index case. (Class \nI) \n● Comprehensive or BrS1 ( SCN5A ) targeted BrS genetic testing can be usef ul for any patient \nin whom a cardiologist has established a clinical index of suspicion for BrS based on examination of the patient’s clinical history, family history, and expressed electrocardiographic (resting 12 -lead ECGs and/or provocative drug challenge testing) \nphenotype. (Class IIa) \n● Genetic testing is not indicated in the setting of an isolated type 2 or type 3 Brugada ECG pattern. (Class III)  \nCatecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Panels \n \nHeart Rhythm Society and European Heart Rhythm Association \nThe Heart Rhythm Society and the European Heart Rhythm Association (2011) published joint recommendations and made the following recommendations for genetic testing for CPVT (p. 1311): \n● Comprehens \nive or CPVT1 and CVPT2 ( RYR2 & CASQ2 ) targ eted CPVT genetic testing is \nrecommended for any patient in whom a cardiologist has established a clinical index of suspicion for CPVT based on examination of the patient’s clinical history, family history, and expressed electrocardiographic phenotype duri ng provocative stress testing with cycle, \ntreadmill, or catecholamine infusion. Mutation -specific genetic testing is recommended for \nfamily members and appropriate relatives following the identification of the CPVT -\ncausative mutation in an index case. (Class I)  \nFamilial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) Panels  \nMigliara et al. (2017) \nMigliara et al. (2017) conducted a systematic review of guidelines on genetic testing and management of individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The literature search, conducted through April 2017, identified 10 guidelines for inclusion. Three of the guidelines were developed within the U. S.: those by the National Lipid Association, International FH   \n\n \n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Cardiac Disorders  \nV2.2023  \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023    \n \n \n \n 30 \n Foundation, a\nnd American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of \nEndocrinology. Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence was also \nincluded in the review. The quality of the guidelines was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument, with guideline quality ranging from average to good. Most guidelines agreed that genetic testing follows cholesterol testing, physical findings distinctive of FH, and highly suggestive family history of FH. Universal screening for FH was not recommended. This r eview highlighted the importance of genetic \ntesting for FH in children, because aggressive treatment at an earlier age may prevent premature coronary heart disease. \nMusunuru et al, (2020) \n\"An international expert panel convened by the FH Foundation wrote a scientific statement on clinical genetic testing for FH. This statement generally recommends genetic testing of FH genes ( LDLR, APOB, PCSK9 , and potentially other genes if warranted by the patient \nphenotype; Table 3) for individuals with hypercholesterolemia for which an inherited variant is a likely cause. The statement highlights individuals with some combination of persistent elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, personal history of premature coronary artery disease, fam ily history of hypercholesterolemia, and family history of premature \ncoronary artery disease who should be offered or may be considered for genetic testing (Table 4). In addition, cascade genetic testing should be offered to all at- risk family members of a n \nindividual found to have a pathogenic variant in a FH gene. Genetic testing for FH is expected to result in a higher rate of diagnosis among patients with FH, more effective cascade testing, the initiation of therapies at earlier ages, and more accurate risk stratification\" \n(p. 381). \nNational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute \nRecommendations from a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute expert panel on cardiovascular \nhealth and risk reduction in children and adolescents were published in 2011. The report contained the following recommendations (see Table 1 below from p. S230). \nTable 1. Recommendations on Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents  \nRecommendation  GOE  \n“The evidence review supports the concept that early identification and control of dyslipidemia throughout youth and into adulthood will substantially reduce clinical CVD risk beginning in young adult life. B\n \n\n \n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Cardiac Disorders \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023   \n \n \n \n31 \n Preliminary evidence in children with heterozygous FH with markedly \nelevated LDL-C indicates that earlier treatment is associated with \nreduced subclinical evidence of atherosclerosis.”  \n“TC and LDL-C levels fall as much as 10 to 20% or more during \npuberty.” B \n“Based on this normal pattern of change in lipid and lipoprotein levels \nwith growth and matura\ntion, age 10 years (range age 9 to 11 years) is a \nstable time for lipid assessment in children. For most children, this age \nrange will precede onset of puberty.” D \nCVD: cardiovascular disease; FH: familial hypercholesterolemia;GOE: grade of evidence; LDL-C: low-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol; TC: triglycerides. \n \nCongenital Heart Malformation Panels \nAmerican Heart Association \nThe American Heart Association published a statement entitled “Genetic Basis for Congenital Heart \nDisease: Revisited” in September 2018 (correction published in November 2018) which states the \nfollowing: “Uncovering a genetic pathogenesis for congenital HD is increasingly clinically relevant, \nin part beca\nuse of the aforementioned improved survival. For the clinician caring for a child or adult \nwith congenital HD, important reasons for determining the genetic cause can include (1) assessing \nrecurrence risks for the offspring of the congenital HD survivor, additional offspring of the parents, \nor other close relatives; (2) evaluating for associated extracardiac involvement; (3) assessing risk for \nneurodevelopmental delays for newborns and infants; and (4) providing more accurate prognosis for \nthe congenital HD and outcomes for congenital HD–related interventions.” (p. 3).  \n \nPost Heart Transplant Gene Expression Panels for Rejection Risk \nInternational Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines \nThe International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines (Constanzo et al, 2010) \nhas the following recommendations for the non-invasive monitoring of acute cellular rejection \nafter heart transplant, and specifically addresses Allomap:  \n\n \n \nConcert Genetic Testing: Cardiac Disorders \nV2.2023 \nDate of Last Revision: 3/1/2023   \n \n \n \n 32 \n “Gene Expression Profiling (Allomap) can be used to rule out the presence of ACR of \ngrade 2R or greater in appropriate low-risk patients, between 6 months and 5 years after \nHT”. (p. 926)  \n \nDonor-Derived Cell-Free DNA for Heart Transplant Rejection Khush et al (2019) \nKhush et al (2019) published a study using an Allomap registry to investigate donor-derived cell \nfree DNA in heart transplant rejection compared to biopsy results. The study included several \nprotocol changes during the course of the study, making conclusions difficult to draw. Future \ndirections highlighted in this study included clinical utility studies, but those studies have not been \npublished to date.  \nQian et al (2022) \nA recent review (Qian et al, 2022) on noninvasive biomarkers in heart transplant pointed out the \nhigh sensitivity for detection of allograft injury, but low specificity for acute rejection, and \nconcluded with the need for well-designed clinical utility studies.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7. Nonviable neonates.\nWhole exome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nRepeat whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis of genetic disorders, including re-analysis of previous test results, is considered investigational .\nWhole genome sequencing is considered investigational  for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations.\nWhole exome sequencing  and whole genome sequencing  are considered investigational  for screening for genetic disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

The WGS was performed in ‘rapid run’ mode with minimum depth of 90 Gb per \ngenome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold. \nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and, in the NICU or PICU, when the \ntest is ordered but may be discharged before results are delivered. \nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using \nchromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within rWGS if the test is validated for CNV \nanalysis. \nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology, include but are not \nlimited to any of the following: \n Choanal atresia \n Coloboma \n Hirschsprung disease \n Meconium ileus \n \nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic \nphenotype include, but are not limited to, any of the following: \n Abnormal newborn screen \n Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis \n Hyperammonemia \n Lactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion \n Refractory or severe hypoglycemia \n \nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include, but not limited to, any of the \nfollowing: \n Significant hypotonia \n Persistent seizures \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 4  \n Infant with high-risk stratification on evaluation for a brief resolved unexplained event \n(BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features: \no Recurrent events without respiratory infection \no Recurrent witnessed seizure like events \no Required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) \no Significantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate \nor lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other tests that suggest an inborn error \nof metabolism \n Significantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible \nchannelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis or structural heart disease \n Family history of: \no Arrhythmia \no BRUE in sibling \no Developmental delay \no Inborn error of metabolism or genetic disease \no Long QT syndrome (LQTS) \no Sudden unexplained death (including unexplained car accident or drowning) in first- \nor second-degree family members before age 35, and particularly as an infant \n \nBRUE \nBrief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) was previously known as apparent life-threatening \nevent (ALTE).

It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 5  \nPG1). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular \nPathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants represent expert \nopinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG1.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \nCross-Reference: \nMP 2.242  Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability, \nAutism Spectrum Disorder, and Congenital Anomalies \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 6  \nMP 2.321 Genetic Testing for Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy \nMP 2.262 Genetic Testing for Epilepsy \nMP 2.332 Genetic Testing for Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies \n \nII.

D ESCRIPTION /BACKGROUND        TOP \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing \nWhole exome sequencing (WES) is targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the subset of \nthe human genome that contains functionally important sequences of protein-coding DNA, while \nwhole genome sequencing (WGS) uses NGS techniques to sequence both coding and \nnoncoding regions of the genome. WES and WGS have been proposed for use in patients \npresenting with disorders and anomalies not explained by standard clinical workup. Potential \ncandidates for WES and WGS include patients who present with a broad spectrum of suspected \ngenetic conditions. \nGiven the variety of disorders and management approaches, there are a variety of potential \nhealth outcomes from a definitive diagnosis. In general, the outcomes of a molecular genetic \ndiagnosis include (1) impacting the search for a diagnosis, (2) informing follow-up that can \nbenefit a child by reducing morbidity, and (3) affecting reproductive planning for parents and \npotentially the affected patient. \nThe standard diagnostic workup for patients with suspected Mendelian disorders may include \ncombinations of radiographic, electrophysiologic, biochemical, biopsy, and targeted genetic \nevaluations. The search for a diagnosis may thus become a time-consuming and expensive \nprocess.  \n \nWhole Exome Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing Technology \nWES or WGS using NGS technology can facilitate obtaining a genetic diagnosis in patients \nefficiently. WES is limited to most of the protein-coding sequence of an individual (greater than \n85%), is composed of about 20,000 genes and 180,000 exons (protein-coding segments of a \ngene), and constitutes approximately 1% of the genome. It is believed that the exome contains \nabout 85% of heritable disease-causing variants. WES has the advantage of speed and \nefficiency relative to Sanger sequencing of multiple genes. WES shares some limitations with \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 7  \nSanger sequencing. For example, it will not identify the following: intronic sequences or gene \nregulatory regions; chromosomal changes; large deletions; duplications; or rearrangements \nwithin genes, nucleotide repeats, or epigenetic changes. WGS uses techniques similar \nto WES but includes noncoding regions. WGS has a greater ability to detect large deletions or \nduplications in protein-coding regions compared with WES but requires greater data analytics. \nTechnical aspects of WES and WGS are evolving, including the development of databases such \nas the National Institutes of Health’s ClinVar database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to \ncatalog variants, uneven sequencing coverage, gaps in exon capture before sequencing, and \ndifficulties with narrowing the large initial number of variants to manageable numbers without \nlosing likely candidate mutations. The variability contributed by the different platforms and \nprocedures used by different clinical laboratories offering exome sequencing as a clinical \nservice is unknown. \nIn 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, Association for Molecular \nPathology, and College of American Pathologists convened a workgroup to standardize \nterminology for describing sequence variants. In 2015, guidelines developed by this workgroup \ndescribe criteria for classifying pathogenic and benign sequence variants based on 5 categories \nof data: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, uncertain significance, likely benign, and benign. \nIn 2021, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics released their practice \nguideline for exome and genome sequencing for pediatric patients with congenital anomalies \n(CA) or intellectual disability (ID). In this guideline they strongly recommend exome sequencing \nand genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test for patients with one or more CA prior \nto one year of age or for patients with developmental delay/ID with onset prior to 18 years of \nage. They noted that isolated autism without ID or congenital malformation is formally out of \nscope for their recommendation, but that evaluation of exome/genome studies are ongoing.  \nOptical Genome Mapping \nOptical Genome Mapping (OGM) is an imaging technology which evaluates the fluorescent \nlabeling pattern of individual DNA molecules to perform an unbiased assessment of genome-\nwide structural variants down to 500 base pairs (bp) in size, a resolution that exceeds \nconventional cytogenetic approaches. OGM relies on a specifically designed extraction protocol \nfacilitating the isolation of ultra-high molecular weight DNA. In essence, this imaging technology \nconverts DNA into a “barcode” whose labeling profile and characteristics can resolve copy \nnumber and structural variation without the need to sequence level data. In germline-settings, \nwhere copy number variants (CNVs) detection is primarily performed by chromosomal \nmicroarray analysis, recent studies have shown that OGM has the capacity to detect all clinically \nrelevant variants observed by standard of care studies. OGM may have the ability to yield the \ninformation obtained from a combination of karyotyping, FISH and microarrays in one diagnostic \nwork up. \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 8  \nDespite successes, there are inherent limitations of this technology which begins with the need \nfor ultra-high weight molecular DNA. This precludes the capacity to evaluate specimens which \nhave undergone fixation or to profile DNA that was isolated using conventional extractions. \nMoreover, not all specimens may yield effective isolation, which may be influenced by pre-\nanalytical variables (specimen quality) or related to the technical performance of the isolation. \nOGM is also not presently a high-throughput technology. OGM also does not provide sequence \nlevel data and thus may require orthogonal, sequenced-based approaches to confirm certain \nclasses of structural variants (i.e., small insertional events). Finally, with its increased detection \nof cryptic structural variants, OGM may detect increased genomic variation of unknown \nsignificance and challenges current interpretative capabilities. \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). WES or WGS tests as a clinical service \nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that offer laboratory-developed tests \nmust be licensed by the CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug \nAdministration has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test. \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \nFor individuals who are children that are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes large case series and \nwithin-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes \nin reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital \nanomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology, but whose specific \ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by standard clinical workup, may be left without a \nclinical diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic workup. For a substantial \nproportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and \nsmaller series have reported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on \nthe individual’s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative study found a 44% \nincrease in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also \nreported changes in patient management, including medication changes, discontinuation of or \nadditional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey, and family planning. The evidence is sufficient \nto determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following standard workup \nwho receive WES with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes small case series and \nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. There is an increasing \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 9  \nnumber of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other \nthan multiple congenital anomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in \nthese studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on the use of a \nvirtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allows \nreanalysis as new genes are linked to the patient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WES for these disorders \nis at an early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management.  The evidence is \ninsufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital \nanomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup \nor WES who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the evidence includes \nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional \noutcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. In studies of \nchildren with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following \nstandard clinical workup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of \nstudies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only pathogenic or likely \npathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that variants of uncertain \nsignificance (VUS) were frequently not reported. In a systematic review, the pooled (9 studies, \nN=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield \nof WGS is at least as high as WES in patients without a diagnosis following standard clinical \nworkup, WGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES, and the clinical implications of \nthis are uncertain. Evidence on the diagnostic yield of WGS in patients who have no diagnosis \nfollowing WES is lacking. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in \nan improvement in the net health outcome. \n \nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple \nunexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive who receive WGS with trio testing, when possible, the \nevidence includes case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, \nchanges in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. WGS has also been studied \nin other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of \npatients have been studied for any specific disorder, and clinical use of WGS as well as \ninformation regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at an early \nstage. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health \noutcomes. \n \nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology \nfollowing standard workup who receive rapid WGS (rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio \ntesting, when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case \nseries. Relevant outcomes are test validity, functional outcomes, changes in reproductive \ndecision making, and resource utilization. One RCT comparing rapid trio WGS (rWGS) with \nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was \nterminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic diagnosis within 28 days of \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE WHOLE EXOME AND WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING FOR DIAGNOSIS OF \nGENETIC DISORDERS  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.324 \n \nEffective 2/1/2025                Page 10  \nenrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=0.003). Changes in \nmanagement due to test results were reported in 41% vs. 21% (p=0.11) of rWGS vs control \npatients; however, 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (e.g., next-generation \nsequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT compared \nrWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with diseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal \nintensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The \ndiagnostic yield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time (days) \nto result (median, 11 vs. 11 days). The NICUSeq RCT compared rWGS (test results returned in \n15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants \nadmitted to an ICU with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS \ngroup (31.0%; 95% CI 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI 10.2% to 21.3%). Additionally, \nsignificantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the \ndelayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%; p=.009; odds ratio 2.3; 95% CI 1.22 to 4.32). Several \nretrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in \ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included \nphenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of between 30% and 60% for \npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in \npatient management for patients receiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including \navoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity, discontinuation of \nor additional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of \nevidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and changes in management \nexpected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net \nhealth outcome. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nNA \n \nVI.

P OLICY               \nGenetic testing for genes associated with infantile- and early-childhood onset epilepsy \nsyndromes in individuals with infantile- and early-childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes in which \nepilepsy is the core clinical symptom (see Policy Guidelines section) may be considered \nmedically necessary if positive test results may: \n \n1. Lead to changes in medication management; AND/OR  \n2. Lead to changes in diagnostic testing such that alternative potentially invasive tests \nare avoided; AND/OR  \n3. Lead to changes in reproductive decision-making.  \nGenetic testing for epilepsy is considered investigational  for all other indications. There is \ninsufficient evidence to support a general conclusion concerning the health outcomes or \nbenefits associated with this procedure.  \nPolicy Guidelines \nApplication of Medically Necessary Policy Statement  \nAlthough there is no standard definition of epileptic encephalopathies, they are generally \ncharacterized by at least some of the following: (1) onset in early childhood (often in infancy); (2) \nrefractory to therapy; (3) associated with developmental delay or regression; and (4) severe \nelectroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities. There is a challenge in defining the population \nappropriate for testing given that specific epileptic syndromes may be associated with different \nEEG abnormalities, which may change over time, and patients may present with severe \nseizures prior to the onset or recognition of developmental delay or regression. However, for this \npolicy, the medically necessary policy statement would apply for patients with: \n1. Onset of seizures in early childhood (i.e., before the age of 5 years); AND  \n2. Clinically severe seizures that affect daily functioning and/or interictal EEG \nabnormalities; AND POLICY  PRODUCT VARIATIONS  DESCRIPTION/BACKGROUND  \nRATIONALE  DEFINITIONS   BENEFIT VARIATIONS  \nDISCLAIMER  CODING INFORMATION  REFERENCES  \nPOLICY HISTORY     \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 2  \n3. No other clinical syndrome that would potentially better explain the patient’s symptoms.  \nIncluded Tests/Conditions \nThis policy addresses testing for epilepsy that is possibly genetic.  In 2010, the International \nLeague Against Epilepsy classified epilepsy as having underlying genetic cause or etiology \nwhen, as best understood, the epilepsy is the direct result of a known or presumed genetic \ndefect and seizures are the core symptom of the disorder and for which there is no structural or \nmetabolic defect predisposing to epilepsy. The updated 2017 ILAE classification system does \nnot discuss epilepsy with a genetic cause. \nThis policy also addresses the rare epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, in which epilepsy is the core clinical symptom (e.g., Dravet syndrome, early infantile \nepileptic encephalopathy, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus, epilepsy and \nintellectual disability limited to females, nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, and others). Other \nclinical manifestations may be present in these syndromes but are generally secondary to the \nepilepsy itself. \nExcluded Tests and Conditions \nThis policy does not address testing for genetic syndromes that have a wider range of \nsymptomatology, of which seizures may be one, such as the neurocutaneous disorders (e.g., \nneurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or genetic syndromes associated with cerebral \nmalformations or abnormal cortical development, or metabolic or mitochondrial disorders. \nGenetic testing for these syndromes may be specifically addressed in other policies (see Cross-\nreference section).  \nTesting that is limited to genotyping of CYP450  genes is addressed separately (MP 2.234). \nThis policy does not address the use of genotyping for the HLA-B*1502 allelic variant in patients \nof Asian ancestry prior to considering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe \ndermatologic reactions. This testing is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) labeling for carbamazepine. \nThis policy also does not address the use of testing for variants in the mitochondrial DNA \npolymerase gamma ( POLG ) gene in patients with clinically suspected mitochondrial disorders \nprior to initiation of therapy with valproate. Valproate’s label contains a black box warning \nrelated to increased risk of acute liver failure associated with the use of valproate in patients \nwith POLG  gene-related hereditary neurometabolic syndromes. FDA labeling states: “Valproate \nis contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by variants in \nmitochondrial DNA polymerase γ (POLG; e.g., Alpers-Huttenlocher Syndrome) and children \nunder two years of age who are suspected of having a POLG-related disorder.  \nMedically Necessary Statement Definitions and Testing Strategy \nThe medically necessary statement refers to epilepsy syndromes that present in infancy or early \nchildhood, are severe, and are characterized by epilepsy as the primary manifestation, without \nassociated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. As defined by the International League \nAgainst Epilepsy, these include epileptic encephalopathies, which are electroclinical syndrome \nassociated with a high probability of encephalopathic features that present or worsen after the \nonset of epilepsy. Other clinical manifestations, including developmental delay and/or \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 3  \nintellectual disability, may be present secondary to the epilepsy itself. Specific clinical \nsyndromes based on the International League Against Epilepsy classification include: \n Dravet syndrome (also known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy \n[SMEI] or polymorphic myoclonic epilepsy in infancy [PMEI]) \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with intellectual disability) \n Epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep \n GEFS+ syndrome (generalized epilepsies with febrile seizures plus) \n Ohtahara syndrome (also known as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst \nsuppression pattern) \n Landau-Kleffner syndrome \n West syndrome  \n Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome. \nVariants in a large number of genes have been associated with early-onset epilepsies.

If there is suspicion for a specific syndrome based on history, EEG findings, and \nother test results, testing should begin with targeted variant testing for the candidate gene most \nlikely to be involved, followed by sequential testing for other candidate genes. In particular, if an \nSCN1A -associated syndrome is suspected (Dravet syndrome, GEFS+), molecular genetic \ntesting of SCN1A  with sequence analysis of the SCN1A  coding region, followed by \ndeletion/duplication analysis if a pathogenic variant is not identified, should be obtained.  \nGiven the genetic heterogeneity of early-onset epilepsy syndromes, a testing strategy that uses \na multigene panel may be considered reasonable. In these cases, panels should meet the \ncriteria outlined in MP 2.323 (General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels). \nCriteria for use of whole exome sequencing are outlined in MP 2.324 (Whole Exome and Whole \nGenome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders). \nGenetics Nomenclature Update \nThe Human Genome Variation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants \nfound in DNA and serves as an international standard in DNA diagnostics. It is being \nimplemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table \nPG2). The Society’s nomenclature is recommended by the Human Variome Project, the Human \nGenome Organization, and by the Human Genome Variation Society itself. \nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for \nMolecular Pathology (AMP) standards and guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants \nrepresent expert opinion from ACMG, AMP, and the College of American Pathologists. These \nrecommendations primarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including \ngenotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG3 shows the recommended \nstandard terminology— “pathogenic,” “likely pathogenic,” “uncertain significance,” “likely \nbenign,” and “benign”—to describe variants identified that cause Mendelian disorders. \nTable PG2.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the \nunderstanding of risk factors can be very difficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling \nwill assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of genetic testing, \nincluding the possible impact of the information on the individual's family. Genetic counseling \nmay alter the utilization of genetic testing substantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. \nGenetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in \ngenetic medicine and genetic testing methods. \n \nCross-reference:  \nMP 2.234  Cytochrome P450 Genotype Guided Treatment Strategy \nMP 2.276  Genetic Testing for FMR1  Variants (Including Fragile X Syndrome) \nMP 2.323  General Approach to Evaluating the Utility of Genetic Panels       \nMP 2.324  Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic \nDisorders  \nMP 2.326 General Approach to Genetic Testing \n \nII.

It is a common \nneurologic disorder, with approximate 3% of the population developing the disorder over their \nentire lifespan.  \nSudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is defined as a sudden, unexpected, \nnontraumatic, and non-drowning death in patients with epilepsy, excluding documented status \nepilepticus, with no cause of death identified following comprehensive postmortem evaluation.  \nClassification \nEpilepsy is heterogeneous in etiology and clinical expression and can be classified in a variety \nof ways. Most commonly, classification is done by the clinical phenotype, i.e., the type of \nseizures that occur. In 2017, the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) updated its \nclassification system that is widely used for clinical care and research purposes (see Table 1). \nClassification of seizures can also be done on the basis of age of onset: neonatal, infancy, \nchildhood, and adolescent/adult. \nTable 1.

Genetic epilepsies are characterized by recurrent unprovoked \nseizures in patients who do not have demonstrable brain lesions or metabolic abnormalities. In \naddition, seizures are the core symptom of the disorder, and other symptomatology is not \npresent, except as a direct result of seizures. This is differentiated from genetically determined \nconditions in which seizures are part of a larger syndrome, such as tuberous sclerosis, fragile X \nsyndrome, or Rett syndrome. \nThe review focuses on the category of genetic epilepsies in which seizures are the primary \nclinical manifestation. This category does not include syndromes that have multiple clinical \nmanifestations, of which seizures may be one. Examples of syndromes that include seizures are \nRett syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. Genetic testing for these syndromes will not be \nassessed herein but may be included in separate reviews that specifically address genetic \ntesting for that syndrome. \nGenetic epilepsies can be further broken down by type of seizures. For example, genetic \ngeneralized epilepsy refers to patients who have convulsive (grand mal) seizures, while genetic \nabsence epilepsy refers to patients with nonconvulsive (absence) seizures. The disorders are \nalso sometimes classified by the age of onset. \nThe category of genetic epilepsies includes a number of rare epilepsy syndromes that present in \ninfancy or early childhood. These syndromes are characterized by epilepsy as the primary \nmanifestation, without associated metabolic or brain structural abnormalities. They are often \nsevere and sometimes refractory to medication treatment. They may involve other clinical \nmanifestations such as developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, which in many cases \nare thought to be caused by frequent uncontrolled seizures. In these cases, the epileptic \nsyndrome may be classified as an epileptic encephalopathy, which is described by ILAE as \ndisorders in which the epileptic activity itself may contribute to severe cognitive and behavioral \nimpairments above and beyond what might be expected from the underlying pathology alone \nand that these can worsen over time. A partial list of severe early-onset epilepsy syndromes is \nas follows: \n Dravet syndrome \n EFMR syndrome (epilepsy limited to females with mental retardation) \n Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy \n GEFS+ syndrome (genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus) \n EIEE syndrome (early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with suppression burst) \n West syndrome \n Ohtahara syndrome \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 8  \nDravet syndrome falls on a spectrum of SCN1A- related seizure disorders, which includes febrile \nseizures at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized \ntonic-clonic seizures at the severe end. The spectrum may be associated with multiple seizure \nphenotypes, with a broad spectrum of severity; more severe seizure disorders may be \nassociated with cognitive impairment, or deterioration. Ohtahara syndrome is a severe early-\nonset epilepsy syndrome characterized by intractable tonic spasms, other seizures, interictal \nelectroencephalography abnormalities, and developmental delay. It may be secondary to \nstructural abnormalities but has been associated with variants in the STXBP1  gene in rare \ncases. West syndrome is an early-onset seizure disorder associated with infantile spasms and \nthe characteristic electroencephalography finding of hypsarrhythmia. Other seizure disorders \npresenting early in childhood may have a genetic component but are characterized by a more \nbenign course, including benign familial neonatal seizures and benign familial infantile seizures. \nGenetic Etiology \nMost genetic epilepsies are primarily believed to involve multifactorial inheritance patterns. This \nfollows the concept of a threshold effect, in which any particular genetic defect may increase the \nrisk of epilepsy but is not by itself causative. A combination of risk-associated genes, together \nwith environmental factors, determines whether the clinical phenotype of epilepsy occurs. In this \nmodel, individual genes that increase the susceptibility to epilepsy have a relatively weak \nimpact. Multiple genetic defects, and/or a particular combination of genes, probably increase the \nrisk by a greater amount. However, it is not well understood how many abnormal genes are \nrequired to exceed the threshold to cause clinical epilepsy, nor is it understood which \ncombination of genes may increase the risk more than others. \nEarly-onset epilepsy syndromes may be single-gene disorders. Because of the small amount of \nresearch available, the evidence base for these rare syndromes is incomplete, and new variants \nare currently being frequently discovered.   \nSome of the most common genes associated with genetic epileptic syndromes are listed in \nTable 2.  \nTable 2.

Ohtahara syndrome \nhas been associated with variants in STXBP1  in cases where patients have no structural or \nmetabolic abnormalities. West syndrome is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities or \ntuberous sclerosis or may be secondary to an identifiable infectious or metabolic cause, but \nwhen there is no underlying cause identified, it is thought to be due to a multifactorial genetic \npredisposition.   \nColl et al (2016) evaluated the use of a custom resequencing panel including genes related to \nsudden death, epilepsy, and SUDEP. New potential candidate genes for SUDEP were detected: \nFBN1, HCN1, SCN4A, EFHC1, CACNA1A, SCN11A, and SCN10A. \nTargeted testing for individual genes is available. Several commercial epilepsy genetic panels \nare also available. The number of genes included in the tests varies widely, from about 50 to \nover 450. The panels frequently include genes for other disorders such as neural tube defects, \nlysosomal storage disorders, cardiac channelopathies, congenital disorders of glycosylation, \nmetabolic disorders, neurologic syndromes, and multisystemic genetic syndromes. Some \npanels are designed to be comprehensive while other panels target specific subtypes of \nepilepsy. Chambers et al (2016) reviewed comprehensive epilepsy panels from 7 U.S.-based \nclinical laboratories and found that between 1% and 4% of panel contents were genes not \nknown to be associated with primary epilepsy. Between 1% and 70% of the genes included on \nan individual panel were not on any other panel. \nTreatment \nThe condition is generally chronic, requiring treatment with one or more medications to \nadequately control symptoms. Seizures can be controlled by antiepileptic medications in most \ncases, but some patients are resistant to medications, and further options such as surgery, \nvagus nerve stimulation, and/or the ketogenic diet can be used.   \nPharmacogenomics \nAnother area of interest for epilepsy is the pharmacogenomics of antiepileptic medications. \nThere are a wide variety of these medications, from numerous different classes. The choice of \nmedications, and the combinations of medications for patients who require treatment with more \nthan 1 agent is complex. Approximately one-third of patients are considered refractory to \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 10  \nmedications, defined as inadequate control of symptoms with a single medication. These \npatients often require escalating doses and/or combinations of different medications. At present, \nselection of agents is driven by the clinical phenotype of seizures but has a large trial-and-error \ncomponent in many refractory cases. The current focus of epilepsy pharmacogenomics is in \ndetecting genetic markers that identify patients likely to be refractory to the most common \nmedications. This may lead to directed treatment that will result in a more efficient process for \nmedication selection, and potentially more effective control of symptoms. \nOf note, genotyping for the HLA-B *1502 allelic variant in patients of Asian ancestry, prior to \nconsidering drug treatment with carbamazepine due to risks of severe dermatologic reactions, is \nrecommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling for carbamazepine.   \nRegulatory Status \nClinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory \nservice; laboratory-developed tests must meet the general regulatory standards of the Clinical \nLaboratory Improvement Amendments. Commercially available genetic tests for epilepsy are \navailable under the auspices of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories \nthat offer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement \nAmendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has \nchosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.  \n \nIV. R ATIONALE          TOP \n \nSUMMARY OF EVIDENCE \n \nFor individuals who have infantile- or early-childhood-onset epileptic encephalopathy who \nreceive testing for genes associated with epileptic encephalopathies, the evidence includes \nprospective and retrospective cohort studies describing the testing yield. Relevant outcomes are \ntest accuracy and validity, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For Dravet syndrome, which appears to \nhave the largest body of associated literature, the sensitivity of testing for SCN1A  disease-\nassociated variants is high ( 80%). For other early-onset epileptic encephalopathies, the true \nclinical sensitivity and specificity of testing are not well-defined. However, studies reporting on \nthe overall testing yield in populations with epileptic encephalopathies and early-onset epilepsy \nhave reported detection rates for clinically significant variants ranging from 7.5% to 57%. The \nclinical utility of genetic testing occurs primarily when there is a positive test for a known \npathogenic variant. The presence of a pathogenic variant may lead to targeted medication \nmanagement, avoidance of other diagnostic tests, and/or informed reproductive planning. The \nevidence is sufficient to determine that the technology results in a meaningful improvement in \nthe net health outcome. \nFor individuals who have presumed genetic epilepsy who receive testing for genetic variants \nassociated with genetic epilepsies, the evidence includes prospective and retrospective cohort \nstudies describing testing yields. Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, changes in \nreproductive decision making, symptoms, quality of life, functional outcomes, medication use, \nresource utilization, and treatment-related morbidity. For most genetic epilepsies, which are \n\nMEDICAL POLICY    \nPOLICY TITLE GENETIC TESTING FOR EPILEPSY  \nPOLICY NUMBER  MP 2.262 \n \nEffective 10/1/2024                Page 11  \nthought to have a complex, multifactorial basis, the association between specific genetic \nvariants and the risk of epilepsy is uncertain. Despite a large body of literature on associations \nbetween genetic variants and epilepsies, the clinical validity of genetic testing is poorly \nunderstood. Published literature is characterized by weak and inconsistent associations, which \nhave not been replicated independently or by meta-analyses. A number of studies have also \nreported associations between genetic variants and AED treatment response, AED adverse \neffect risk, epilepsy phenotype, and risk of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy. The largest \nnumber of these studies is related to AED pharmacogenomics, which has generally reported \nsome association between variants in a number of genes (including SCN1A , SCN2A , ABCC2 , \nEPHX1 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 ), and  AED response. Similarly, genetic associations between a \nnumber of genes and AED-related adverse events have been reported. However, no empirical \nevidence on the clinical utility of testing for the genetic epilepsies was identified, and the \nchanges in clinical management that might occur as a result of testing are not well defined. The \nevidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. \n \nV. D EFINITIONS          TOP \nN/A \n \nVI.
