Case1,BRCA1/2,False,"NO
A 60-year-old adult being managed by a developmental pediatrician is unrealistic because pediatric subspecialists do not ordinarily provide ongoing care for older adults."
Case2,WES,True,"A 25-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer is being evaluated with whole exome sequencing (WES) after a chromosomal microarray (CMA) was non-diagnostic; the test was ordered by his obstetrician, he has not undergone pre-test genetic counseling, and his reported family history includes a sibling with global developmental delay, with coverage through Cigna."
Case3,WES,True,"A 12-year-old is undergoing evaluation for dysmorphic facial features and whole exome sequencing (WES) has been ordered by a gynecologist after prior karyotype testing was non-diagnostic; the family history is notable for a mother with autism spectrum disorder, the patient is insured by Cigna, and pre-test genetic counseling was offered but declined."
Case4,WGS,False,"NO
The requested testing is for prostate cancer risk/management, which is an adult-only clinical indication and is inconsistent with the patient’s age of 9 years."
Case5,CMA,False,"NO
A 5-week-old infant cannot have a personal history of exocrine pancreatic cancer, which is an adult-onset diagnosis incompatible with the neonatal age."
Case6,WES,False,"NO
Multiple congenital anomalies are a pediatric presentation and thus are inconsistent with a 72-year-old patient."
Case7,WES,True,"A 2-year-old child with unexplained epileptic encephalopathy with onset before age three, and no prior epilepsy multigene panel testing, is being evaluated by a neonatologist who has ordered whole exome sequencing (WES) with coverage through Cigna; prior FISH testing was performed and was non-diagnostic, no pre-test genetic counseling has been conducted, and there is a family history of breast cancer in the mother diagnosed at or before age 50."
Case8,CMA_developmental_disorder,True,"A 14-year-old with multiple congenital anomalies not consistent with a well-delineated genetic syndrome is being referred for chromosomal microarray analysis for developmental disorders (CMA) after a prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) was non-diagnostic; the ordering provider is a Family Medicine Physician and the patient has seen a genetic counselor multiple times. The family history is notable for three relatives with breast cancer — the patient's mother, maternal grandmother, and a maternal aunt. Insurance for testing is BCBS_FEP."
Case9,CMA,False,"NO
Meconium ileus is a neonatal condition presenting at or shortly after birth and cannot plausibly be the indication for testing in an 18-year-old."
Case10,CMA_developmental_disorder,False,"NO
The clinical indication is for invasive prenatal testing but the listed patient is 69 years old, which is incompatible with a prenatal/fetal context."
Case11,CMA_developmental_disorder,True,"A 64-year-old individual with longstanding dysmorphic features is being evaluated with a chromosomal microarray (CMA) to assess for an underlying developmental disorder; there has been no prior genetic testing, and the family history is notable for a brother who was diagnosed with moderate-to-severe intellectual disability by age 18. The test was ordered by a nurse practitioner, insurance coverage is through Cigna, and there is no documentation of pretest genetic counseling."
Case12,CMA_developmental_disorder,True,"The patient is a 3-year-old with congenital coloboma, and because of a sibling with moderate-to-severe intellectual disability diagnosed by age 18, the Family Medicine Physician has ordered chromosomal microarray analysis for developmental disorders; there has been no prior genetic testing, the family declined pre-test genetic counseling, and the testing will be billed to Cigna."
Case13,CMA_developmental_disorder,True,"A 10-year-old child is being evaluated for a history of abnormal muscle tone dating back to infancy, described as episodes of hypotonia or hypertonia, and chromosomal microarray testing for developmental disorders is being pursued; prior FISH testing was performed and was non-diagnostic.

Breast cancer is an adult-onset condition and is biologically implausible as a clinical indication in a 1-year-old child."
Case31,WES,False,"NO
A 68-year-old adult being managed by a general pediatrician is unrealistic."
Case32,CMA,False,"NO
This is unrealistic because lobular breast cancer and diffuse gastric cancer are adult-onset conditions and it is essentially impossible for a 5-year-old to have lobular breast carcinoma."
Case33,CMA,True,"At 14 weeks’ gestation, a fetus is being evaluated for a major structural congenital abnormality affecting at least one organ system and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) has been requested after prior FISH testing was non-diagnostic; the pregnancy is managed by a gynecologist, the patient declined genetic counseling, and there is a family history notable for breast cancer in a paternal uncle who was assigned male at birth, with testing to be billed through UHC."
