Family history is notable for a maternal uncle reported to have a movement disorder with dystonia and ataxia. Testing is being submitted with coverage through Cigna and the developmental pediatrician will coordinate result disclosure and any recommended follow-up with genetics."
Case8149,CMA_developmental_disorder,Set 1,False,"NO
The case is inconsistent because the indication describes fetal structural anomalies yet the patient is an 18-year-old, so a prenatal/fetal testing context is not appropriate."
Case8149,CMA_developmental_disorder,Set 2,False,"NO
The indication describes fetal structural anomalies and prenatal testing but the record lists an 18-year-old rather than a fetal/prenatal case, making the prenatal phrasing inconsistent with the provided age."
Case8149,CMA_developmental_disorder,Set 3,False,"NO
The clinical indication refers to fetal structural anomalies but the patient is 18 years old, and prenatal/fetal testing scenarios are only valid when the case represents a fetus."
Case10075,CMA_developmental_disorder,Set 1,True,"A four-week-old infant was seen by a developmental pediatrician for meconium ileus and consideration of chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing to evaluate for an underlying chromosomal or genetic etiology. Prior chromosomal microarray testing was nondiagnostic and there is a family history of an inborn error of metabolism in a sibling, raising concern for a heritable disorder. Pre-test counseling was completed with a genetic specialist and arrangements for post-test follow-up were discussed, and testing will be pursued with coverage through BCBS_FEP."
Case10075,CMA_developmental_disorder,Set 2,True,The patient is a 4-week-old infant presenting with meconium ileus who was referred by a developmental pediatrician for chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing to evaluate for an underlying genetic etiology. A prior CMA was nondiagnostic and a sibling is reported to have an inborn error of metabolism. Pre-test counseling was discussed with a genetic specialist and testing will be pursued with coverage through the Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal Employee Program (FEP).
Case10075,CMA_developmental_disorder,Set 3,True,"An infant aged 4 weeks was evaluated by the developmental pediatrician for meconium ileus and chromosomal microarray (CMA) for developmental disorder evaluation has been ordered; a prior chromosomal microarray was nondiagnostic, and there is a family history of an inborn error of metabolism in an older sibling, with pre-test counseling completed with a genetic specialist and testing planned with coverage through BCBS_FEP."
Case2783,CMA,Set 1,False,"NO
This is unrealistic because choanal atresia is a congenital pediatric anomaly and is not an appropriate current indication for genetic testing in a 68-year-old adult."
Case2783,CMA,Set 2,True,"A 68-year-old with a history of choanal atresia is being evaluated by the primary care physician and referred for chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing to assess for an underlying genomic etiology given the congenital airway anomaly and a reported sibling with epileptic encephalopathy with onset before three years of age; prior fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing was nondiagnostic, the patient declined genetic counseling, and testing will be pursued with coverage through Cigna."
Case2783,CMA,Set 3,True,"The patient is a 68-year-old who was referred by the primary care physician for chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing to evaluate longstanding choanal atresia diagnosed in childhood, and prior fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing was nondiagnostic; the patient reports a sibling with epileptic encephalopathy with onset before age three, declined genetic counseling, and has coverage through Cigna."
Case9773,CMA,Set 1,True,"The two-year-old is undergoing evaluation for severe intellectual disability with chromosomal microarray (CMA) ordered to assess for genomic copy number changes; there is no prior genetic testing on record. The study was ordered by the child's oncologist given concern for an underlying genetic etiology and there is a family history of a maternal aunt with a persistent and severe immunologic disorder. The family has coverage through the Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal Employee Program (FEP), and they completed pre-test genetic counseling with plans to return for post-test counseling after results are available."
Case9773,CMA,Set 2,True,"The two-year-old patient was referred by an oncologist for chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing because of global developmental delays concerning moderate to severe intellectual disability identified in early childhood, and no prior genetic testing has been performed; there is a family history of a maternal uncle with a persistent and severe immunologic or hematologic disorder, the family has coverage through BCBS_FEP, and they completed pre-test counseling with a genetic counselor with plans for post-test follow-up."
Case9773,CMA,Set 3,True,"The patient is a 2-year-old referred by the child's oncologist for chromosomal microarray (CMA) to evaluate moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) noted in early childhood; no prior genetic testing has been performed. The family reports a sibling with a persistent and severe immunologic or hematologic disorder, and the parents completed pre-test counseling with a genetic counselor and plan post-test follow-up. Testing is being pursued with coverage through BCBS_FEP."
Case10170,CMA,Set 1,False,"NO
The clinical indication specifies invasive prenatal testing yet the patient is an 8-year-old child, so prenatal/fetal testing is inconsistent with the patient's age."
Case10170,CMA,Set 2,False,"NO
The indication describes invasive prenatal testing but the patient is an 8-year-old child, so a prenatal/fetal testing indication is not appropriate."
Case10170,CMA,Set 3,False,"NO
The clinical indication specifies invasive prenatal testing for a fetus but the patient is an 8-year-old child, so prenatal/fetal testing phrasing is not appropriate."
