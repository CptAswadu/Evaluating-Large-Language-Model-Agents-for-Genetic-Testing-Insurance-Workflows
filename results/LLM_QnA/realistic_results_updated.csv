Case1,CMA_developmental_disorder,True,"At birth, this neonate, currently 0 weeks old, presents with neurodevelopmental concerns including dystonia and ataxia as well as other movement abnormalities suggesting a neuromuscular disorder. A karyotype analysis performed previously was non-diagnostic. Chromosomal microarray testing for developmental disorders has been ordered by a medical geneticist to further evaluate the presentation. A genetic counselor discussed the case with a genetics specialist. The patient is insured through Blue Cross Blue Shield Federal Employee Program (BCBS FEP). There is a family history in a parent or sibling with a persistent and severe immunologic or hematologic disorder."
Case2,WES,True,"A 54-year-old woman with intellectual disability diagnosed by age 18 is being evaluated for a genetic etiology; prior karyotype testing was non-diagnostic. She has a sibling with a history of moderate to profound intellectual disability diagnosed by age 18. She is insured by Cigna. A gynecologist has ordered whole-exome sequencing, and she has consulted a genetic counselor on multiple occasions to discuss the diagnostic implications and plan follow-up."
Case3,WGS,True,"The patient is a 60-year-old adult referred for genetic evaluation of a constellation of congenital anomalies that do not point to a well-defined genetic syndrome. A family history is notable for an inborn error of metabolism. Prior testing includes a karyotype, which was non-diagnostic. Whole genome sequencing is being pursued to clarify the underlying genetic etiology and inform management. The evaluation has been initiated by a medical geneticist, with no genetic counseling conducted to date but planned as part of follow-up. The case is insured by Cigna."
Case4,WGS,True,"At 36 weeks’ gestation, a fetus is being evaluated for apparent nonsyndromic developmental delay with potential intellectual impairment, and whole-genome sequencing is planned. Prior FISH testing was non-diagnostic. The ordering clinician is an oncologist, and no genetic counseling has yet been conducted. A family history reveals that a parent or sibling has dysmorphic features, which may indicate a hereditary component. The case is covered by BCBS_FEP, and the plan is to perform WGS, interpret the results with a genetic counselor, and arrange appropriate postnatal follow-up with the ordering clinician after results are available."
Case5,CMA,True,"A 14-year-old patient presents with moderate to profound intellectual disability diagnosed by adolescence. Prior karyotype testing was non-diagnostic, and chromosomal microarray testing (CMA) is being ordered to further characterize the genetic etiology. There is a family history of unexplained developmental regression in a close relative, such as a parent or a sibling, unrelated to autism or epilepsy. The evaluation is being coordinated by a medical geneticist, with a genetic counselor who has discussed the case with a genetics specialist. The patient is insured by BCBS_FEP, and CMA is planned as the primary genetic test to guide prognosis and management."
Case6,BRCA1/2,True,"A 13-year-old patient with global developmental delay underwent a chromosomal microarray test previously reported as non-diagnostic, and BRCA1/2 genetic testing was ordered by an obstetrician with planned follow-up by a genetic counselor who declined counseling at this time. Family history reveals that the patient’s mother developed breast cancer before age 50. Insurance coverage is BCBS_FEP."
Case7,CMA,True,"At 66 years of age, the patient underwent a chromosomal microarray analysis to evaluate a presentation of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia not attributed to total parenteral nutrition–associated cholestasis. Prior testing included fluorescence in situ hybridization, which was non-diagnostic. The evaluation was ordered by a neurologist, and the patient declined genetic counseling. There is a family history of pancreatic cancer in a parent. Insurance coverage is provided by UnitedHealthcare."
Case8,BRCA1/2,False,"NO
BRCA1/2 testing ordered by a neonatologist for a 2-year-old with developmental delay is unrealistic, since BRCA testing is intended for adults and a neonatologist would not typically manage a toddler."
Case9,CMA_tumor,True,"Nine-year-old patient is referred for genetic evaluation by a neurologist due to a congenital abnormality affecting a single organ system that, together with a family history suggestive of a genetic basis, strongly points to a genetic etiology. Prior testing included Fragile X analysis, which was non-diagnostic. The family history includes a mother diagnosed with breast cancer at age 50 or younger, raising consideration of hereditary cancer risk that informs testing decisions. The planned test is chromosomal microarray analysis to assess for copy number variants; no genetic counseling has been conducted to date, and the workup is being pursued under UnitedHealthcare (UHC) with the ordering neurologist and a genetic counselor planned for follow-up after testing."
Case10,CMA_developmental_disorder,False,"NO
A fetus cannot be diagnosed with global developmental delay, a pediatric neurodevelopmental condition, making the indication temporally impossible for a 20-week gestation prenatal evaluation."
Case11,WES,False,"NO
Prenatal context is invalid because age_years is 0 instead of -1, yet the age string indicates a 7‑week gestational fetus."
Case12,WGS,True,"A 14-year-old adolescent presents with congenital choanal atresia. Previous chromosomal microarray testing was non-diagnostic, and whole-genome sequencing is being pursued to evaluate a possible genetic etiology. The test has been ordered by an obstetrician, and the patient is insured through BCBS_FEP. There is a sibling with hypotonia in infancy, suggesting a potential hereditary contribution. No genetic counseling has been conducted to date."
Case13,BRCA1/2,False,"NO
Testing a 10-year-old for BRCA1/2 to assess Lynch syndrome risk is unrealistic because BRCA testing and Lynch-related cancer risk assessment are adult indications and such testing is not typically performed in children."
Case14,CMA,True,"A 4-week-old infant is being evaluated for chromosomal microarray analysis of products of conception following a prior pregnancy loss to identify potential copy-number abnormalities in the fetal tissue. There have been no prior genetic tests. The ordering clinician is an oncologist, and genetic counseling was declined prior to testing. There is a family history of a sibling with unexplained developmental regression, unrelated to autism or epilepsy. Insurance is BCBS_FEP. The genetic test of interest is CMA; no other tests are indicated at this time."
Case15,WES,False,"NO
An 8-week-old infant cannot have a personal history of colorectal polyposis with ten adenomas, making the scenario biologically and developmentally unrealistic."
Case16,CMA_tumor,False,"NO
The case is unrealistic because a constitutional intellectual disability in a 52-year-old would not be evaluated with a tumor-based chromosomal microarray (CMA_tumor); germline CMA on non-tumor tissue would be appropriate instead."
Case17,CMA_tumor,False,"NO
An adult aged 71 with a pediatric indication such as Global Developmental Delay is unrealistic."
Case18,WGS,True,"A 26-year-old adult is undergoing genetic evaluation for a history of hypotonia noted in infancy. The referral comes from a family medicine physician, with no prior genetic testing performed. A genetic counselor has met with the patient multiple times as part of pre-test counseling. The planned testing is whole genome sequencing to assess potential inherited neuromuscular or multisystem conditions, given the past history and current family history. The patient has a mother with ovarian cancer, indicating a possible hereditary cancer predisposition. The patient is insured through Cigna. No diagnoses or lab results are provided yet."
Case19,CMA,True,"A 45-year-old patient is being evaluated by an oncologist for a persistent and severe immunologic or hematologic disorder. Previously, a karyotype analysis was performed and was non-diagnostic. To evaluate for potential constitutional genomic abnormalities, a chromosomal microarray is being ordered. There is a family history of a congenital anomaly in a close relative (a parent or sibling). No genetic counseling has been conducted to date. Insurance coverage is through BCBS Federal Employee Program (BCBS_FEP)."
Case20,WGS,False,"NO
A fetus cannot have a personal history of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, making the indication biologically impossible in a prenatal context."
Case21,BRCA1/2,True,"The patient is a 9-year-old child referred for genetic evaluation due to Hirschsprung disease. A prior karyotype test was non-diagnostic. The referral was placed by a pediatric neurologist, and BRCA1/2 genetic testing has been ordered. The patient is insured by Cigna. A close relative, such as a parent or sibling, has a neuropsychiatric condition (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder). Genetic counseling was not documented in the record."
Case22,WES,True,"Five-year-old child with isolated severe congenital heart disease is referred for genetic evaluation; prior FISH testing was non-diagnostic. The patient is insured through Cigna. A whole exome sequencing study has been ordered to identify a possible genetic basis for the cardiac phenotype. The ordering provider is the primary care physician, and the family has seen a genetic counselor on multiple occasions with planned follow-up. The family history is notable for sudden unexplained death in a first- or second-degree relative before age 35 (for example, a parent or sibling)."
Case23,CMA,False,"NO
A 5-year-old with a personal history of breast cancer is clinically unrealistic, since breast cancer is an adult-onset disease and not expected in early childhood."
Case24,WGS,False,"NO
Adult age 28 with a pediatric neurologist as ordering provider is unrealistic per age–provider impossibilities."
Case25,BRCA1/2,True,"At 19 weeks’ gestation, a fetus is being evaluated for risk of a childhood intellectual disability that would be diagnosed by age 18, in the setting of a family history of a pathogenic BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 variant in a parent or grandparent. Prior karyotype testing was non-diagnostic. BRCA1/BRCA2 genetic testing is planned, ordered by a neurologist, to assess inherited cancer susceptibility genes in the family. Insurance coverage is through Cigna."
Case26,BRCA1/2,False,"NO
An adult (18 years) with a neonatologist as ordering provider is unrealistic."
Case27,CMA_developmental_disorder,True,"A 10-year-old child is being evaluated after referral from a neurologist for congenital choanal atresia, with no prior genetic testing performed. The patient has a family history significant for autism spectrum disorder in a sibling. A chromosomal microarray analysis for developmental disorders is planned to assess a possible genomic etiology. Genetic counseling is not documented in the record. The case is insured by Cigna."
Case28,WGS,True,"A newborn neonate (0 years old) is being evaluated for congenital choanal atresia by a developmental pediatrician, with a non-diagnostic prior karyotype test. Whole-genome sequencing has been ordered to look for an underlying genetic etiology in the context of a family history in a sibling with laboratory abnormalities suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism. A genetic counselor was seen prior to testing and will follow up after results are received. The patient is covered by UnitedHealthcare (UHC) insurance."
Case29,BRCA1/2,False,"NO
An adult patient (70 years old) cannot have a prenatal fetal indication like fetal hydrops, which is inappropriate for age_years >= 0."
Case30,WES,False,"NO
Adult age (38 years) with a pediatrician as the ordering provider is unrealistic."
Case31,WES,False,"NO
BRUE is an infant-specific entity, so a 9-year-old with BRUE is biologically/temporally impossible."
Case32,CMA_tumor,False,"NO
Prenatal indications such as fetal hydrops are not realistic for a patient aged 13 years."
Case33,CMA_tumor,False,"NO
An adult patient aged 72 being ordered for genetic testing by a general pediatrician is unrealistic."
Case34,CMA_tumor,True,"At 16 weeks’ gestation, a fetus is being evaluated for potential neurodevelopmental risk in the context of a history of intellectual disability that would be diagnosed by age 18, with a prior chromosomal microarray analysis that was non-diagnostic. The testing was ordered by a neurologist, and the patient is insured through BCBS FEP. The genetic testing involved is chromosomal microarray analysis. The family history includes a grandparent who has had two or more cancers associated with Lynch syndrome, indicating hereditary cancer risk, and no genetic counseling is documented in the record."
Case35,CMA_developmental_disorder,True,"At 49 years of age, the patient is being evaluated by a Medical Geneticist for lifelong intellectual disability that was first diagnosed by age 18 and is described as moderate to profound in severity. A chromosomal microarray analysis for developmental disorder is planned to identify copy-number variants contributing to the phenotype. There have been no prior genetic tests.

Meconium ileus typically presents in newborns, so a 19-year-old with this indication is clinically unrealistic."
Case38,WES,True,"A 6-year-old child with profound intellectual disability had a prior chromosomal microarray which was non-diagnostic. Whole exome sequencing was ordered by the child’s primary care physician to pursue a molecular diagnosis, with the patient insured by Cigna. Family history includes a sibling with laboratory abnormalities suggestive of an inborn error of metabolism, supporting a possible heritable neurodevelopmental disorder. No genetic counseling has been conducted to date."
Case39,CMA_tumor,True,"At 70 years of age, the patient presents with multiple congenital anomalies noted since birth without a clearly delineated genetic syndrome, and a sibling has hypotonia in infancy, suggesting possible hereditary involvement. There have been no prior genetic tests. An order was placed by a nurse practitioner for chromosomal microarray testing on a tumor specimen, with planned follow-up and interpretation by a genetic specialist and genetic counselor. The patient is insured through BCBS_FEP."
Case40,CMA,True,"At 6 years of age, the patient presents with multiple congenital anomalies. The evaluation is being pursued by a medical geneticist, with prior karyotype testing that was non-diagnostic, and chromosomal microarray is now being ordered to assess for copy-number variants and other genomic etiologies.
