Case503,WES,True,"The 2-year-old is being evaluated for a high-risk brief resolved unexplained event with recurrent witnessed seizure-like episodes, and whole exome sequencing (WES) is being ordered to investigate a possible genetic etiology; chromosomal microarray (CMA) was previously performed and was non-diagnostic. Family history is notable for a parent with consanguinity. The test was ordered by a Nurse Practitioner, the child saw a genetic counselor prior to testing and will have follow-up with the counselor after results are received, and insurance is BCBS_FEP."
Case811,WES,True,"A 7-week-old infant is being evaluated for an early-onset movement disorder characterized by dystonia with ataxia and hemiplegia, and chromosomal microarray (CMA) was non-diagnostic so whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued; the evaluation was ordered by the general pediatrician, the family reports an affected sibling with multiple congenital anomalies, the patient has BCBS_FEP insurance, and a genetic counselor was seen before testing with plans to return for post-test counseling."
Case17,WES,True,"A 4-year-old child is being evaluated for unexplained epileptic encephalopathy with onset before age three and no prior epilepsy multigene panel testing; chromosomal microarray (CMA) was previously performed and was non-diagnostic. The pediatric neurologist is ordering whole exome sequencing (WES) for diagnostic evaluation, and pre-test counseling was discussed with a genetic specialist. There is a family history of an uncle with unexplained developmental regression unrelated to autism or epilepsy, and the family has Cigna insurance."
Case884,WES,False,"NO
This is a prenatal case (32 weeks’ gestation) described with neurologic/neurodevelopmental abnormalities, which is unrealistic because prenatal scenarios cannot be presented with neurodevelopmental risk."
Case647,WES,False,"NO
A prenatal (17 weeks' gestation) case cannot validly present with developmental regression or other neurodevelopmental features, so the indication is unrealistic."
Case710,WES,False,"NO
A diagnosis of intrauterine fetal demise or stillbirth is incompatible with a 73-year-old patient, so the clinical context and age are inconsistent."
Case373,WES,True,"At 25 weeks’ gestation, a fetus is being evaluated for multiple congenital anomalies that do not fit a well-delineated genetic syndrome, and the obstetrician has ordered whole exome sequencing (WES) after prior FISH testing was non-diagnostic; the family history is notable for the patient’s father having had breast cancer and the insurance is UHC."
Case120,WES,False,"NO
This case is unrealistic because a neonatologist managing a 15-year-old adolescent is not appropriate."
Case661,WES,False,"NO
A 2-week-old neonate cannot have multiple primary breast cancers, so the clinical indication is incompatible with the patient's age."
Case13,WES,True,"The patient is a newborn (0 weeks of age) being evaluated for multiple congenital anomalies that do not fit a well-delineated genetic syndrome; prior karyotype testing was non-diagnostic, and the General Pediatrician has ordered whole exome sequencing (WES).

A Nurse Practitioner has ordered whole exome sequencing (WES) under Cigna, and testing was discussed with a genetic specialist."
Case333,WES,False,"NO
Global developmental delay is a pediatric-only diagnosis and is not a realistic clinical indication for a 59-year-old adult."
Case457,WES,False,"NO
A 70-year-old described as having multiple congenital anomalies is unrealistic because congenital anomalies are pediatric-onset findings and this indication is inconsistent with a clearly elderly patient."
Case794,WES,False,"NO
Prenatal testing at 21 weeks’ gestation is not appropriate for an indication of hypotonia or hypertonia in infancy, because prenatal cases cannot be framed as postnatal neurodevelopmental concerns."
