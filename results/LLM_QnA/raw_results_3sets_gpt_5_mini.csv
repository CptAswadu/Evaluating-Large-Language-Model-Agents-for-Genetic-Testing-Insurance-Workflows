Insurance for testing is BCBS_FEP."
Case2007,BRCA1/2,Set 2,True,"The patient is an 18-year-old presenting with metastatic breast cancer for whom BRCA1/2 testing has been ordered by the family medicine physician; prior chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) was non-diagnostic.

Case1695,BRCA1/2,Set 1,False,"NO
This is a prenatal case (27 weeks' gestation) but includes a neurodevelopmental indication (""global developmental delay""), and prenatal cases must not list neurodevelopmental or developmental delay outcomes for fetal testing."
Case1695,BRCA1/2,Set 2,False,"NO
This request is unrealistic because it proposes BRCA1/2 testing on a 27-week gestation fetus and uses a prenatal neurodevelopmental indication (global developmental delay), whereas adult-onset cancer testing and neurodevelopmental labels are not appropriate in the prenatal setting."
Case1695,BRCA1/2,Set 3,False,"NO
This is a prenatal case at 27 weeks' gestation, but BRCA1/2 testing for a fetus and citing global developmental delay as an indication in the prenatal context are not appropriate."
Case1708,BRCA1/2,Set 1,False,"NO
This is unrealistic because ordering BRCA1/2 adult hereditary cancer testing for a 14-year-old being evaluated for significant hypotonia represents a contextual inconsistency between a pediatric neurologic indication and adult-onset cancer susceptibility testing."
Case1708,BRCA1/2,Set 2,False,"NO
The scenario is unrealistic because BRCA1/2 adult hereditary cancer testing is being ordered for a 14-year-old in the context of significant hypotonia, which mixes adult-onset cancer testing with a pediatric neuromuscular presentation and is not an appropriate testing context."
Case1708,BRCA1/2,Set 3,False,"NO
The request is unrealistic because BRCA1/2 hereditary cancer testing for adult-onset cancer is inconsistent with a pediatric evaluation for significant hypotonia in a 14-year-old, creating a contextual mismatch."
Case1728,BRCA1/2,Set 1,False,"NO
Testing a 31-week gestation fetus for adult-onset cancer susceptibility (BRCA1/2) is not appropriate because prenatal genetic testing is limited to karyotype, chromosomal microarray, or exome/genome sequencing and does not include single-gene BRCA testing for adult-onset cancer."
Case1728,BRCA1/2,Set 2,False,"NO
BRCA1/2 testing for a 31-week fetus is unrealistic because prenatal genetic testing is limited to karyotype, chromosomal microarray, or exome/genome sequencing and adult-onset cancer susceptibility testing is not appropriate in a fetus."
Case1728,BRCA1/2,Set 3,False,"NO
BRCA1/2 testing is an adult-onset cancer susceptibility single-gene test and is not appropriate for a fetus at 31 weeks' gestation, as prenatal testing is limited to karyotype, chromosomal microarray, or exome/genome sequencing."
Case1817,BRCA1/2,Set 1,False,"NO
BRCA1/2 testing is inappropriate for a fetus at 38 weeks gestation because prenatal testing is limited to karyotype, CMA, or prenatal WES/WGS and adult-onset cancer susceptibility single-gene testing on a fetus is not realistic."
Case1817,BRCA1/2,Set 2,False,"NO
Testing BRCA1/2 on a 38-week gestation fetus is inappropriate because adult-onset cancer susceptibility testing is not performed prenatally, and the prenatal context also must not include neurodevelopmental family history such as early-onset epileptic encephalopathy."
Case1817,BRCA1/2,Set 3,False,"NO
This is unrealistic because BRCA1/2 testing is inappropriate for a fetus (prenatal testing should be limited to karyotype, CMA, or WES/WGS) and the prenatal context cannot include neurodevelopmental family history such as early-onset epileptic encephalopathy."
