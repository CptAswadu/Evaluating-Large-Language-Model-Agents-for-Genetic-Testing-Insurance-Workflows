    "patient_info": "The patient is a 7-year-old child with a congenital anomaly present since birth who was referred by the general practitioner for whole genome sequencing (WGS) after fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing was nondiagnostic. The family history is notable for a maternal aunt with pancreatic cancer and the family has coverage through UHC. The patient has been seen multiple times by a genetic counselor for pre-test counseling and plans for post-test follow-up are in place. WGS is being pursued to provide a comprehensive genomic evaluation given the longstanding congenital findings and prior nondiagnostic targeted testing.",
