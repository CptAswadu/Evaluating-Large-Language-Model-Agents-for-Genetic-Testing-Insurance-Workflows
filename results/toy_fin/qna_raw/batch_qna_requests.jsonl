Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
