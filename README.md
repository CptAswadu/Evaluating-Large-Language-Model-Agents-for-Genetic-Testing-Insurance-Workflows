## 🧠 Purpose

This study systematically evaluates the reliability of web-search-enabled LLM agents in supporting insurance workflows for **genetic testing**.
We assess performance across four sequential tasks:

1. **In-Network Insurance Provider Retrieval** 
2. **Policy Document Retrieval**
3. **Patient-Policy Matching**
4. **LLM Agent for Answering Relevant Questions**

The goal is to quantify retrieval sensitivity, ranking robustness, and downstream decision accuracy.

## 🧪 Experimental Tasks

1. **In-Network Provider Retrieval**  
   - Task: Identify insurance companies that are in-network with GeneDx.  
   - Input: Prompted queries via ChatGPT and Perplexity.  
   - Output: JSON list of providers → Compared with `In-Network_providers_Update.csv`.

2. **Policy Document Retrieval**  
   - Task: Retrieve official genetic testing policy documents (PDFs or web pages).  
   - Output: Structured JSON with `pdf_links` and `webpage_links`.

3. **Patient-Policy Matching**  
   - Task: Given a patient-specific information, retrieve the best policy utlizing RAG.  
   - Output: Rank, policy name

4. **LLM Agent for Answering Relevant Questions**  
   - Task: Given a policy document and patient-specific information, answer key insurance-related questions.  
   - Examples: Will the test be approved? Is pre-authorization required? Is the age criteria meet?  
   - Output: Answer with a brief reasoning.
