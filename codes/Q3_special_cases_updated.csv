Case14226,"A 55-year-old patient is being evaluated by oncology for germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) testing because they have a personal history of a primary solid tumor other than basal or squamous cell skin cancer and risk assessment using Tyrer-Cuzick, BRCAPro, or Penn II calculators demonstrates a 2.5% or greater likelihood of a BRCA pathogenic variant; the patient has not undergone prior genetic testing and no pre-test genetic counseling was completed, and family history is notable for a mother with a persistent, severe hematologic or immunologic disorder, with testing being pursued with coverage through Cigna and results to be reviewed by the oncology team to inform management.",No,No,Not Answerable,"Cigna's BRCA policy defines specific medical indications (personal history of BRCA-associated cancers or meeting calculator probability thresholds). The patient has a personal history of an unspecified primary solid tumor (not documented as a BRCA-associated cancer) and a calculated BRCA probability of 2.5%, which is below Cigna's commonly applied calculator threshold for testing (policy threshold = 3%); therefore the patient does not meet a defined clinical indication.","Policy medical-necessity criteria specify particular cancers (e.g., breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate) and detailed family-history combos. The patient has a 'primary solid tumor' unspecified in type, so available clinical information is insufficient to determine whether the patient's diagnosis meets the policy's specific diagnostic criteria."
Case8621,"A 2-year-old child with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with autism is undergoing evaluation with whole exome sequencing (WES) to seek a unifying diagnosis after prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing was nondiagnostic; the test was ordered by the child’s oncologist and is planned with coverage through UHC, the family reports an uncle with a congenital anomaly as relevant family history, and the family has met with a genetic counselor multiple times with pre-test counseling completed and plans for post-test follow-up.",Yes,Yes,No,"UHC permits WES for individuals with unexplained complex neurodevelopmental disorders/autism spectrum disorder when a unifying genetic diagnosis is sought; the patient has a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with autism, meeting that clinical indication.","Policy requires either (A) one major feature (e.g., global developmental delay, multiple congenital anomalies, moderate–severe ID, or early epileptic encephalopathy) or (B) two or more listed features (e.g., autism plus another feature). The record documents autism only (and an uncle with a congenital anomaly), so the explicit medical-necessity criteria in the policy are not met."
Case8661,The patient is a 7-year-old referred by the child's neurologist for evaluation of a significant hearing or visual impairment identified in childhood and whole genome sequencing (WGS) is requested to investigate a possible genetic cause. Fragile X testing was previously performed and was nondiagnostic. There is a family history of a sibling who developed an epileptic encephalopathy before three years of age. Genetic counseling was offered but the family declined pre-test counseling; testing is being pursued with coverage through UHC and plans are in place to provide post-test genetic counseling and genetics follow-up if results are informative.,No,No,Yes,"UHC WES/WGS criteria generally require documented clinical indications such as unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability, multiple congenital anomalies, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, or a highly heterogeneous condition after appropriate prior testing. This patient has isolated significant childhood hearing/visual impairment (with a family history of epileptic encephalopathy) but does not clearly meet those specific listed indications as documented, and required prior targeted testing is not documented.","WGS criteria require (among other items) clinical history suggesting a genetic cause plus qualifying features. The patient has significant hearing/visual impairment (one listed feature) and a first-degree sibling with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (relevant family history listed as a qualifying feature), and the clinical presentation is nonspecific—therefore the medical indication in policy is met."
Case5605,"The patient is an 11-year-old being evaluated for a major congenital cardiac anomaly and was referred by an obstetrician for whole genome sequencing (WGS) to assess for an underlying genetic cause. A prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) was nondiagnostic, pre-test counseling was completed with a genetic specialist, and insurance coverage is through BCBS_FEP. Family history is notable for a maternal aunt with pancreatic cancer.",Yes,Yes,No,BCBS_FEP WES/WGS coverage criteria include patients with major congenital anomalies or suspected genetic disorder after prior testing; this 11‑year‑old has a major congenital cardiac anomaly consistent with a covered indication.,"Policy medical indications for medically necessary genomic testing limit WGS to rapid testing in critically ill infants; for standard testing, WES is the covered modality for children with unexplained congenital anomalies. The patient is an 11-year-old non-critically ill child with a congenital cardiac anomaly, which does not meet the policy's narrow medical indication for WGS."
Case19162,"The infant is a neonate presenting with complex neurologic abnormalities including dystonia, ataxia, and asymmetric weakness suggestive of neonatal hemiplegia and was referred by a medical geneticist for whole genome sequencing (WGS) to evaluate for an underlying genetic or metabolic cause. Fragile X testing was previously performed and was nondiagnostic, and there is a family history of an inborn error of metabolism in a sibling. Pre-test counseling was completed with a genetic counselor and post-test follow-up is planned, and testing will be pursued with coverage through BCBS_FEP.",Yes,Yes,No,"The patient has unexplained, complex neonatal neurologic abnormalities (dystonia, ataxia, asymmetric weakness) with suspicion for an underlying genetic/metabolic cause — an indication consistent with BCBS_FEP criteria for WGS.","Policy limits medically necessary WGS to rapid WGS for critically ill infants in NICU/PICU meeting specified criteria. The record does not state the neonate is critically ill or in NICU/PICU, so the patient does not meet the specific medical indication for WGS per the policy."
Case19321,"The patient is a 1-year-old referred by a neurologist for evaluation of a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with features concerning for autism spectrum disorder, and whole exome sequencing (WES) is being pursued to investigate a possible genetic etiology; prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing was nondiagnostic. A maternal aunt is reported to have multiple congenital anomalies, pre-test genetic counseling was completed, and plans are in place for post-test follow-up, with coverage through UHC.",Yes,Yes,No,UHC medical necessity criteria support WES for pediatric patients with complex neurodevelopmental disorder/autism features when a genetic etiology is suspected; the patient has these indications.,"UnitedHealthcare policy requires either (A) the proband to have one of: multiple congenital anomalies, moderate/severe intellectual disability by age 18, global developmental delay, or early epileptic encephalopathy; or (B) two or more listed features (which include autism plus additional features such as congenital anomaly, family members with similar features, consanguinity, etc.). The record documents features concerning for ASD but does not document a second qualifying feature in the proband (e.g., confirmed global developmental delay, congenital anomaly, hypotonia, epilepsy) or clearly similar affected first/second-degree relatives, so the specific medical-indication criteria in the policy are not met."
Case7447,"At 33 weeks' gestation, fetal imaging raises concern for an isolated severe congenital heart defect and the cardiologist has ordered whole genome sequencing (WGS) to evaluate for a possible genetic etiology and to guide postnatal management; prior fragile X testing was nondiagnostic, family history is notable for a maternal aunt with triple-negative breast cancer, there is no documentation of pre-test genetic counseling, and coverage is through BCBS_FEP.",Yes,Yes,No,BCBS_FEP considers prenatal genomic sequencing medically indicated for fetuses with major structural anomalies when a genetic etiology is suspected and results may affect management. An isolated severe congenital heart defect on fetal imaging meets the 'major structural anomaly' clinical indication.,Policy specifies medical indications for WES/WGS in postnatal children or critically ill infants and explicitly states it does not address prenatal (fetal) testing; an isolated fetal congenital heart defect at 33 weeks is a prenatal indication not covered by the policy.
Case4512,"The patient is a 21-year-old referred by the primary care physician for evaluation of a major congenital cardiac anomaly present since birth, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) is being pursued to identify a potential genetic etiology; there is a family history of a sibling who experienced a brief resolved unexplained event characterized by altered level of responsiveness with cyanosis, pallor, and irregular breathing which raised concern for a heritable predisposition, and no prior genetic testing has been performed, pre-test counseling was completed with a genetic counselor and a post-test visit is planned with testing submitted with coverage through BCBS_FEP.",Yes,Yes,No,Patient has a major congenital cardiac anomaly since birth and a sibling with a potentially heritable event—this constellation is consistent with a suspected genetic etiology and meets BCBS_FEP clinical indications for genome sequencing (suspected genetic disorder / congenital anomaly).,"Policy defines medical indications for WGS only for rapid testing in critically ill infants; otherwise WGS is considered investigational. The 21-year-old adult with a congenital cardiac anomaly does not meet the policy's defined indications for WGS (policy basis: ""Rapid ... WGS ... may be considered medically necessary ... for critically ill infants"" and ""Whole genome sequencing is considered investigational for the diagnosis of genetic disorders in all other situations"")."
Case5380,"An 8-week-old infant is referred by neurology for evaluation of high-risk brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) with recurrent witnessed seizure-like episodes, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) is requested to assess for an underlying genetic cause; prior chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing was nondiagnostic, and there is a maternal history of short stature as a growth abnormality, the family declined pre-test genetic counseling, and testing will be pursued with coverage through UHC.",Yes,Yes,No,UHC medical necessity criteria support WGS/WES for infants with unexplained recurrent seizures/BRUE to identify an underlying genetic etiology; the patient has recurrent seizure‑like events fitting that indication.,"UHC WGS coverage requires specific clinical indication(s): either epileptic encephalopathy with onset before age 3 or two or more listed features. The infant has seizure-like events/BRUE but no documented diagnosis of epileptic encephalopathy and lacks two or more of the listed features. Additionally, the policy requires that neither CMA nor WES have been performed (see Q4), which is not met."
Case8485,"An 8-year-old child with hypotonia first noted in infancy is being evaluated by the general pediatrician for persistent motor delay and evolving tone abnormalities, and whole exome sequencing (WES) has been ordered to investigate a possible genetic etiology; prior Fragile X testing was nondiagnostic, the family reports a sibling with autism spectrum disorder, pre-test genetic counseling was not performed, and testing will be submitted with coverage through Cigna.",Yes,Yes,No,"Cigna considers WES medically indicated for unexplained developmental/motor delay and evolving neurologic findings in a child; this 8-year-old has persistent motor delay, hypotonia from infancy, and evolving tone abnormalities, meeting clinical indication criteria.","Policy requires specific clinical indications (e.g., global developmental delay onset <5, moderate/severe ID after formal assessment, multiple congenital anomalies, or other defined criteria). The patient has hypotonia and motor delay but does not meet any of the policy's explicit listed indications or documented formal assessments; thus the defined medical-necessity criteria are not met."
Case14017,"An otherwise healthy 7-week-old infant is being evaluated by the general pediatrician for a high-risk brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) with recurrent witnessed seizure-like events, and whole exome sequencing (WES) has been ordered to evaluate for a possible genetic etiology. Prior karyotype testing was nondiagnostic. There is a family history of neurologic disease, specifically a maternal uncle reported to have a movement disorder with dystonia and ataxia, and pre-test genetic counseling was completed with plans for post-test follow-up. Testing is being pursued with coverage through BCBS_FEP.",Yes,Yes,No,Clinical indication meets common BCBS FEP WES indications: early infancy with recurrent seizure-like events/possible epileptic disorder and concern for an underlying genetic etiology.,"Policy limits WES as medically necessary to (a) unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorders in children when ALL criteria met or (b) rapid WES for critically ill NICU/PICU infants meeting specific criteria. Although BRUE with recurrent witnessed seizure-like events is listed as a clinical feature suggesting genetic disease, the infant is not documented as critically ill/in intensive care nor as having an unexplained congenital or neurodevelopmental disorder; therefore the specific medical-indication criteria in the policy are not met."
