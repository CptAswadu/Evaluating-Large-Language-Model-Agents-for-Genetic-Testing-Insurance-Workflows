CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

Documentation that the individual has been evaluated by a clinician with expertise in clinical genetics, including at minimum a family history and\nphenotype description, and counseled about the potential risks of genetic testing.\n2. There is potential for a change in management and clinical outcome for the individual being tested .\n3. A genetic etiology is considered the most likely explanation for the phenotype despite previous genetic testing (eg, chromosomal microarray\nanalysis and/or targeted single-gene testing), OR when previous genetic testing has failed to yield a diagnosis, and the af fected individual is\nfaced with invasive procedures or testing as the next diagnostic step (eg, muscle biopsy).\nRapid whole exome sequencing or rapid whole genome sequencing, with trio testing when possible (see Policy Guidelines), may be considered\nmedically necessary  for the evaluation of critically ill infants in neonatal or pediatric intensive care with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown\netiology when BOTH of the following criteria are met :\n1. At least one of the following criteria is met:\n1. Multiple congenital anomalies (see Policy Guidelines);\n2. An abnormal laboratory test or clinical features suggests a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype (see Policy Guidelines);\n3. An abnormal response to standard therapy for a major underlying condition.\n2. None of the following criteria apply regarding the reason for admission to intensive care:\n1. An infection with normal response to therapy;\n2. Isolated prematurity;\n3. Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia;\n4. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy;\n5. Confirmed genetic diagnosis explains illness;\n6. Isolated Transient Neonatal Tachypnea; or\n7.

The WGS was\nperformed in 'rapid run\" mode with a minimum depth of 90 Gb per genome and average depth of coverage of 40-fold.\nFor rapid WES or WGS, the individual should be critically ill and in the neonatal or pediatric intensive care units (NICU, PICU) when the test is ordered\nbut may be discharged before results are delivered.\nCopy number variation (CNV) analysis should be performed in parallel with rWGS using chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) or directly within\nrWGS if the test is validated for CNV analysis.\nExamples of specific malformations highly suggestive of a genetic etiology , include but are not limited to any of the following:\nChoanal atresia\nColoboma\nHirschsprung disease\nMeconium ileus\nExamples of an abnormal laboratory test suggesting a genetic disease or complex metabolic phenotype, include but are not limited to any of the\nfollowing:\nAbnormal newborn screen\nConjugated hyperbilirubinemia not due to total parental nutrition (TPN) cholestasis\nHyperammonemia\nLactic acidosis not due to poor perfusion\nRefractory or severe hypoglycemia\nExamples of clinical features suggesting a genetic disease include but are not limited to any of the following:\nSignificant hypotonia.\nPersistent seizures.\nInfant with high risk stratification on evaluation for a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) (see below) with any of the following features:\nRecurrent events without respiratory infection\nRecurrent witnessed seizure like events\nRequired cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\nSignificantly abnormal chemistry including but not limited to electrolytes, bicarbonate or lactic acid, venous blood gas, glucose, or other\ntests that suggest an inborn error of metabolism\nSignificantly abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), including but not limited to possible channelopathies, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies,\nmyocarditis, or structural heart diseaseFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

In a practice guideline from the American\nAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP), BRUE is defined as an event occurring in an infant younger than 1 year of age when the observer reports a sudden, brief\n(usually less than one minute), and now resolved episode of one or more of the following:\nAbsent, decreased, or irregular breathing\nAltered level of responsiveness\nCyanosis or pallor\nMarked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)\nA BRUE is diagnosed only when there is no explanation for a qualifying event after conducting an appropriate history and physical examination.\nNote: More information is available at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590\nTrio T esting\nThe recommended option for testing when possible is testing of the child and both parents (trio testing). Trio testing increases the chance of finding a\ndefinitive diagnosis and reduces false-positive findings.\nTrio testing is preferred whenever possible but should not delay testing of a critically ill individual when rapid testing is indicated. Testing of one\navailable parent should be done if both are not immediately available and one or both parents can be done later if needed.\nGenetics Nomenclature Update\nThe Human Genome V ariation Society nomenclature is used to report information on variants found in DNA  and serves as an international standard in\nDNA diagnostics. It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organisation, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Whole exome sequencing or WGS tests as a clinical service\nare available under the auspices of the CLIA. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by the CLIA  for high-complexity\ntesting. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.\n \nRATIONALE\nSummary of Evidence\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup who receive whole exome sequencing (WES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes large case\nseries and within-subject comparisons. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and\nresource utilization. Patients who have multiple congenital anomalies or a developmental disorder with a suspected genetic etiology , but whose specific\ngenetic alteration is unclear or unidentified by a standard clinical workup, may be left without a clinical diagnosis of their disorder , despite a lengthy\ndiagnostic workup. For a substantial proportion of these patients, WES may return a likely pathogenic variant. Several large and smaller series have\nreported diagnostic yields of WES ranging from 25% to 60%, depending on the individual\"s age, phenotype, and previous workup. One comparative\nstudy found a 44% increase in yield compared with standard testing strategies. Many of the studies have also reported changes in patient\nmanagement, including medication changes, discontinuation of or additional testing, ending the diagnostic odyssey , and family planning. The evidence\nis suf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children with a suspected genetic disorder other than multiple congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of\nunknown etiology following a standard workup who receive WES with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes small case series and\nprospective research studies. Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource\nutilization. There is an increasing number of reports evaluating the use of WES to identify a molecular basis for disorders other than multiple congenital\nanomalies or neurodevelopmental disorders. The diagnostic yields in these studies range from as low as 3% to 60%. Some studies have reported on\nthe use of a virtual gene panel with restricted analysis of disease-associated genes, and WES data allow reanalysis as new genes are linked to the\npatient phenotype. Overall, a limited number of patients have been studied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WES for these disorders is at\nan early stage with uncertainty about changes in patient management. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an\nimprovement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who have previously received WES who receive repeat WES, including re-analysis of previous test results, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. There is no direct evidence of clinical utility . In a meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies, re-analysis of WES data resulted in\nan 11% increase in diagnostic yield (95% confidence interval (CI), 8% to 14%) in individuals who were previously undiagnosed via WES. Three\nnonrandomized studies published after the meta-analysis had findings consistent with the meta-analysis. Conclusions were limited by heterogeneity\nacross individual studies and a lack of detailed reporting on reasons for new diagnoses, changes in management based on new diagnoses, and the\nfrequency of the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Therefore, a chain of evidence for clinical utility cannot be established.\nAdditionally , the optimal timing of re-analysis has not been established, and there are no clear guidelines on what factors should prompt the decision to\nrepeat testing. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are children who are not critically ill with multiple unexplained congenital anomalies or a neurodevelopmental disorder of unknown\netiology following a standard workup or WES who receive whole genome sequencing (WGS) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes\nnonrandomized studies and a systematic review . Relevant outcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making,\nand resource utilization. In studies of children with congenital anomalies and developmental delays of unknown etiology following standard clinical\nworkup, the yield of WGS has ranged between 20% and 40%. A majority of studies described methods for interpretation of WGS indicating that only\npathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were included in the diagnostic yield and that VUS were frequently not reported. In a systematic review , the\npooled (9 studies, N=648) diagnostic yield of WGS was 40% (95% CI, 32% to 49%). Although the diagnostic yield of WGS is at least as high as WES\nin individuals without a diagnosis following standard clinical workup, it is unclear if the additional yield results in actionable clinical management\nchanges that improve health outcomes. Further , while reporting practices of VUS found on exome and genome sequencing vary across laboratories,\nWGS results in the identification of more VUS than WES. The clinical implications of this dif ference are uncertain as more VUS findings can be seen as\npotential for future VUS reclassification allowing a diagnosis. However , most VUS do not relate to the patient phenotype, the occurrence of medical\nmismanagement and patient stress based on misinterpretation of VUS is not well defined, and provider reluctance to interpret VUS information lessen\nthe value of additional VUS identification by WGS. As such, higher yield and higher VUS from WGS currently have limited clinical utility . The evidence\nis insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.FEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

Whole genome\nsequencing has also been studied in other genetic conditions with yield ranging from 9% to 55%. Overall, a limited number of patients have been\nstudied for any specific disorder , and clinical use of WGS as well as information regarding meaningful changes in management for these disorders is at\nan early stage. The evidence is insuf ficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nFor individuals who are critically ill infants with a suspected genetic disorder of unknown etiology following a standard workup who receive rapid WGS\n(rWGS) or rapid WES (rWES) with trio testing when possible, the evidence includes randomized controlled trials (RCT s) and case series. Relevant\noutcomes are test validity , functional outcomes, changes in reproductive decision making, and resource utilization. One RCT  comparing rWGS with\nstandard genetic tests to diagnose suspected genetic disorders in critically ill infants was terminated early due to loss of equipoise. The rate of genetic\ndiagnosis within 28 days of enrollment was higher for rWGS versus standard tests (31% vs. 3%; p=.003). Changes in management due to test results\nwere reported in 41% (p=.1 1) of rWGS versus 21% of control patients; however , 73% of control subjects received broad genetic tests (eg, next-\ngeneration sequencing panel testing, WES, or WGS) as part of standard testing. A second RCT  compared rWGS to rWES in seriously ill infants with\ndiseases of unknown etiology from the neonatal intensive care unit, pediatric intensive care unit, and cardiovascular intensive care unit. The diagnostic\nyield of rWGS and rWES was similar (19% vs. 20%, respectively), as was time to result (median, 1 1 vs. 1 1 days). The NICUSeq RCT  compared rWGS\n(test results returned in 15 days) to a delayed reporting group (WGS with test results returned in 60 days) in 354 infants admitted to an intensive care\nunit with a suspected genetic disease. Diagnostic yield was higher in the rWGS group (31.0%; 95% CI, 25.5% to 38.7% vs. 15.0%; 95% CI, 10.2% to\n21.3%). Additionally , significantly more infants in the rWGS group had a change in management compared with the delayed arm (21.1% vs. 10.3%;\np=.009; odds ratio, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.22 to 4.32). Several retrospective and prospective studies including more than 800 critically ill infants and children in\ntotal have reported on diagnostic yield for rWGS or rWES. These studies included phenotypically diverse but critically ill infants and had yields of\nbetween 30% and 60% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Studies have also reported associated changes in patient management for patients\nreceiving a diagnosis from rWGS or rWES, including avoidance of invasive procedures, medication changes to reduce morbidity , discontinuation of or\nadditional testing, and initiation of palliative care or reproductive planning. A chain of evidence linking meaningful improvements in diagnostic yield and\nchanges in management expected to improve health outcomes supports the clinical value of rWGS or rWES. The evidence is suf ficient to determine\nthat the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information\" if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Guidelines on Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy\n \nRecommendation LOE\nDiagnosis  \nFor patients with suspected muscular dystrophy , clinicians should use a clinical approach to guide\ngenetic diagnosis based on the clinical phenotype, including the pattern of muscle involvement,\ninheritance pattern, age at onset, and associated manifestations (eg, early contractures, cardiac or\nrespiratory involvement).B\nIn patients with suspected muscular dystrophy in whom initial clinically directed genetic testing does not\nprovide a diagnosis, clinicians may obtain genetic consultation or perform parallel sequencing of\ntargeted exomes, whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome screening, or next-generation sequencing to\nidentify the genetic abnormality .C\nManagement of cardiac complications  \nClinicians should refer newly diagnosed patients with (1) limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD)1A,\nLGMD1B, LGMD1D, LGMD1E, LGMD2C - K, LGMD2M - P , ... or (2) muscular dystrophy without a\nspecific genetic diagnosis for cardiology evaluation, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and structural\nevaluation (echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), even if they are\nasymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint, to guide appropriate management.B\nIf ECG or structural cardiac evaluation (eg, echocardiography) has abnormal results, or if the patient has\nepisodes of syncope, near-syncope, or palpitations, clinicians should order rhythm evaluation (eg, Holter\nmonitor or event monitor) to guide appropriate management.B\nClinicians should refer muscular dystrophy patients with palpitations, symptomatic or asymptomatic\ntachycardia or arrhythmias, or signs and symptoms of cardiac failure for cardiology evaluation.B\nIt is not obligatory for clinicians to refer patients with LGMD2A, LGMD2B, and LGMD2L  for cardiac\nevaluation unless they develop overt cardiac signs or symptoms.B\nManagement of pulmonary complications  \nClinicians should order pulmonary function testing (spirometry and maximal inspiratory/expiratory force\nin the upright and, if normal, supine positions) or refer for pulmonary evaluation (to identify and treat\nrespiratory insuf ficiency) in muscular dystrophy patients at the time of diagnosis, or if they develop\npulmonary symptoms later in their course.BFEP 2.04.102 Whole Exome and Whole Genome Sequencing for Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

CMA  testing increases the diagnostic yield over\nkaryotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA  testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation\nsequencing panel testing allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal CMA  testing, next-generation\ntesting has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.\n \nOBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this evidence review is to evaluate whether chromosomal microarray testing or gene panel testing with next-generation sequencing\nimproves the net health outcome in individuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability , autism spectrum disorder , and/or congenital anomalies\nnot specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

It is being implemented for genetic testing medical evidence review updates starting in 2017 (see Table PG1). The Society's\nnomenclature is recommended by the Human V ariome Project, the Human Genome Organization, and by the Human Genome V ariation Society itself.\nThe American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology standards and guidelines for interpretation of\nsequence variants represent expert opinion from both organizations, in addition to the College of American Pathologists. These recommendations\nprimarily apply to genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. Table PG2 shows the\nrecommended standard terminology - \"pathogenic,” \"likely pathogenic,” \"uncertain significance,” \"likely benign,” and \"benign” - to describe variants\nidentified that cause Mendelian disorders.\n \n \n \n \n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice.

The interpretation of the results of genetic tests and the understanding of risk\nfactors can be very dif ficult and complex. Therefore, genetic counseling will assist individuals in understanding the possible benefits and harms of\ngenetic testing, including the possible impact of the information on the individual's family . Genetic counseling may alter the utilization of genetic testing\nsubstantially and may reduce inappropriate testing. Genetic counseling should be performed by an individual with experience and expertise in genetic\nmedicine and genetic testing methods.\n \n \nBENEFIT APPLICA TION\nExperimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs, or devices are not covered (See General Exclusion Section of brochure).\nScreening (other than the preventive services listed in the brochure) is not covered.

Lab tests for CMA  testing and next-generation sequencing are\navailable under the auspices of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. Laboratories that of fer laboratory-developed tests must be licensed by\nthe Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  has chosen not to\nrequire any regulatory review of this test.\nIn 2010, the FDA  indicated that it would require microarray manufacturers to seek clearance to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.\nCMA  Testing\nCMA  testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes targeted and whole-genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray\nanalysis.\nIn January 2014, the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay (now Thermo Fisher Scientific) was cleared by the FDA  through the de novo 510(k) process. The\nFDA\"s review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic evaluation of the test\"s ability to detect accurately numerous chromosomal variations of\ndifferent types, sizes, and genome locations compared with several analytically validated test methods. The FDA  found that the CytoScan Dx Assay\ncould detect CNVs across the genome and adequately detect CNVs in regions of the genome associated with developmental delay/intellectual\ndisability . Reproducibility decreased with the CNV gain or loss size, particularly when less than approximately 400 kilobases (generally recommended\nas the lower reporting limit).

Relevant outcomes\nare test validity , changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The available evidence supports test validity .\nAlthough systematic studies of the impact of CMA  on patient outcomes are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been\nwell-demonstrated. Direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA  compared with karyotyping is also lacking. However , for at least a subset of the\ndisorders potentially diagnosed with CMA  testing in this patient population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with\npositive test results. Further , there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision-making as a result of positive test results. The information derived\nfrom CMA  testing can accomplish the following: it could end a long diagnostic odyssey , reduce morbidity for certain conditions by initiating\nsurveillance/management of associated comorbidities, or it could impact future reproductive decision making for parents. The evidence is suf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\n \n FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nFor individuals who have developmental delay/intellectual disability , ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic\nsyndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test validity ,\nchanges in reproductive decision-making, morbid events, and resource utilization. The diagnostic yield associated with next-generation sequencing\npanel testing in this patient population is not well-characterized. The testing yield and likelihood of an uncertain result are variable, based on the gene\npanel, gene tested, and patient population; additionally , there are risks of uninterpretable and incidental results. The evidence is insuf ficient to\ndetermine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.\nSUPPLEMENT AL INFORMA TION\nPractice Guidelines and Position Statements\nGuidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by , or jointly by , a US professional\nsociety , an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines\nthat are informed by a systematic review , include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child with developmental\ndelays or intellectual disability .15, Regarding chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing, this report stated: \"CMA  now should be considered a first-tier\ndiagnostic test in all children with [global developmental delay/intellectual disability] GDD/ID for whom the causal diagnosis is not known.... CMA  is now\nthe standard for diagnosis of patients with GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital anomalies.”\nIn 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with developmental disorders through surveillance and screening.110,\nThe report proposed a screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that: \"A  child with suspected global\ndevelopmental delay or intellectual disability should have laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing [...] Further\ntesting may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation including whole exome sequencing and gene panels.\"\nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on the assessment and treatment of children and\nadolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).111, The Academy recommended that \"all children with ASD should have a medical assessment,\nwhich typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a W ood's lamp examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which\nmay include G-banded karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray .”\nAmerican Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society\nIn 201 1, the American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society updated their guidelines on the evaluation of unexplained\ndevelopmental delay and intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic (biochemical) testing to accommodate advances in the\nfield.112, The guidelines concluded that CMA  testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with developmental delay/intellectual disability , that the\n\"often complex results require confirmation and careful interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist,” and that CMA  should be\nconsidered the \"first-line” test. The guidelines acknowledged that \"Research is sorely lacking on the medical, social, and financial benefits of having an\naccurate etiologic diagnosis.”\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics\nThe American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaf firmed 2020) published a clinical practice resource on array-based technologies and\ntheir clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal abnormalities.113,114, CMA  testing for copy number variants was recommended as a first-line test in\nthe initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the following:\nMultiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome\nApparently nonsyndromic developmental delay/intellectual disability\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)FEP 2.04.59 Genetic Testing for Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability , Autism Spectrum Disorder , and Congenital Anomalies\nThe policies contained in the FEP  Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not\nintended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member . The\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP  Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy , to recommend, advocate, encourage or\ndiscourage any particular medical technologies.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that the Blue Cross and\nBlue Shield Service Benefit Plan covers (or pays for) this service or supply for a particular member .\n\nOther ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software8,115, and for the\ninterpretation and reporting of copy number variants,11, both intended for the postnatal setting.\nA 2013 update included recommendations on the validation of microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.116, The guideline\nrevisions from ACMG (2013) stated that a stepwise or tiered approach to the clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of ASD is recommended, with the\nfirst tier including fragile X syndrome and CMA, and the second tier MECP2  and PTEN  testing.117, The guidelines stated that: \"this approach will evolve\nwith continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been\nreported in association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these has been evaluated in a large prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of\nevaluation is a distinct possibility . Further studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. Alternatively ,\nadvances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform. The\naccumulating evidence using next-generation sequencing (third-tier testing) will increase the diagnostic yield even more over the next few years.”\nU.S. Preventive Services T ask Force Recommendations\nNot applicable.\nMedicare National Coverage\nThere is no national coverage determination. In the absence of a national coverage determination, coverage decisions are left to the discretion of local\nMedicare carriers.\nREFERENCES\n1. Mikhail FM, Lose EJ, Robin NH, et al.

The WGS  was performed  in \n‘rapid  run’ mode  with  a minimum  depth  of 90 Gb per genome  and average  depth  of coverage  of 40-fold.  \nFor rapid  WES  or WGS,  the individual  should  be critically  ill and in the neonatal  or pediatric  intensive  \ncare  units  (NICU,  PICU)  when  the test is ordered  but may  be discharged  before  results  are delivered.  \nCopy  number  variation  (CNV)  analysis  should  be performed  in parallel  with  rWGS  using  chromosomal  \nmicroarray  analysis  (CMA)  or directly  within  rWGS  if the test is validated  for CNV  analysis.  \nExamples  of specific  malformations  highly  suggestive  of a genetic  etiology,  include  but are not limited  to \nany of the following:  \n• Choanal  atresia  \n• Coloboma  \n• Hirschsprung  disease  \n• Meconium  ileus  \nExamples  of an abnormal  laboratory  test suggesting  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype,  \ninclude  but are not limited  to any of the following:  \n• Abnormal  newborn  screen  \n• Conjugated  hyperbilirubinemia  not due to total  parental  nutrition  (TPN)  cholestasis  \n• Hyperammonemia  \n• Lactic  acidosis  not due to poor  perfusion  \n• Refractory  or severe  hypoglycemia  \nExamples  of clinical  features  suggesting  a genetic  disease  include  but are not limited  to any of the \nfollowing:  \n• Significant  hypotonia.  \n• Persistent  seizures.  \n• Infant  with  high  risk stratification  on evaluation  for a Brief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  (BRUE)  \n(see  below)  with  any of the following  features:  \no Recurrent  events  without  respiratory  infection  \no Recurrent  witnessed  seizure  like events  \no Required  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  \no Significantly  abnormal  chemistry  including  but not limited  to electrolytes,  bicarbonate  \nor lactic  acid,  venous  blood  gas, glucose,  or other  tests  that suggest  an inborn  error  of \nmetabolism  \n• Significantly  abnormal  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  including  but not limited  to possible  \nchannelopathies,  arrhythmias,  cardiomyopathies,  myocarditis,  or structural  heart  disease  \n• Family  history  of: \no Arrhythmia  \no BRUE  in sibling  \no Developmental  delay  \no Inborn  error  of metabolism  or genetic  disease  \no Long  QT syndrome  (LQTS)  \no Sudden  unexplained  death  (including  unexplained  car accident  or drowning)  in first- or \nsecond -degree  family  members  before  age 35, and particularly  as an infant  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   4 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  \nBrief  Resolved  Unexplained  Event  was previously  known  as Apparent  Life Threatening  Event  (ALTE).  In a \npractice  guideline  from  the American  Academy  of Pediatrics  (AAP),  BRUE  is defined  as an event  \noccurring  in an infant  younger  than  1 year  of age when  the observer  reports  a sudden,  brief  (usually  less \nthan  one minute),  and now  resolved  episode  of one or more  of the following:  \n• Absent,  decreased,  or irregular  breathing  \n• Altered  level  of responsiveness  \n• Cyanosis  or pallor  \n• Marked  change  in tone  (hyper - or hypotonia)  \nA BRUE  is diagnosed  only  when  there  is no explanation  for a qualifying  event  after  conducting  an \nappropriate  history  and physical  examination.  \nNote:  More  information  is available  at: https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/137/5/e20160590   \nTrio Testing  \nThe recommended  option  for testing  when  possible  is testing  of the child  and both  parents  (trio  testing).  \nTrio testing  increases  the chance  of finding  a definitive  diagnosis  and reduces  false -positive  findings.  \nTrio testing  is preferred  whenever  possible  but should  not delay  testing  of a critically  ill individual  when  \nrapid  testing  is indicated.  Testing  of one available  parent  should  be done  if both  are not immediately  \navailable  and one or both  parents  can be done  later  if needed.  \nGenetics  Nomenclature  Update  \nThe Human  Genome  Variation  Society  nomenclature  is used  to report  information  on variants  found  in \nDNA  and serves  as an international  standard  in DNA  diagnostics.  It is being  implemented  for genetic  \ntesting  medical  evidence  review  updates  starting  in 2017  (see Table  PG1).  The Society's  nomenclature  is \nrecommended  by the Human  Variome  Project,  the Human  Genome  Organisation,  and by the Human  \nGenome  Variation  Society  itself.  \nThe American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  and the Association  for Molecular  Pathology  \nstandards  and guidelines  for interpretation  of sequence  variants  represent  expert  opinion  from  both  \norganizations,  in addition  to the College  of American  Pathologists.  These  recommendations  primarily  \napply  to genetic  tests  used  in clinical  laboratories,  including  genotyping,  single  genes,  panels,  exomes,  \nand genomes.  Table  PG2 shows  the recommended  standard  terminology -\"pathogenic,\"  \"likely  \npathogenic,\"  \"uncertain  significance,\"  \"likely  benign,\"  and \"benign\" -to describe  variants  identified  that \ncause  Mendelian  disorders.  \nTable  PG1.

The interpretation  of the results  of genetic  tests  and the understanding  of risk factors  can \nbe very  difficult  and complex.  Therefore,  genetic  counseling  will assist  individuals  in understanding  the \npossible  benefits  and harms  of genetic  testing,  including  the possible  impact  of the information  on the \nindividual's  family.  Genetic  counseling  may  alter  the utilization  of genetic  testing  substantially  and may  \nreduce  inappropriate  testing.  Genetic  counseling  should  be performed  by an individual  with  experience  \nand expertise  in genetic  medicine  and genetic  testing  methods.  \nCoding  \nSee the Codes  table  for details.  \nBENEFIT  APPLICATION  \nBlue  Card/National  Account  Issues  \nSome  Plans  may  have  contract  or benefit  exclusions  for genetic  testing.  \nBenefit  Exceptions  \nThis policy  may  not apply  to all lines  of business  such  as the Federal  Employee  Program,  Medicare  \nSupplement,  Medicare  Advantage,  Medicaid,  and certain  self-insured  groups.  \nBACKGROUND  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  (WES)  is targeted  next -generation  sequencing  (NGS)  of the subset  of the \nhuman  genome  that contains  functionally  important  sequences  of protein -coding  DNA,  while  whole  \ngenome  sequencing  (WGS)  uses  NGS  techniques  to sequence  both  coding  and noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  Whole  exome  sequencing  and WGS  have  been  proposed  for use in patients  presenting  with  \ndisorders  and anomalies  not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  Potential  candidates  for WES  and \nWGS  include  patients  who  present  with  a broad  spectrum  of suspected  genetic  conditions.  \nGiven  the variety  of disorders  and management  approaches,  there  are a variety  of potential  health  \noutcomes  from  a definitive  diagnosis.  In general,  the outcomes  of a molecular  genetic  diagnosis  include  \n(1) impacting  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) informing  follow -up that can benefit  a child  by reducing  \nmorbidity,  and (3) affecting  reproductive  planning  for parents  and potentially  the affected  patient.  \nThe standard  diagnostic  workup  for patients  with  suspected  Mendelian  disorders  may  include  \ncombinations  of radiographic,  electrophysiologic,  biochemical,  biopsy,  and targeted  genetic  \nevaluations.1, The search  for a diagnosis  may  thus  become  a time -consuming  and expensive  process.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  Technology  \nWhole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  using  NGS  technology  can facilitate  obtaining  a genetic  diagnosis  in \npatients  efficiently.  Whole  exome  sequencing  is limited  to most  of the protein -coding  sequence  of an \nindividual  (»85%),  is composed  of about  20,000  genes  and 180,000  exons  (protein -coding  segments  of a \ngene),  and constitutes  approximately  1% of the genome.  It is believed  that the exome  contains  about  \n85%  of heritable  disease -causing  variants.  Whole  exome  sequencing  has the advantage  of speed  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   6 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nefficiency  relative  to Sanger  sequencing  of multiple  genes.  Whole  exome  sequencing  shares  some  \nlimitations  with  Sanger  sequencing.  For example,  it will not identify  the following:  intronic  sequences  or \ngene  regulatory  regions;  chromosomal  changes;  large  deletions;  duplications;  or rearrangements  within  \ngenes,  nucleotide  repeats,  or epigenetic  changes.  Whole  genome  sequencing  uses  techniques  similar  to \nWES  but includes  noncoding  regions.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has a greater  ability  to detect  large  \ndeletions  or duplications  in protein -coding  regions  compared  with  WES  but requires  greater  data  \nanalytics.  \nTechnical  aspects  of WES  and WGS  are evolving,  including  the development  of databases  such  as the \nNational  Institutes  of Health’s  ClinVar  database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ ) to catalog  \nvariants,  uneven  sequencing  coverage,  gaps  in exon  capture  before  sequencing,  and difficulties  with  \nnarrowing  the large  initial  number  of variants  to manageable  numbers  without  losing  likely  candidate  \ndisease -associated  variants.  The variability  contributed  by the different  platforms  and procedures  used  \nby different  clinical  laboratories  offering  exome  sequencing  as a clinical  service  is unknown.  \nIn 2013,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics,  Association  for Molecular  Pathology,  \nand College  of American  Pathologists  convened  a workgroup  to standardize  terminology  for describing  \nsequence  variants.  In 2015,  guidelines  developed  by this workgroup  describe  criteria  for classifying  \npathogenic  and benign  sequence  variants  based  on 5 categories  of data:  pathogenic,  likely  pathogenic,  \nuncertain  significance,  likely  benign,  and benign.2, \nRegulatory  Status  \nClinical  laboratories  may  develop  and validate  tests  in-house  and market  them  as a laboratory  service;  \nlaboratory -developed  tests  must  meet  the general  regulatory  standards  of the Clinical  Laboratory  \nImprovement  Amendments  (CLIA).  Whole  exome  sequencing  or WGS  tests  as a clinical  service  are \navailable  under  the auspices  of the CLIA.  Laboratories  that offer  laboratory -developed  tests  must  be \nlicensed  by the CLIA  for high -complexity  testing.  To date,  the U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  \nhas chosen  not to require  any regulatory  review  of this test.  \nRATIONALE  \nThis evidence  review  was created  in September  2013  with  searches  of the PubMed  database.  The most  \nrecent  literature  update  was performed  through  January 6, 2025 . \nEvidence  reviews  assess  whether  a medical  test is clinically  useful.  A useful  test provides  information  to \nmake  a clinical  management  decision  that improves  the net health  outcome.  That  is, the balance  of \nbenefits  and harms  is better  when  the test is used  to manage  the condition  than  when  another  test or \nno test is used  to manage  the condition.  \nThe first step  in assessing  a medical  test is to formulate  the clinical  context  and purpose  of the test.  The \ntest must  be technically  reliable,  clinically  valid,  and clinically  useful  for that purpose.  Evidence  reviews  \nassess  the evidence  on whether  a test is clinically  valid  and clinically  useful.  Technical  reliability  is \noutside  the scope  of these  reviews,  and credible  information  on technical  reliability  is available  from  \nother  sources.  \nThis review  was informed  in part by a TEC Special  Report  (2013)  on exome  sequencing  for patients  with  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders.3, \nIn 2018,  Smith  et al reported  a scoping  review  of genome  and exome  sequencing  as a diagnostic  tool for \npediatric  patients.  4, The authors  identified  171 publications,  although  131 were  case  reports.  They  \nconcluded  that diagnostic  yield  was the only  consistently  reported  outcome.  The median  diagnostic  \nyield  in publications  including  more  than  single  case  reports  was 33%  but varied  by broad  clinical  \ncategories  and test type.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   7 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe following  sections  review  evidence  by test type  (whole  exome  sequencing  [WES]  and whole  genome  \nsequencing  [WGS]),  broad  type  of disorder,  and care  setting  (intensive  care  vs. not intensive  care).  \nPromotion  of greater  diversity  and inclusion  in clinical  research  of historically  marginalized  groups  (e.g.,  \nPeople  of Color  [African -American,  Asian,  Black,  Latino  and Native  American];  LGBTQIA  (Lesbian,  Gay,  \nBisexual,  Transgender,  Queer,  Intersex,  Asexual);  Women;  and People  with  Disabilities  [Physical  and \nInvisible])  allows  policy  populations  to be more  reflective  of and findings  more  applicable  to our diverse  \nmembers.  While  we also strive  to use inclusive  language  related  to these  groups  in our policies,  use of \ngender -specific  nouns  (e.g.,  women,  men,  sisters,  etc.)  will continue  when  reflective  of language  used  in \npublications  describing  study  populations.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  \nDisorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WES  in children  who  have  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  workup  is to establish  a \nmolecular  diagnosis.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  \nbe considered  clinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that are suspected  to have  a genetic  basis,  but are not \nexplained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or \na neurodevelopmental  disorder:  standard  clinical  workup  without  WES.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   8 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nA number  of studies  have  reported  on the use of WES  in clinical  practice  (Table  1). Typically,  the \npopulations  included  in these  studies  have  had suspected  rare genetic  disorders,  although  the specific  \npopulations  vary.  \nSeries  have  been  reported  with  as many  as 2000  patients.  The most  common  reason  for referral  to a \ntertiary  care  center  was an unexplained  neurodevelopmental  disorder.  Many  patients  had been  through  \na standard  clinical  workup  and testing  without  identification  of a genetic  variant  to explain  their  \ncondition.  Diagnostic  yield  in these  studies,  defined  as the proportion  of tested  patients  with  clinically  \nrelevant  genomic  anomalies,  ranged  from  25%  to 48%.  Because  there  is no reference  standard  for the \ndiagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  strategies,  clinical  confirmation  may  be the \nonly  method  for determining  false -positive  and false -negative  rates.  No reports  were  identified  of \nincorrect  diagnoses,  and how  often  they  might  occur  is unclear.  \nWhen  used  as a first-line test in infants  with  multiple  congenital  anomalies  and dysmorphic  features,  \ndiagnostic  yield  may  be as high  as 58%.  Testing  parent -child  trios  has been  reported  to increase  \ndiagnostic  yield,  to identify  an inherited  variant  from  an unaffected  parent  and be considered  benign,  or \nto identify  a de novo  variant  not present  in an unaffected  parent.  First -line trio testing  for children  with  \ncomplex  neurologic  disorders  was shown  to increase  the diagnostic  yield  (29%,  plus a possible  diagnostic  \nfinding  in 27%)  compared  with  a standard  clinical  pathway  (7%)  performed  in parallel  in the same  \npatients.5, \nTable  1.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs).  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WES  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nCohort  studies  following  children  from  presentation  to outcomes  have  not been  reported.  There  are \nconsiderable  challenges  conducting  studies  of sufficient  size given  underlying  genetic  heterogeneity,  and \nincluding  follow -up adequate  to observe  final  health  outcomes.  Studies  addressing  clinical  utility  have  \nreported  mainly  diagnostic  yield  and management  changes.  Thus,  it is difficult  to quantify  lower  or \nupper  bounds  for any potential  improvement  in the net health  outcome  owing  in part to the \nheterogeneity  of disorders,  rarity,  and outcome  importance  that may  differ  according  to identified  \npathogenic  variants.  Actionable  items  following  testing  in the reviewed  studies  (Table  1) included  family  \nplanning,  change  in management,  change  or avoidance  of additional  testing,  surveillance  for associated  \nmorbidities,  prognosis,  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nThe evidence  reviewed  here  reflects  the accompanying  uncertainty,  but supports  a perspective  that \nidentifying  a pathogenic  variant  can (1) impact  the search  for a diagnosis,  (2) inform  follow -up that can \nbenefit  a child  by reducing  morbidity  and rarely  potential  mortality,  and (3) affect  reproductive  planning  \nfor parents  and later,  potentially  the affected  child.  When  recurrence  risk can be estimated  for an \nidentified  variant  (e.g., by including  parent  testing),  future  reproductive  decisions  can be affected.

Comparative  studies  have  reported  an increase  in \ndiagnostic  yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Thus,  for individuals  who  have  a suspected  \ngenetic  etiology  but for whom  the specific  genetic  alteration  is unclear  or unidentified  by a standard  \nclinical  workup,  WES  may  return  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  A genetic  diagnosis  for these  patients  is \nreported  to change  management,  including  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  \nending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  \nWhole  Exome  Sequencing  for Children  with  a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  other  than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  \nWorkup;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nMost  of the literature  on WES  is on neurodevelopmental  disorders  in children;  however,  other  potential  \nindications  for WES  have  been  reported  (Table  2). These  include  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy,  \ninherited  retinal  disease,  and other  disorders  including  mitochondrial,  endocrine,  and immunologic  \ndisorders.  \nThe purpose  of WES  in patients  who  have  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or \nheritable  disorder  may  be considered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  presenting  with  a disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  that is suspected  to have  a genetic  \nbasis  but is not explained  by a standard  clinical  workup.  \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is WES.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  \nmultiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder:  a standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  \nvaries  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  \ndysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and \nimaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  \nfor that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   13 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies,  therefore  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nStudies  have  assessed  WES  for a broad  spectrum  of disorders.  The diagnostic  yield  in patient  \npopulations  restricted  to specific  phenotypes  ranges  from  3% for colorectal  cancer  to 60%  for \nunexplained  limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  (Table  2). Some  studies  used  a virtual  gene  panel  that is \nrestricted  to genes  associated  with  the phenotype,  while  others  have  examined  the whole  exome,  either  \ninitially  or sequentially.  An advantage  of WES  over  individual  gene  or gene  panel  testing  is that the \nstored  data  allows  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  Whole  exome  \nsequencing  has also been  reported  to be beneficial  in patients  with  atypical  presentations.  \nTable  2.

Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WES  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nA genetic  diagnosis  for an unexplained  disorder  can alter  management  in several  ways:  such  a diagnosis  \nmay  lead  to genetic  counseling  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and may  affect  reproductive  decision  \nmaking.  \nBecause  the clinical  validity  of WES  for this indication  has not been  established,  a chain  of evidence  \ncannot  be constructed.  \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder  \nThere  is an increasing  number  of reports  assessing  use of WES  to identify  a molecular  basis  for disorders  \nother  than  multiple  congenital  anomalies  or neurodevelopmental  disorders.  The diagnostic  yields  in \nthese  studies  ranged  from  3% for colorectal  cancer  to 60%  for trio (parents  and child)  analysis  of limb -\ngirdle  muscular  dystrophy.  Some  studies  have  reported  on the use of a virtual  gene  panel  with  restricted  \nanalysis  of disease -associated  genes,  and the authors  noted  that WES  data  allow  reanalysis  as new  \ngenes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for \nany specific  disorder,  and study  of WES  in these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  \nchanges  in patient  management.  \nRepeat  Whole  Exome  Sequencing  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test,  in individuals  who  have  \npreviously  received  WES  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis.  \nThe criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be considered  \nclinically  useful  are as follows:  \n• A definitive  diagnosis  cannot  be made  based  on history,  physical  examination,  pedigree  analysis,  \nand/or  standard  diagnostic  studies  or tests;  \n• The clinical  utility  of a diagnosis  has been  established  (e.g., by demonstrating  that a definitive  \ndiagnosis  will lead  to changes  in clinical  management  of the condition,  changes  in surveillance,  \nor changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and these  changes  will lead  to improved  health  \noutcomes);  and \n• Establishing  the diagnosis  by genetic  testing  will end the clinical  workup  for other  disorders.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   18 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nIntervention  \nThe relevant  intervention  of interest  is repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of data  from  a previous  test.  \nRepeat  WES  is intended  to be used  after  a WES  test has been  performed  without  establishing  a \ndiagnosis.  Repeat  testing  could  lead  to a diagnosis  in a previously  undiagnosed  individual  as new  \npathogenic  genes  or variants  are identified  or new  diagnostic  technologies  are developed.  Additionally,  \ntesting  strategies  might  be revised  based  on the emergence  of new  clinical  features  as a child  develops  \nor the identification  of congenital  anomalies  or developmental  disorders  in additional  family  members.  \nComparators  \nThe comparators  of interest  for this indication  are no further  molecular  testing  following  an initial  WES  \ntest,  and WGS  following  an initial  WES  test.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of individuals  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  individual.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of repeat  WES,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  of repeat  WES;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  children  with  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders  were  included;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nSystematic  Review  \nDai et al (2022)  conducted  a systematic  review  to determine  the diagnostic  yield  of sequencing  \nreanalysis  of data  from  cases  with  no diagnosis  following  an initial  WES  or WGS  test (Table  5).33,The \nprimary  measure  of efficacy  was the proportion  of undiagnosed  individuals  reaching  a positive  diagnosis  \non reanalysis  after  first round  sequencing  and analysis.  Results  are summarized  in Table  6. The overall  \ndiagnostic  yield  was 0.10  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI], 0.06  to 0.13).  Using  the GRADE  framework,  the \ncertainty  of the evidence  for this outcome  was rated  moderate  certainty.  Confidence  in the estimate  \nwas downgraded  due to significant  heterogeneity  across  studies  that could  not be explained  by \nsubgroup  analyses.  The researchers  performed  subgroup  analyses  on the basis  of time  interval  between  \nthe original  analysis  and reanalysis  (<24  months  compared  with  ≥24 months),  sequencing  methodology  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   19 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n(WES  vs. WGS),  study  sample  size (<50,  50 to 100,  >100  patients),  sequencing  of family  members  for \nsegregation  analysis,  whether  research  validation  of novel  variants/genes  were  conducted,  and whether  \nany artificial  intelligence -based  tools  were  used  in variant  curation.

In 62%  of these  cases  the reason  was a new  gene  discovery,  in 15%  the reasons  were  \nunknown  or unspecified,  and in 11%  the reason  was validation  of candidate  variants  through  research  or \nexternal  collaboration.  Other  reasons  included  bioinformatic  pipeline  improvements  (3.3%),  laboratory  \nerrors/misinterpretations  (2.8%),  updated  clinical  phenotypes  (2.1%),  copy  number  variants  (1.9%),  and \nadditional  segregation  studies  in relatives  (1.2%).  \nOnly  7 of 29 studies  provided  individual  clinical  information  of sequenced  probands  (e.g.,  diagnosed  \nvariant,  or timing  of reanalysis)  but instead  reported  summary  data  of the overall  population.  There  \nwere  11 studies  that reported  the finding  of variants  of uncertain  significance  (VUS)  and/or  variants  in \nnovel  genes  but only  8 studies  provided  research  evidence  confirming  their  pathogenicity.  Only  3 studies  \ndiscussed  whether  a genetic  diagnosis  led to management  changes,  and the impact  on management  was \nonly  described  in a subgroup  of individuals.  To address  uncertainties  in the evidence,  the review  authors  \nrecommended  best  practices  for future  research  including  detailed  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria,  \ndetailed  clinical  information  on each  case,  clear  documentation  of methodology  used  for initial  and re-\nanalysis,  and reporting  of the rationale  for attribution  of pathogenicity.  \nNonrandomized  Studies  \nTable  7 summarizes  nonrandomized  studies  published  after  the Dai et al (2022)  systematic  review.

However,  \nthe evidence  is insufficient  to establish  the clinical  utility  of repeat  testing.  Individual  studies  lacked  \ndetail  on the reasons  for new  diagnoses,  changes  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the \nfrequency  of the identification  of VUS.  Additionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  \nestablished,  and there  are no clear  guidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  \ntesting.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup  or Whole  Exome  \nSequencing;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  is to establish  a \nmolecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the genome.

Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  as a \nclinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practices  are currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  A standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS,  and WES  with  trio testing  when  possible.  \nA standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  condition  varies  by patient  \nphenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  (including  dysmorphology  and \nneurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  testing,  and imaging.  If the results  \nsuggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  methods  relevant  for that syndrome  \nwould  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  Compared  to Standard  Clinical  Workup  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   24 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  workup  \nin several  observational  studies,  both  prospective  and retrospective.

Ten studies (ES=9; GS=1), \ncomprising 1905 probands, compared diagnostic rate among pediatric vs adult patients within cohorts, \nfinding pediatric patients had 1.6 -times odds of a diagnosis compared to that of adult patients (95% CI \n1.22 -2.10, I 2 = 0%, P <.01).  \nAcross all age groups, diagnostic rates of whole exome sequencing (0.38; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.40) and \nwhole genome sequencing (0.34; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.38) were similar (p=.1). Within -cohort comparison \nfrom 9 studies (2269 probands) showed 1.2 -times odds of diagnosis by whole genome sequencing over \nwhole exome sequencing (95% CI: 0.79 to 1.83; p=.38).Whole genome sequencing studies identified a \nhigher range of novel genes (GS: 2 -579 novel genes based on 6 studies, 5538 probands vs. ES: 1 -75 novel \ngenes based on 22 studies, 5038 probands). Variants of unknown significance (VUS) had wide ranges for \nboth ES and GS (ES: <1 -59%; GS: 6 -50%; p=.78), with severe heterogeneity in methodology and \nreporting. Overall, VUS showed a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2021.  \nThe quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies tool was used to assess bias in the included \nstudies. Studies with a low bias ranking in all domains were deemed high -quality and were used in a \nseparate analysis. Among the 22 high -quality studies (4,580 probands), the clinical utility of whole \ngenome sequencing (0.77; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.90) was higher than that of whole exome sequencing (0.44; \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   28 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n95% CI: 0.30 to 0.58) (p<.01). It is unclear if any study compared whole exome sequencing with \nassessment of structural variants versus whole genome sequencing.  \nA 2020  Health  Technology  Assessment  conducted  by Ontario  Health,  with  literature  searches  conducted  \nin January  2019,  included  a comparative  review  of the diagnostic  yield  of WES  and WGS  in children  with  \nunexplained  developmental  disabilities  or multiple  congenital  anomalies.45, The diagnostic  yield  across  \nall studies  was 37%  (95%  CI, 34%  to 40%).  More  studies,  with  an overall  larger  sample  size,  were  \nincluded  in the examination  on WES  (34 studies,  N=9142)  than  on WGS  (9 studies,  N=648).  Confidence  \nintervals  for studies  using  WES  versus  WGS  overlapped  (37%;  95%  CI, 34%  to 40%,  vs. 40%;  95%  CI, 32%  \nto 49%).  Diagnostic  yield  ranged  between  16%  and 73%,  with  variation  attributed  largely  to technology  \nused  and participant  selection.  The overall  quality  of the evidence  was rated  as very  low,  downgraded  \nfor risk of bias,  inconsistency,  indirectness,  and imprecision.  \nIn some  studies  of WGS,  the genes  examined  were  those  previously  associated  with  the phenotype,  \nwhile  other  studies  were  research -based  and conducted  more  exploratory  analysis.  It has been  noted  \nthat genomes  sequenced  with  WGS  are available  for future  review  when  new  variants  associated  with  \nclinical  diseases  are discovered.37, \nStudies  have  shown  that WGS  can detect  more  pathogenic  variants  than  WES,  due to an improvement  in \ndetecting  copy  number  variants,  insertions  and deletions,  intronic  single -nucleotide  variants,  and exonic  \nsingle -nucleotide  variants  in regions  with  poor  coverage  on WES.  A majority  of studies  have  described  \nmethods  for interpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  \nincluded  in the diagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  not reported.  Five studies  included  in the Ontario  \nHealth  Technology  Assessment  review  provided  data  on the yield  of VUS,  with  an overall  yield  of 17%.  \nOnly  1 of the 5 studies  used  WGS,  however.  The review  authors  noted,  \"Whole  genome  sequencing  \nalways  results  in substantially  longer  lists of variants  of unknown  significance  than  whole  exome  \nsequencing  does.  Interpreting  and acting  upon  variants  of unknown  clinical  significance  is the single  \ngreatest  challenge  identified  by clinicians….”45, \nClinically  Useful  \nA test is clinically  useful  if the use of the results  informs  management  decisions  that improve  the net \nhealth  outcome  of care.  The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  or \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WGS  to diagnose  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a \nneurodevelopmental  disorder  outside  of critical  care  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nClinical  validity  is established  based  on the meaningful  diagnostic  yield  associated  with  WGS  when  a \ngenetic  etiology  is uncertain  after  standard  workup.  Studies  on WGS  report  changes  in management  \nthat would  improve  health  outcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as \nthose  with  WES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   29 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Children  with  Multiple  Congenital  Anomalies  or a \nNeurodevelopmental  Disorder  of Unknown  Etiology  Following  Standard  Workup;  Individuals  who  are \nnot Critically  Ill \nWhole  genome  sequencing  has been  studied  in non-critically  ill children  with  congenital  anomalies  and \ndevelopmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup.  The diagnostic  yield  for WGS  \nhas been  reported  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for interpretation  of \nWGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the diagnostic  yield  \nand that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of WGS  is at least  as high  as \nWES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is unclear  if the additional  \nyield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  outcomes.  Further,  while  \nreporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  across  laboratories,  WGS  \nresults  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of this difference  are \nuncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS reclassification  allowing  a \ndiagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the occurrence  of medical  \nmismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well defined,  and provider  \nreluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS identification  by WGS.  As \nsuch,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  utility.  \nWhole  Genome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  Congenital  \nAnomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of WGS  in patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of the \ngenome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a \nstandard  workup.  \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible.  Several  \nlaboratories  offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  WGS  as a clinical  service.  The \nmedian  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  diagnosis  \nor screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  standard  clinical  \nworkup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  genetic  \ncondition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   30 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOutcomes  \nThere  is no reference  standard  for the diagnosis  of patients  who  have  exhausted  alternative  testing  \nstrategies;  therefore,  diagnostic  yield  will be the clinical  validity  outcome  of interest.  \nThe health  outcomes  of interest  are reduction  in morbidity  due to appropriate  treatment  and \nsurveillance,  the end of the diagnostic  odyssey,  and effects  on reproductive  planning  for parents  and \npotentially  the affected  patient.  \nFalse -positive  test results  can lead  to misdiagnosis  and inappropriate  clinical  management.  False -\nnegative  test results  can lead  to a lack of a genetic  diagnosis  and continuation  of the diagnostic  odyssey.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of WGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  were  \nconsidered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rapid  WGS  or WGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of WGS  has been  studied  in children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  in several  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective.  Studies  are described  in Table  13. The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has \nbeen  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  studies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  \npopulations  and include  little  information  about  associated  changes  in management  following  genetic  \ndiagnosis.  \nTable  13.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  RCTs.  \nNo RCTs  assessing  the use of WGS  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  \nunexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  were  identified.  \nChain  of Evidence  \nIndirect  evidence  on clinical  utility  rests  on clinical  validity.  If the evidence  is insufficient  to demonstrate  \ntest performance,  no inferences  can be made  about  clinical  utility.  \nA genetic  diagnosis  for an unexplained  disorder  can alter  management  in several  ways:  such  a diagnosis  \nmay  lead  to genetic  counseling  and ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and may  affect  reproductive  decision  \nmaking.  \nBecause  the clinical  validity  of WGS  for this indication  has not been  established,  a chain  of evidence  \ncannot  be constructed.  \nSection  Summary:  Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for a Suspected  Genetic  Disorder  Other  Than  Multiple  \nCongenital  Anomalies  or a Neurodevelopmental  Disorder;  Individuals  who  are not Critically  Ill \nWhole  genome  sequencing  has also been  studied  in children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  \nthan  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  \nfollowing  standard  workup.  The diagnostic  yield  of WGS  has been  between  9% and 55%.  However,  these  \nstudies  include  mixed  indications  with  heterogeneous  populations  and include  little  information  about  \nassociated  changes  in management  following  genetic  diagnosis.  \nRapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nClinical  Context  and Test  Purpose  \nThe purpose  of rapid  WES  (rWES)  or rWGS  in critically  ill patients  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of \nunknown  etiology  is to establish  a molecular  diagnosis  from  either  the coding  or noncoding  regions  of \nthe genome.  The criteria  under  which  diagnostic  testing  for a genetic  or heritable  disorder  may  be \nconsidered  clinically  useful  are stated  above.  \nThe most  common  cause  of death  in neonates  in the United  States  is genetic  disorders.  Currently,  \ncritically  ill neonates  with  suspected  genetic  diseases  are frequently  discharged  or deceased  without  a \ndiagnosis.  There  are thousands  of rare genetic  disorders.  The presentation  of many  of these  disorders  in \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   34 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nneonates  may  be nonspecific  or differ  from  the presentation  in older  patients  and the disorder  may  \nproduce  secondary  involvement  of other  systems  due to the fragility  of the neonate  that obscures  the \nprimary  pathology.  The neonatal  intensive  care  unit (NICU)  treatment  of suspected  genetic  diseases  is \noften  empirical.  Rapid  diagnosis  is critical  for delivery  of interventions  that reduce  morbidity  and \nmortality  in genetic  diseases  for which  treatments  exist.  For many  genetic  diseases  there  is no effective  \ntreatment  and timely  diagnosis  limits  futile  intensive  care.  \nThe following  PICO  was used  to select  literature  to inform  this review.  \nPopulations  \nThe relevant  population  of interest  is critically  ill infants  presenting  with  any of a variety  of disorders  and \nanomalies  suspected  to have  a genetic  basis  but not explained  by a standard  workup.  For example,  \npatients  may  have  a phenotype  that does  not correspond  with  a specific  disorder  for which  a genetic  \ntest targeting  a specific  gene  is available.  Specifically  for critically  ill infants,  the population  would  also \ninclude  patients  for whom  specific  diagnostic  tests  available  for that phenotype  are not accessible  within  \na reasonable  timeframe.  Petrikin  (2018)  identified  critically  ill infants  that are appropriate  for rapid  \ntesting  as meeting  the following  inclusion  criteria:  multiple  congenital  anomalies;  an abnormal  \nlaboratory  test suggests  a genetic  disease  or complex  metabolic  phenotype;  an abnormal  response  to \nstandard  therapy  for a major  underlying  condition;  significant  hypotonia;  or persistent  seizures.  \nExclusion  criteria  included:  an infection  with  normal  response  to therapy;  isolated  prematurity;  isolated  \nunconjugated  hyperbilirubinemia;  Hypoxic  Ischemic  Encephalopathy;  confirmed  genetic  diagnosis  \nexplains  illness;  Isolated  Transient  Neonatal  Tachypnea;  or nonviable  neonates.53, \nInterventions  \nThe relevant  interventions  being  considered  include:  \n• rapid  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible  \n• rapid  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible  \nSeveral  laboratories  offer  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  Medical  centers  may  also offer  rWES  or \nrWGS  or standard  WES  or WGS  as a clinical  service.  The median  time  for standard  WGS  is several  weeks.  \nIn its 2021  guideline,  the American  College  of Medical  Genetics  and Genomics  defines  rapid  and \nultrarapid  testing  as 6 to 15 days  and 1 to 3 days,  respectively.54, \nNote  that this evidence  review  does  not address  the use of WES  or WGS  for preimplantation  genetic  \ndiagnosis  or screening,  prenatal  (fetal)  testing,  or for testing  of cancer  cells.  \nComparators  \nThe following  practice  is currently  being  used  to diagnose  a suspected  genetic  disorder:  a standard  \nclinical  workup  without  WES  or WGS.  A standard  clinical  workup  for an individual  with  a suspected  \ngenetic  condition  varies  by patient  phenotype  but generally  involves  a thorough  history,  physical  exam  \n(including  dysmorphology  and neurodevelopmental  assessment,  if applicable),  routine  laboratory  \ntesting,  and imaging.  If the results  suggest  a specific  genetic  syndrome,  then  established  diagnostic  \nmethods  relevant  for that syndrome  would  be used.  \nOutcomes  \nOutcomes  of interest  are as described  above  for use of WES  in patients  with  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder.  For critically  ill infants,  rapid  diagnosis  is important;  \ntherefore,  in addition  to the outcomes  described  in the previous  section,  time  to diagnosis  and time  to \ndischarge  are also outcomes  of interest.  \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   35 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nOf course,  mortality  is a compelling  outcome.  However,  many  of the conditions  are untreatable  and \ndiagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care  but may  not \nprolong  survival.  \nStudy  Selection  Criteria  \nFor the evaluation  of clinical  validity  of rWES  or rWGS,  studies  that met the following  eligibility  criteria  \nwere  considered:  \n• Reported  on the diagnostic  yield  or performance  characteristics  such  as sensitivity  and \nspecificity  of rWES  or rWGS;  \n• Patient/sample  clinical  characteristics  were  described;  \n• Patient/sample  selection  criteria  were  described;  \n• Included  at least  20 patients.  \nClinically  Valid  \nA test must  detect  the presence  or absence  of a condition,  the risk of developing  a condition  in the \nfuture,  or treatment  response  (beneficial  or adverse).  \nReview  of Evidence  \nThe use of rWES  and rWGS  has been  studied  in critically  ill children  in multiple  observational  studies,  \nboth  prospective  and retrospective,  and in 3 RCTs.  Studies  are described  in Table  16. The RCTs  are \ndiscussed  in more  detail  in the following  ‘clinically  useful’  section.  One study  included  only  infants  with  \ncardiac  defects  and had a diagnostic  yield  of 6% with  WGS.  The remaining  studies  included  \nphenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill infants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%.  \nTable  16.

The net health  outcome  can be improved  if patients  receive  correct  therapy,  \nmore  effective  therapy,  or avoid  unnecessary  therapy  or testing.  \nDirect  Evidence  \nDirect  evidence  of clinical  utility  is provided  by studies  that have  compared  health  outcomes  for patients  \nmanaged  with  and without  the test.  Because  these  are intervention  studies,  the preferred  evidence  \nwould  be from  randomized  controlled  trials.  \nRandomized  Controlled  Trials  \nThree  RCTs  have  evaluated  rWGS  or rWES  in critically  ill infants  or children.  \nKingsmore  et al (2019)  reported  early  results  of A Randomized,  Blinded,  Prospective  Study  of the Clinical  \nUtility  of Rapid  Genomic  Sequencing  for Infants  in the Acute -care  Setting  (NSIGHT2)  trial66,. NSIGHT2  was \na randomized,  controlled,  blinded  trial of the effectiveness  of rapid  whole -genome  or -exome  \nsequencing  (rWGS  or rWES,  respectively)  in seriously  ill infants  with  diseases  of unknown  etiology  \nprimarily  from  the NICU,  pediatric  intensive  care  unit (PICU),  and cardiovascular  intensive  care  unit \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   42 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \n(CVICU)  at a single  hospital  in San Diego.  Details  of the study  are provided  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. Ninety -five infants  were  randomized  to rWES  and 94 to rWGS.  In addition,  24 infants  \nwho  were  gravely  ill received  ultrarapid  WGS  (urWGS).  The initial  Kingsmore  et al (2019)  publication  \nincluded  only  the diagnostic  outcomes.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. 20%,  \nrespectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  Although  the urWGS  was not part of the \nrandomized  portion  of the study,  the proportion  diagnosed  by urWGS  was 11 of 24 (46%)  and time  to \nresult  was a median  of 4.6 days.  The incremental  diagnostic  yield  of reflexing  to trio testing  after  \ninconclusive  proband  analysis  was 0.7%  (1 of 147).  In 2020,  Dimmock  et al reported  results  of the \nprimary  endpoint  of NSIGHT2:  clinician  perception  that rWGS  was useful  and clinician -reported  changes  \nin management.67, Clinicians  provided  perceptions  of the clinical  utility  of diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  \nfor 201 of 213 infants  randomized  (94%).  In 154 (77%)  infants,  diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  was \nperceived  to be useful  or very  useful;  perceptions  of usefulness  did not differ  between  infants  who  \nreceived  rWES  and rWGS,  nor between  urWGS  and rWES/rWGS.  Thirty -two (15%)  of 207 clinician  \nresponses  indicated  that diagnostic  genomic  sequencing  changed  infant  outcomes  (by targeted  \ntreatments  in 21 [10%]  infants,  avoidance  of complications  in 16 [8%],  and institution  of palliative  care  in \n2 [1%]  infants).  Changes  in outcome  did not differ  significantly  between  infants  randomized  to rWES  and \nrWGS,  although  urWGS  was associated  with  a significantly  higher  rate of change  in management  than  \nrWES/rWGS  (63%  vs. 23%;  p=.0001).  \nPetrikin  et al (2018)  reported  on the Prospective  Randomized  Trial  of the Clinical  Utility  of Rapid  Next  \nGeneration  Sequencing  in Acutely  Ill Neonates  (NSIGHT1;  NCT02225522)  RCT of rWGS  to diagnose  \nsuspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants.53, In brief,  NSIGHT1  was an investigator -initiated  \n(funded  by the National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute  and Eunice  Kennedy  Shriver  National  \nInstitute  of Child  Health  and Human  Development),  blinded,  and pragmatic  trial comparing  trio rWGS  \nwith  standard  genetic  tests  to standard  genetic  tests  alone  with  a primary  outcome  of the proportion  of \nNICU/PICU  infants  receiving  a genetic  diagnosis  within  28 days.  Parents  of patients  and clinicians  were  \nunblinded  after  10 days  and compassionate  cross -over  to rWGS  occurred  in 5 control  patients.  The study  \nwas designed  to enroll  500 patients  in each  group  but was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on \nthe part of study  clinicians  who  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus \ntrio rWGS.  Intention -to-treat  analyses  were  reported,  i.e., crossovers  were  included  in the group  to \nwhich  they  were  randomized.  The trial required  confirmatory  testing  of WGS  results,  which  lengthened  \nthe time  to rWGS  diagnosis  by 7 to 10 days.  Study  characteristics  are shown  in Table  19 and results  are \nshown  in Table  20. \nIn the NICUSeq  RCT,  Krantz  et al (2021)  compared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  \nreporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  \nunit (ICU)  with  a suspected  genetic  disease  at 5 sites  in the US.68, In 76%  of cases,  both  parents  were  \navailable  for trio testing.  Overall,  82 of 354 infants  received  a diagnosis  (23%),  with  a higher  yield  in the \n15-day group  (Table  19). The primary  outcome  was change  in management,  measured  at day 60. \nSignificantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  the delayed  \narm (21.1%  vs 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Changes  in management  included  \nsubspecialty  referral  (21 of 354,  6.0%),  changes  to medication  (5 of 354,  1.4%),  therapeutics  specific  to \nthe primary  genetic  etiology  (7 of 354;  2.0%)  and surgical  interventions  (12 of 354;  3.4%).  Survival  and \nlength  of stay did not differ  between  the groups.  \nTable  19.

Studies  on rWGS  report  changes  in management  that would  improve  health  \noutcomes.  The effect  of WGS  results  on health  outcomes  are the same  as those  with  WES,  including  \navoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  discontinuation  of or \nadditional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.  A chain  of evidence  linking  \nmeaningful  improvements  in diagnostic  yield  and changes  in management  expected  to improve  health  \noutcomes  supports  the clinical  value  of WES  and WGS  for critically  ill infants.  \nSection  Summary:  Rapid  Whole  Exome  or Genome  Sequencing  in Critically  Ill Infants  or Children  \nFor critically  ill infants,  disease  may  progress  rapidly  and genetic  diagnoses  must  be made  quickly.  \nSeveral  retrospective  and prospective  observational  studies  with  sample  sizes  ranging  from  about  20 to \nmore  than  275 (in total  including  more  than  450 critically  ill infants  or children)  reported  on diagnostic  \nyield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse,  but critically  ill, infants  and had \nyields  between  30%  and 60%  and reports  of changes  in management  such  as avoidance  of invasive  \nprocedures,  medication  changes,  discontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  \ncare.  \nThree  RCTs  have  evaluated  rWGS  in critically  ill infants  or children.  An RCT comparing  trio rWGS  with  \nstandard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in critically  ill infants  funded  by the \nNational  Institutes  of Health  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise  on the part of study  clinicians  \nwho  began  to regard  standard  tests  alone  as inferior  to standard  tests  plus trio rWGS.  The rate of \ngenetic  diagnosis  within  28 days  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; \np=.003)  and the time  to diagnosis  was shorter  (13 days  vs. 107 days;  p=.002).  The age at hospital  \ndischarge  and mortality  rates  were  similar  in the 2 groups.  However,  many  of the conditions  are \nuntreatable  and diagnosis  of an untreatable  condition  may  lead  to earlier  transition  to palliative  care,  \nbut may  not prolong  survival.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill infants  with  diseases  \nof unknown  etiology  from  the NICU,  PICU,  and CVICU.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was \nsimilar  (19%  vs. 20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT \ncompared  rWGS  (test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  \nreturned  in 60 days)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an ICU with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  \nSummary  of Evidence  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  receive  whole  \nexome  sequencing  (WES)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  large  case  series  and \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   47 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nwithin -subject  comparisons.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in \nreproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  Patients  who  have  multiple  congenital  anomalies  \nor a developmental  disorder  with  a suspected  genetic  etiology,  but whose  specific  genetic  alteration  is \nunclear  or unidentified  by a standard  clinical  workup,  may  be left without  a clinical  diagnosis  of their  \ndisorder,  despite  a lengthy  diagnostic  workup.  For a substantial  proportion  of these  patients,  WES  may  \nreturn  a likely  pathogenic  variant.  Several  large  and smaller  series  have  reported  diagnostic  yields  of \nWES  ranging  from  25%  to 60%,  depending  on the individual’s  age,  phenotype,  and previous  workup.  \nOne comparative  study  found  a 44%  increase  in yield  compared  with  standard  testing  strategies.  Many  \nof the studies  have  also reported  changes  in patient  management,  including  medication  changes,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  ending  the diagnostic  odyssey,  and family  planning.  The \nevidence  is sufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  congenital  \nanomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  who  \nreceive  WES  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  small  case  series  and prospective  \nresearch  studies.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  \ndecision  making,  and resource  utilization.  There  is an increasing  number  of reports  evaluating  the use of \nWES  to identify  a molecular  basis  for disorders  other  than  multiple  congenital  anomalies  or \nneurodevelopmental  disorders.  The diagnostic  yields  in these  studies  range  from  as low as 3% to 60%.  \nSome  studies  have  reported  on the use of a virtual  gene  panel  with  restricted  analysis  of disease -\nassociated  genes,  and WES  data  allow  reanalysis  as new  genes  are linked  to the patient  phenotype.  \nOverall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  disorder,  and clinical  use of WES  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage  with  uncertainty  about  changes  in patient  management.  The \nevidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  \noutcome.  \nFor individuals  who  have  previously  received  WES  who  receive  repeat  WES,  including  re-analysis  of \nprevious  test results,  the evidence  includes  nonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  There  is no direct  evidence  of clinical  utility.  In a meta -analysis  of nonrandomized  studies,  re-\nanalysis  of WES  data  resulted  in an 11%  increase  in diagnostic  yield  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI), 8% to \n14%)  in individuals  who  were  previously  undiagnosed  via WES.  Three  nonrandomized  studies  published  \nafter  the meta -analysis  had findings  consistent  with  the meta -analysis.  Conclusions  were  limited  by \nheterogeneity  across  individual  studies  and a lack of detailed  reporting  on reasons  for new  diagnoses,  \nchanges  in management  based  on new  diagnoses,  and the frequency  of the identification  of variants  of \nuncertain  significance  (VUS).  Therefore,  a chain  of evidence  for clinical  utility  cannot  be established.  \nAdditionally,  the optimal  timing  of re-analysis  has not been  established,  and there  are no clear  \nguidelines  on what  factors  should  prompt  the decision  to repeat  testing.  The evidence  is insufficient  to \ndetermine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  who  are not critically  ill with  multiple  unexplained  congenital  anomalies  \nor a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  workup  or WES  who  \nreceive  whole  genome  sequencing  (WGS)  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  \nnonrandomized  studies  and a systematic  review.  Relevant  outcomes  are test validity,  functional  \noutcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  In studies  of children  with  \ncongenital  anomalies  and developmental  delays  of unknown  etiology  following  standard  clinical  workup,  \nthe yield  of WGS  has ranged  between  20%  and 40%.  A majority  of studies  described  methods  for \ninterpretation  of WGS  indicating  that only  pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants  were  included  in the \ndiagnostic  yield  and that VUS were  frequently  not reported.  In a systematic  review,  the pooled  (9 \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   48 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nstudies,  N=648)  diagnostic  yield  of WGS  was 40%  (95%  CI, 32%  to 49%).  Although  the diagnostic  yield  of \nWGS  is at least  as high  as WES  in individuals  without  a diagnosis  following  standard  clinical  workup,  it is \nunclear  if the additional  yield  results  in actionable  clinical  management  changes  that improve  health  \noutcomes.  Further,  while  reporting  practices  of VUS found  on exome  and genome  sequencing  vary  \nacross  laboratories,  WGS  results  in the identification  of more  VUS than  WES.  The clinical  implications  of \nthis difference  are uncertain  as more  VUS findings  can be seen  as potential  for future  VUS \nreclassification  allowing  a diagnosis.  However,  most  VUS do not relate  to the patient  phenotype,  the \noccurrence  of medical  mismanagement  and patient  stress  based  on misinterpretation  of VUS is not well \ndefined,  and provider  reluctance  to interpret  VUS information  lessen  the value  of additional  VUS \nidentification  by WGS.  As such,  higher  yield  and higher  VUS from  WGS  currently  have  limited  clinical  \nutility.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  results  in an improvement  in the \nnet health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are children  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  other  than  multiple  unexplained  \ncongenital  anomalies  or a neurodevelopmental  disorder  of unknown  etiology  following  a standard  \nworkup  who  receive  WGS  with  trio testing  when  possible,  the evidence  includes  case  series.  Relevant  \noutcomes  are test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  \nutilization.  Whole  genome  sequencing  has also been  studied  in other  genetic  conditions  with  yield  \nranging  from  9% to 55%.  Overall,  a limited  number  of patients  have  been  studied  for any specific  \ndisorder,  and clinical  use of WGS  as well as information  regarding  meaningful  changes  in management  \nfor these  disorders  is at an early  stage.  The evidence  is insufficient  to determine  that the technology  \nresults  in an improvement  in the net health  outcome.  \nFor individuals  who  are critically  ill infants  with  a suspected  genetic  disorder  of unknown  etiology  \nfollowing  a standard  workup  who  receive  rapid  WGS  (rWGS)  or rapid  WES  (rWES)  with  trio testing  when  \npossible,  the evidence  includes  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and case  series.  Relevant  outcomes  \nare test validity,  functional  outcomes,  changes  in reproductive  decision  making,  and resource  utilization.  \nOne RCT comparing  rWGS  with  standard  genetic  tests  to diagnose  suspected  genetic  disorders  in \ncritically  ill infants  was terminated  early  due to loss of equipoise.  The rate of genetic  diagnosis  within  28 \ndays  of enrollment  was higher  for rWGS  versus  standard  tests  (31%  vs. 3%; p=.003).  Changes  in \nmanagement  due to test results  were  reported  in 41%  (p=.11)  of rWGS  versus  21%  of control  patients;  \nhowever,  73%  of control  subjects  received  broad  genetic  tests  (e.g., next -generation  sequencing  panel  \ntesting,  WES,  or WGS)  as part of standard  testing.  A second  RCT compared  rWGS  to rWES  in seriously  ill \ninfants  with  diseases  of unknown  etiology  from  the neonatal  intensive  care  unit,  pediatric  intensive  care  \nunit,  and cardiovascular  intensive  care  unit.  The diagnostic  yield  of rWGS  and rWES  was similar  (19%  vs. \n20%,  respectively),  as was time  to result  (median,  11 vs. 11 days).  The NICUSeq  RCT compared  rWGS  \n(test  results  returned  in 15 days)  to a delayed  reporting  group  (WGS  with  test results  returned  in 60 \ndays)  in 354 infants  admitted  to an intensive  care  unit with  a suspected  genetic  disease.  Diagnostic  yield  \nwas higher  in the rWGS  group  (31.0%;  95%  CI, 25.5%  to 38.7%  vs. 15.0%;  95%  CI, 10.2%  to 21.3%).  \nAdditionally,  significantly  more  infants  in the rWGS  group  had a change  in management  compared  with  \nthe delayed  arm (21.1%  vs. 10.3%;  p=.009;  odds  ratio,  2.3; 95%  CI, 1.22  to 4.32).  Several  retrospective  \nand prospective  studies  including  more  than  800 critically  ill infants  and children  in total  have  reported  \non diagnostic  yield  for rWGS  or rWES.  These  studies  included  phenotypically  diverse  but critically  ill \ninfants  and had yields  of between  30%  and 60%  for pathogenic  or likely  pathogenic  variants.  Studies  \nhave  also reported  associated  changes  in patient  management  for patients  receiving  a diagnosis  from  \nrWGS  or rWES,  including  avoidance  of invasive  procedures,  medication  changes  to reduce  morbidity,  \ndiscontinuation  of or additional  testing,  and initiation  of palliative  care  or reproductive  planning.

Priority  will be given  to guidelines  that are \ninformed  by a systematic  review,  include  strength  of evidence  ratings,  and include  a description  of \nmanagement  of conflict  of interest.  \nAmerican  Academy  of Neurology  et al \nIn 2014,  the American  Academy  of Neurology  and American  Association  of Neuromuscular  and \nElectrodiagnostic  Medicine  issued  evidence -based  guidelines  on the diagnosis  and treatment  of limb -\ngirdle  and distal  dystrophies,  which  made  the following  recommendations  (Table  23).69, \nTable  23. Guidelines  on Limb -Girdle  Muscular  Dystrophy  \nRecommendation  LOE \nDiagnosis   \n• For patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy,  clinicians  should  use a clinical  approach  to guide  \ngenetic  diagnosis  based  on the clinical  phenotype,  including  the pattern  of muscle  involvement,  \ninheritance  pattern,  age at onset,  and associated  manifestations  (e.g., early  contractures,  cardiac  \nor respiratory  involvement).  B \n• In patients  with  suspected  muscular  dystrophy  in whom  initial  clinically  directed  genetic  testing  \ndoes  not provide  a diagnosis,  clinicians  may  obtain  genetic  consultation  or perform  parallel  \nsequencing  of targeted  exomes,  whole -exome  sequencing,  whole -genome  screening,  or next -\ngeneration  sequencing  to identify  the genetic  abnormality.  C \nManagement  of cardiac  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  refer  newly  diagnosed  patients  with  (1) limb -girdle  muscular  dystrophy  \n(LGMD)1A,  LGMD1B,  LGMD1D,  LGMD1E,  LGMD2C –K, LGMD2M –P, … or (2) muscular  dystrophy  \nwithout  a specific  genetic  diagnosis  for cardiology  evaluation,  including  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  \nand structural  evaluation  (echocardiography  or cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  [MRI]),  even  \nif they  are asymptomatic  from  a cardiac  standpoint,  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• If ECG or structural  cardiac  evaluation  (e.g., echocardiography)  has abnormal  results,  or if the \npatient  has episodes  of syncope,  near -syncope,  or palpitations,  clinicians  should  order  rhythm  \nevaluation  (e.g., Holter  monitor  or event  monitor)  to guide  appropriate  management.  B \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  palpitations,  symptomatic  or \nasymptomatic  tachycardia  or arrhythmias,  or signs  and symptoms  of cardiac  failure  for cardiology  \nevaluation.  B \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2A,  LGMD2B,  and LGMD2L  for cardiac  \nevaluation  unless  they  develop  overt  cardiac  signs  or symptoms.  B \nManagement  of pulmonary  complications   \n• Clinicians  should  order  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  \ninspiratory/expiratory  force  in the upright  and,  if normal,  supine  positions)  or refer  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  (to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency)  in muscular  dystrophy  patients  at the \ntime  of diagnosis,  or if they  develop  pulmonary  symptoms  later  in their  course.  B \n• In patients  with  a known  high  risk of respiratory  failure  (e.g., those  with  LGMD2I  …), clinicians  \nshould  obtain  periodic  pulmonary  function  testing  (spirometry  and maximal  inspiratory/expiratory  B \n\n \n \nOriginal  Policy  Date:  September  2013   Page:   50 \n  \n MP 2.04.102  \nWhole  Exome  and Whole  Genome  Sequencing  for Diagnosis  of Genetic  Disorders  \n \nforce  in the upright  position  and,  if normal,  in the supine  position)  or evaluation  by a \npulmonologist  to identify  and treat  respiratory  insufficiency.  \n• It is not obligatory  for clinicians  to refer  patients  with  LGMD2B  and LGMD2L  for pulmonary  \nevaluation  unless  they  are symptomatic.  C \n• Clinicians  should  refer  muscular  dystrophy  patients  with  excessive  daytime  somnolence,  \nnonrestorative  sleep  (e.g., frequent  nocturnal  arousals,  morning  headaches,  excessive  daytime  \nfatigue),  or respiratory  insufficiency  based  on pulmonary  function  tests  for pulmonary  or sleep  \nmedicine  consultation  for consideration  of noninvasive  ventilation  to improve  quality  of life.

States  can define  EHBs  for their  respective  state.  \nStates  vary  on how  they  define  the term  small  group.  In Idaho,  a small  group  employer  is defined  as an \nemployer  with  at least  two but no more  than  fifty eligible  employees  on the first day of the plan  or \ncontract  year,  the majority  of whom  are employed  in Idaho.   Large  group  employers,  whether  they  are \nself-funded  or fully  insured,  are not required  to offer  EHBs,  but may  voluntar ily offer  them.   \nThe ACA requires  any benefit  plan  offering  EHBs  to remove  all dollar  limits  for EHBs.  \nREFERENCES  \n1.
